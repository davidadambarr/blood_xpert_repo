We have previously used a PCR to detect circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in blood samples from patients (mostly HIV-infected) with pulmonary tuberculosis. We have now prospectively investigated the role of this blood-based PCR assay for diagnosis of this disease in a clinical setting. METHODS: Our PCR assay is specific for the IS6110 insertion element of the M tuberculosis complex of organisms. We used it to test peripheral blood from 88 consecutive patients admitted to a chest ward with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Personnel who carried out the assay did not know the results of any clinical investigations and ultimate diagnosis, and clinicians did not know the PCR results. Results of the PCR assay were compared with the final clinical diagnosis. A subgroup of 15 patients had blood samples assayed serially to track the PCR signal over time. FINDINGS: 41 patients had a final clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis, and the cases were typical of those seen at our hospital: HIV infection was common, and most cases were not sputum-smear positive for acid-fast bacilli. The PCR assay correctly identified 39 of 41 patients with proven pulmonary tuberculosis, 26 (63%) of whom were sputum-smear negative. There were five patients in whom a positive PCR result did not accord with the final clinical diagnosis, and two of the 44 negative PCR results were classified as false negatives. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay for a diagnosis of tuberculosis was 95% and 89%, respectively. In 15 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and a positive blood assay,the PCR result remained positive after 1 month of therapy, but had reverted to negative in 13 of the 15 by 4 months of therapy. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that peripheral-blood-based PCR detection for the diagnosis of tuberculosis is a technically feasible approach that has a potentially important role in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis."

The inhibitory activity of clinical material can be decreased by additional purification of DNA by gel filtration on microcolumns. The method was developed using blood-containing specimens and tried on many clinical specimens. Commercial PCR kit for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis was used. The proposed method for DNA purification notably improves the efficacy of detecting the agents by PCR.

At present, the diagnosis of TB depends on the detection of either mycobacteria or mycobacterial products from clinical specimens. Given the risks posed to both the patient and health care providers by undiagnosed and/or untreated TB, the ability to diagnose TB rapidly in the ICU cannot be understated. In this regard, nucleic acid amplification tests provide relatively quick information about the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) DNA. If available, a blood-based test that would accurately identify persons with TB would be of use in the ICU. Currently available tests such as the T-Spot.TB or QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube can discern infection with Mtb, but are not recommended for the ICU as they cannot rule out TB. In this review, we will discuss the increasing literature that would suggest that a blood-based diagnostic that reflects the host response to TB could be used to diagnose TB in the ICU."

The clinical diagnostic procedure for TB is time-consuming and laborious. In the last 20 years, real-time fluorescence-based quantitative PCR (real-time PCR) has become a better alternative for TB diagnosis in clinics due to its sensitivity and specificity. Recently, digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) has been developed, and it might be an ideal alternative to conventional real-time PCR for microorganism detection. In this study, we aimed to assess the capacity of ddPCR and real-time PCR for detecting low levels of circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA. The study involved testing whole blood samples for an MTB DNA target (known as IS6110). Blood samples were obtained from 28 patients with pulmonary TB, 28 patients with extrapulmonary TB, and 28 healthy individuals. The results show that ddPCR could be used to measure low levels of MTB DNA, and it has the potential to be used to diagnose pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB based on clinical samples."

We developed a simple and efficient DNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocol for mycobacterial detection and quantification in paucibacillary specimens. The method was refined using an in vitro model mimicking blood specimens which are characterized by the presence of numerous qPCR inhibitors. Mycobacterial DNA detection in blood is of interest given the high sensitivity we previously reported using conventional PCR in blood of patients with tuberculosis lymphadenitis. Mechanical lysis of mycobacteria in the presence of an organic solvent provided the highest sensitivity. Mycobacterial DNA amplification was compromised when the human:bacterial genome ratio was at least 190:1. Separation of the specimen into bacterial- and host-rich fractions prior to DNA extraction improved mycobacterial DNA detection by 30%. Preliminary testing of our protocol in smear-negative, culture-positive specimens (gastric and lymph node aspirates, pleural and cerebrospinal fluid, and blood) confirmed the applicability of our technique to a range of paucibacillary specimens for the detection, quantification and speciation (M. tuberculosis versus M. avium) of mycobacteria, several weeks before culture results were available. Our protocol provides a novel, efficient and simple strategy to improve the performance of qPCR in paucibacillary specimens, including those with excess human DNA background. This tool is useful to study the pathophysiology of early pulmonary or occult tuberculosis, and for more rapid and accurate diagnosis in difficult to diagnose infections.  2006 Elsevier B.V.

Failure to accurately identify cases of active MTB has serious effects on both patients and the community. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear has poor sensitivity and culture methods have a delay ranging from 1 to 8 weeks for diagnosis. Nucleic acid amplification assays may be suitable candidates for this purpose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, we evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in 190 patients with pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis whom were admitted to Tehran Imam Khomeini hospitals during 2006-2010. Three ml citrated blood samples were obtained from cases. DNA extraction was performed by QIAGEN commercial kit and PCR performed with IS1081 Primer. RESULTS: Fifty six cases had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and 134 were pulmonary. Overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 41.1% and 95.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MTB-PCR assay on PBMC using IS1081 primer has a low sensitivity and now can not use as a single or alternative diagnostic test for tuberculosis. However, with regard to its high specificity can use for help diagnosing of TB in cases have no enough sputum (or other specimens) to examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture."

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is presently seen as a promising alternative to conventional smear microscopy and culture techniques. Undiagnosed fever is a condition where the aetiology could include tuberculosis in a significant percentage. This paper evaluates a nested PCR (nPCR) using Hotstar Taq for the detection of M. tuberculosis in patients with febrile illness using insertion element, IS6110 as a target. Material and Methods: A total of 355 samples (301 HIV status unknown and 54 HIV seropositives) from patients primarily with febrile illness were tested for the presence of M. tuberculosis. Blood culture was done in a commercial automated blood culture system and nPCR in DNA extracts from buffy coat samples. Hotstar Taq polymerase was used to enhance the sensitivity of nPCR and the lower limit of detection was determined by using cloned plasmid. Results: Among the patients tested, 2% were positive by automated culture system and 6.8% of patients were positive by nPCR. Majority of the positives were from HIV seropositive individuals. The sensitivity of the nPCR was 100% and the specificity was 95.1%. The lower limit of detection was less than 1 genome copy per microlitre. Among the nPCR positives, patients from rural community were significantly higher than from the peri-urban community. Conclusions: The nPCR had a high sensitivity and specificity on buffy coat samples using Hotstar Taq polymerase in the reaction mix. Thus the technique is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of tuberculosis."

A total of 508 clinical specimens (blood 343, menstrual fluid 53, endometrial tissue 43, body fluid 36, pus from lymph nodes 18, sputum 8, urine 5 and semen 2) were included in this study. We extracted DNA using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and performed real-time assay using Rotor-Gene Q machine from Corbett Research, Australia for specific amplification of IS6110 sequence of mycobacterial genome. The RT-PCR result was also compared with bacterial culture and acid-fast bacillus staining. RT-PCR assay showed positivity in 52 cases and negative in 456 cases. Corresponding positive results in culture and acid-fast bacillus staining methods were 49 cases and 24 cases respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis by RT-PCR were 93.87% and 98.69% respectively taking positive culture results as reference standards. The overall positive and negative predictive values were 88.46% and 99.34% respectively. RT-PCR is a useful diagnostic tool for rapid and sensitive detection of mycobacteria in different clinical samples. The easy processing, fast reporting and relative lack of contamination issues make it worthy as a possible replacement to time consuming culture techniques. Moreover, it has added advantage of quantification of mycobacterial DNA, hence bacterial load."

Since, the infection rate with this bacteria increasing and one of the reasons for this increase is long process of laboratory identification, therefore establishing new diagnosis methods could decrease disease rate. To achieve this aim, collected sputum and blood specimens from 50 patients with clinical suspicion of pulmonary tuberculosis were studied with both traditional, acid-fast stain (AFB) and culture method compare to Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) (IgG and IgM) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods. The sensitivity and specificity of all methods were determined by using the PCR results as the gold standard. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of AFB were 17.64, 100,100 and 70.12%. These values for culture method was 29.41, 100, 100 and 73.33% and for IgG antibody were 66.7, 81.81, 64.7 and 81.81% and IgM antibody were 70.58, 90.9, 80 and 85.71%, respectively.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from January 2001 to December 2010. METHODOLOGY: Different clinical specimens received for Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR were dealt during the study period. Contaminated samples like sputum were processed by the standard N-acetyl L-cysteine (NALC)-NaOH method. PCR protocols were followed as per manufacturer's manual. PCR was performed using a Thermal Cycler (Master Cycler, Eppendorf, Germany): an initial denaturation step at 94C for 3 minutes was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94C for 30 seconds, annealing at 60C for 30 seconds and extension at 72C for 30 seconds and a final extension at 72C for 7 minutes. The products were held at 4C and later run on 1% agarose gel, stained with Ethidium bromide and visualized in ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator. RESULTS: Out of a total 4620 samples for PCR, 299 were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6.5%). The percentage of samples from male patients were 63.2%. The mean age of patients was 38+11.5 years. Blood was the most frequent specimen received for PCR (46.66%), followed by body fluids (18.41%) and CSF (10.64%). Yield for different clinical samples was 63/471 for sputum (13.4%), 3/29 for endobronchial washings (10.3%), 59/851 for body fluids (6.9%) and 24/400 for urine (6%). Positive yield from blood was the lowest (101/2156, 4.7%). CONCLUSION: PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The highest positive yield was obtained from sputum and lowest from blood specimens."

We have improved our previously reported PCR based on the amplification of a fragment of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex-specific insertion element IS6110 with respect to both problems. False-positive reactions caused by amplicon contamination were prevented by the use of uracil-N-glycosylase and dUTP instead of dTTP. We selected a new set of primers outside the region spanned by the formerly used primers to avoid false-positive reactions caused by dTTP-containing amplicons still present in the laboratory. With this new primer set, 16 copies of the IS6110 insertion element, the equivalent of two bacteria, could be amplified 10(10) times in 40 cycles, resulting in a mean efficiency of 77% per cycle. To detect the presence of inhibitors of the Taq polymerase, which may cause false-negative reactions, part of each sample was spiked with M. tuberculosis DNA. The DNA purification method using guanidinium thiocyanate and diatoms effectively removed most or all inhibitors of the PCR. However, this was not suitable for blood samples, for which we developed a proteinase K treatment followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. This method permitted detection of 20 M. tuberculosis bacteria per ml of whole blood. Various laboratory procedures were introduced to reduce failure or inhibition of PCR and avoid DNA cross contamination. We have tested 218 different clinical specimens obtained from patients suspected of having tuberculosis. The samples included sputum (n=145), tissue biopsy samples (n=25), cerebrospinal fluid (n=15), blood (n=14), pleural fluid (n=9), feces, (n=7), fluid from fistulae (n=2), and pus from a wound (n=1). The results obtained by PCR were consistent with those obtained with culture, which is the ""gold standard."" We demonstrate that PCR is a useful technique for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis at various sites."

In this test, a 245-bp sequence of the insertion element IS986 was amplified and detected by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide and by Southern blot and dot blot hybridization by using a 188-bp digoxigenin-labeled probe. We tested clinical specimens from 227 patients suspected of having tuberculosis. These included 102 cerebrospinal fluid, 48 sputum, 18 pleural fluid, 5 bronchoalveolar lavage, 18 blood, 7 pus, 8 bone marrow, and 6 urine samples and 15 tissue biopsy specimens. We also tested sputum samples from 75 patients with diseases other than tuberculosis. Sputum samples were first decontaminated, and all samples were treated with proteinase K-detergent solution to extract the DNA. Part of each sample was spiked with M. tuberculosis to provide a semiquantitative assay and to control for the loss of mycobacteria or interference with the PCR which may cause false-negative results. One femtogram of M. tuberculosis DNA could be detected. PCR was positive for all 32 culture-positive (for M. tuberculosis) and Ziehl-Neelsen staining (ZN)-positive samples, 10 of 12 culture-positive and ZN-negative samples, and all 4 culture-negative and ZN-positive samples. PCR detected M. tuberculosis complex bacteria in 35 of 178 culture- and ZN-negative samples. Clinical data supported the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the majority of the 35 patients from whom those samples were obtained."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a benzyl-alcohol guanidine hydrochloride (DNA extraction) method (GuHClM) on blood samples. DESIGN: GuHClM was evaluated in quantitatively spiked blood samples with M. tuberculosis. We assessed the insertion sequence (IS) 6110 region of M. tuberculosis to evaluate the efficacy of the method. The method was also applied on 102 clinical samples of suspected tuberculosis (TB) individuals and compared with smear microscopy of sputum specimens and the results of cultures. RESULTS: This method reproducibly detected as low as 4-6 bacilli. Of 102 clinical samples, 84 were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative, while 18 were HIV-positive. Among the HIV-negative individuals, 58.3% were TB-positive using PCR, while respectively 47.6% and 45.2% were sputum- and culture-positive. Among the HIV-positive individuals, 55.6% were PCR-positive, whereas only 38.9% were sputum-positive and 50% were culture-positive. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the identification of mycobacteria by PCR using GuHClM is very sensitive and therefore may have wide utility in the diagnosis of TB."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-five samples from 145 clinically suspected cases of tuberculosis were processed for the detection of Mycobacterial infections by ZN (Ziehl Neelsen) smear examination, L-J & BACTEC MGIT-960 culture and multiplex PCR tests. The multiplex PCR comprised of genus-specific primers targeting hsp65 gene, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex-specific primer targeting cfp10 (Rv3875, esxB) region and Mycobacterium avium complex-specific primer pairs targeting 16S-23S Internal Transcribed Spacer sequences. The multiplex PCR developed had an analytical sensitivity of 10 fg (3-4 cells) of mycobacterial DNA. The multiplex PCR test showed the highest (77.24%) detection rate, while ZN smear examination had the lowest (20%) detection rate, which was bettered by L-J culture (34.4%) and BACTEC MGIT-960 culture (50.34%) methods. The mean isolation time for M. tuberculosis was 19.03 days in L-J culture and 8.7 days in BACTEC MGIT-960 culture. Using the multiplex PCR, we could establish M. tuberculosis + M. avium co-infection in 1.3% HIV-negative and 2.9% HIV-positive patients. The multiplex PCR was also highly useful in diagnosing mycobacteraemia in 38.09% HIV-positive and 15.38% HIV-negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: The developed in-house multiplex PCR could identify and differentiate the M. tuberculosis and M. avium complexes from other Mycobacterial species directly from clinical specimens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The triplex PCR developed by us could be used to detect and differentiate M. tuberculosis, M. avium and other mycobacteria in a single reaction tube."

DESIGN: Prospective analytical study. SETTING: The patients were recruited, managed and followed at the lymphodenopathy clinic, Central Police Hospital, Burr, Khartoum, Sudan. SUBJECTS: Fifty two sequential patients were enrolled. Thirty patients with FNAC diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis and positive PCR for M. tuberculosis complex had a mean age of 26.9 +/- 11.2 years and similar male, female affection. Nine patients with FNAC tuberculous lymphadenitis, but negative PCR had a slightly higher mean age (32.6 +/- 18.2 years) with similar male: female proportions. Patients with reactive lymphadenopathy (9/52) were older than patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis with a mean age of 45 +/- 24.6 years. RESULTS: None of the patients were positive for HIV or had clinical or radiological evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected in the blood samples of 30/39 (77%) patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis, but in none of the cases with reactive or malignant lymphadenopathy. The presence of M. tuberculosis DNA correlated strongly to multiple lymph-node involvement [OR (odds ratio) = 96.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.0 - 1,039] and to caseating-granulomatous and predominantly necrotic cytomorphological categories [OR = 70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.0 - 703]. CONCLUSION: M. tuberculosis most probably disseminates through the blood from one node group to the other in patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis."

By using nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, one may be able to diagnose, the disease on the day of arrival of specimen in the laboratory. For diagnosis of tuberculosis by direct methods like PCR, specimens from site of infection are required. In certain cases it is difficult to get the specimens from site of infection and in such situations; some researchers have tried to detect the DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from blood of these patients. The purposive of this study is to determine the diagnostic efficacy of peripheral blood-based polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: This was a simple descriptive study, carried out in Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi from Jan 2004 to Dec 2004. Sputum and blood samples were collected from 96 suspected patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum samples processed for ZN staining and AFB culture (gold standard) and blood samples processed for PCR. RESULTS: Out of 96 cases, 60 (62.5%) were culture positive. PCR was positive in 14 (14.5%). AFB smear positive were 34 (35.4%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 20% and 94.4% respectively and the positive and negative predictive values were 85.71% and 41.46% respectively. The overall efficiency of the test was 47.91%. CONCLUSION: Due to low sensitivity; a negative PCR assay does not rule the disease. However, this test may be helpful in cases where specimens from the site of infection are not available."

Clinical investigators who were unaware of the PCR data classified 162 immunocompetent patients, who had been hospitalized because of suspected pulmonary tuberculosis, in accordance with the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society (ATS). By testing blood samples from these patients for mycobacterial DNA with three different PCR systems, we were able to demonstrate that nonquantitative PCR of peripheral blood leukocytes is of little value for the specific diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. However, semiquantitative PCR assays might have some significance since we found an increasing level of mycobacterial DNA copies in blood from patients classified in ATS groups 2 to 5."

The inadequate sensitivity of Ziehl-Neelsen staining and its inability to distinguish atypical mycobacteria delays accurate diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of TB in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blood and extra-pulmonary samples from patients with AIDS and pulmonary infiltrates. DESIGN: Specimens from 103 HIV-1-infected patients were prospectively analysed using bacteriological methods and IS6110-PCR. Smear-positive samples were also tested using 16S ribosomal-DNA-PCR to identify Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. Gold standard diagnosis relied on positive cultures or treatment outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients exhibited TB, one TB and MAC and four MAC. The sensitivity of IS6110-PCR was 100% in smear-positive samples, 81.8% in smear-negative BAL, 66.7% in extra-pulmonary samples and 42.9% in blood. Its specificity was 97.1% in BAL and 100% in extra-pulmonary and blood specimens. The 16S rDNA-PCR identified M. avium from all smear-positive samples that grew MAC. CONCLUSIONS: IS6110-PCR proved useful in evaluating episodes with probable clinical diagnosis of pulmonary or mixed TB and negative smears, whereas 16S rDNA-PCR would be helpful for prompt differential diagnosis of MAC in smear-positive specimens."

The identification of amplification products was confirmed after electrophoresis by hybridisation with a non-isotopic probe in a DNA enzyme immunoassay (DEIA). Of the 30 blood samples studied by the PCR-DEIA technique, 26 gave positive results and four gave negative results. Blood samples from 30 subjects in a control group were negative by this technique.

Among 17 clinically suspected pulmonary tuberculosis patient's (M:F 65:35) sputum samples, 12 were found positive by both primers. Among 81 routine samples (sputum = 12; blood = 27; cerebrospinal fluid = 16; ascitic fluid = 12 and urine = 14), 12 were found to be positive by IS6110 primer while 13 were found positive by MPB64. The result of M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in sputum, ascitic fluid, CSF and urine samples were found to be similar in both the primers used. It is suggested that, M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in blood samples using MPB64 primers sometime gives false positive result and therefore, may not be recommended for blood samples. As in other samples both the primers gave almost the same result and therefore, both the primers can be used for MTB DNA PCR vice versa in order to cross check if one gives dubious result."

This assay is only validated for respiratory specimens, but many physicians also request PCR analyses for non-respiratory ones. 877 respiratory and 564 non-respiratory specimens were analysed by this test. Using culture results as standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of the PCR were, respectively, 97.9%, 100%, 100% and 94.4% for smear-positive respiratory specimens, 68.8%, 99.2%, 87.5% and 97.5% for smear-negative respiratory samples, 57.8%, 98.6%, 78.8% and 96.4% for all non-respiratory specimens, and 42.4%, 98.6%, 66.7% and 96.4% for smear-negative non-respiratory specimens. 154 cerebrospinal fluid samples were analysed and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 55.6%, 97.2%, 55.6% and 97.2%, respectively. These results indicate that the Cobas Amplicor MTB test enables detection of tuberculosis in respiratory specimens, but does not perform well enough in non-respiratory specimens. The method fails particularly in cases where a reliable and rapid test is urgently needed, e.g. in tuberculous meningitis."

Conventional methods are of limited use in diagnosing this form of the disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has emerged as a sensitive and specific tool for documenting the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical samples but lacks quantitative ability. The present study evaluates peripheral blood as an alternative clinical specimen for diagnosing EPTB. Peripheral blood samples from 38 EPTB and 89 non tuberculous subjects were analyzed for the presence of tubercle bacilli by MPB 64 gene based PCR method. The assay gave an overall sensitivity of 60.53% with negative predictive value of 76.92% which is superior to present gold standard of mycobacterial culture (10.53 and 72.36%). Additionally, 43.82% of non tuberculous subjects gave positive results with the PCR, thus mitigating the clinical utility of this test. An in-house Competitive PCR (C-PCR) assay was used to determine the mycobacterial load in peripheral blood from culture positive, culture negative EPTB patients and non tuberculous controls which ranged from 7498-12498, 602-4797 and 101-800 genome equivalent (ge)/mL, respectively. The data clearly demonstrated that C-PCR assay can furnish insightful information in diagnosing extra pulmonary disease."

METHODS: Detection of the M. tuberculosis complex in blood samples using as a target the insertion sequence IS6110 of the genomic DNA of the bacillus. Blood samples of 120 patients were evaluated. All of the patients were under 15 years of age at the time of their treatment at public hospitals in the city of Recife, Brazil (between January of 2003 and August of 2005). Attending physicians at the hospitals diagnosed TB based on the criteria recommended by the American Thoracic Society. The nPCR amplified a 123-bp fragment with outer oligonucleotides (IS1/IS2) and, in the subsequent reaction, using inner oligonucleotides (IS3/IS4), generating an 81-bp amplicon. RESULTS: Active or latent TB was found in 65 patients, TB was ruled out in 28 suspected cases, and 27 patients were TB-free (controls). The sensitivity of nPCR was 26.15% and was significantly higher for the extrapulmonary form of the disease (55.56%) than for the pulmonary form (18.18%). The specificity was 92.73%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the difficulties in diagnosing TB in children and the low number of cases evaluated in the present study, nPCR in blood samples proved to be a rapid and specific technique, albeit one with low sensitivity. In order to establish its true usefulness in the diagnosis of paucibacillary forms, especially extrapulmonary TB, further studies need to be carried out with a larger sample of children and analyzing biological specimens other than blood."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical relevance of detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. DESIGN: Single-centre prospective case study of 90 hospitalised patients and 50 healthy subjects or blood donors from 1 January to 30 June 1998. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis (26.7%); 20 tuberculosis patients were culture-positive, with seven smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli. Sensitivity of smear, culture and nested PCR was 30.4 (7/23), 87 (20/23) and 30.4% (7/23), respectively. The specificity of smear and culture was 100%, and the specificity of the nested PCR was 96% in the healthy subjects. However, the specificity decreased to 83.6% in the hospitalised patients, with 11 nested PCR-positive patients without a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The sensitivity of the nested PCR was low in pulmonary tuberculosis (22.2%), but increased in pulmonary/extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (50%), extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (33%), and disseminated tuberculosis (33%). CONCLUSION: The use of a nested PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis with regard to low sensitivity and specificity. However, further studies are needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of paucibacillary forms of tuberculosis."

The specimens included urine; feces; lymph node exudates; pleural, cerebrospinal, articular, and ascitic fluids; tissue biopsies; gastric aspirates; purulent exudates; blood; and bone marrow aspirates. After combination of the culture results and the patient's clinical data, a total of 135 specimens were collected from 122 patients with a diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay were 77.7, 98.7, 95.2, and 93.1%, respectively; these values rose in resolved cases of TB to 78.5, 100, 100, and 93.1%, respectively. For 37 (27.4%) specimens from patients smear positive for the disease and 98 (72.6%) specimens from patients smear negative for the disease, the sensitivities of the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay were 100 and 71.1%, respectively. Statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) in sensitivities were found between culture and the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay. These differences were even greater among smear-negative specimens. The results demonstrate that the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay will provide rapid and valuable information for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a IS6110-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method can be utilized to detect M. tuberculosis in non-pulmonary specimens. DESIGN: Specimens from 286 Mexican patients with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of EPTB were prospectively examined by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, mycobacterial culture on Lwenstein-Jensen slants, and by PCR. The DNA for PCR was extracted by the buffer lysis method and phenol-guanidine thiocyanate-chloroform. Primers that amplify a 200 bp fragment from the insertion-like M. tuberculosis sequence element IS6110 were utilized. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that this PCR method is highly specific (100%) for identifying M. tuberculosis from a variety of specimens including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, and lymph node exudate. Moreover, the sensitivity of PCR for detecting M. tuberculosis in CSF (94%), pleural fluid (94%), ascitic fluid and other extrapulmonary specimens (93%) greatly exceeds the sensitivity of conventional smear and culture methods. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that PCR can be a highly specific and sensitive aid in the detection of M. tuberculosis from extra-pulmonary specimens."

In this study carried out in Karachi, Pakistan, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay aimed at detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC-PCR) was standardized and compared with standard M. tuberculosis diagnostic techniques or a lymph node PCR (LN-PCR) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis lymphadenitis. Thirty-seven (77%) specimens from 48 patients with clinical or diagnosis of tuberculosis lymphadenitis were positive by cytology [17/48 (35%) with no acid fast bacilli (AFB) (suggestive), and 20/48 (42%) with AFB (positive) in direct smears], 30 (63%) by PBMC-PCR, 16 (33%) by LN-PCR, and 13 (27%) by culture. All controls were negative, with the exception of one false-positive LN-PCR. These data suggest the PBMC-PCR may be helpful in the diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis."

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) constitutes the main cause of classic fever of unknown origin (FUO) in many populations. The aim of this study was to improve the diagnostic field of the disease using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, specific for the IS6110 insertion element of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, in order to achieve a more timely diagnosis and treatment. Setting. Twenty-four, HIV-negative classic FUO patients who were admitted to the Regional Hospital of Alexandroupolis between April 1997 and July 1999. Subjects and design. The above patients were considered as putative extrapulmonary TB after 3 weeks of in-patient investigation and underwent exhaustive examination for diagnosis of the disease. For this purpose, specimens were obtained from peripheral blood and bone marrow from these patients, as well as from damaged tissues, and analysed by both PCR and conventional methods. Anti-tuberculous treatment was initiated in 16 out of 24 patients and the response to this regimen was considered as the final criterion for diagnosis of tuberculosis. Results. Extrapulmonary TB was established in 11 patients. The PCR-based methodology, when applied to samples derived from bone marrow aspirations and suspected damaged tissues, was able to diagnose 10 of them, whereas the conventional methods were able to detect only two. Conclusions. Our results confirm the diagnostic value of molecular detection of M. tuberculosis in cases of FUO, thus supporting the application of PCR in tissue samples suspected of bacillus infection. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that bone marrow aspiration specimens constitute an alternative, easy, safe and reliable source for such PCR analysis."

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we have evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in adult patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative and new cases of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. We investigated the relationship between characteristic of the patients, radiological extension of the disease, sputum smear grade, presence of cavity, body-mass index (BMI), serum albumin level, total delay time and PCR positivity. Forty patients (33 male and 7 female; mean age 37.814.1) and 20 healthy control subjects (13 male and 7 female; mean age 35.67.3) were enrolled in this study. PCR was positive in 16 of 40 (40%) patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and negative in 24 of 40 (60%). None of the healthy controls had positive PCR results. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the PCR assay was 40,100 and 60%, respectively. We found the positive correlation between PCR positivity and sputum smear grade (r= 0.46, P=0.003), radiological extension of the disease (r= 0.69, P=0.001), presence of cavity (r= 0.90, P=0.001). We conclude that the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA from peripheral blood by PCR technique is useful for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis patients with HIV-negative. Hematogenous dissemination was important in tuberculosis patients and peripheral blood samples were suitable and easy materials. However, standardization of the PCR method must be ensured for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.  2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

Skeletal tuberculosis is an indolent disease, and diagnosis may be delayed. Conventional methods are time consuming and have a low sensitivity rate. In recent years PCR-based protocols raised hopes as a reliable and fast diagnostic tool for extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The authors report the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA in specimens from six patients using a nested PCR protocol specific for IS6110 insertion element of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Three men and three women are reported with ages ranging from 42 to 68 years. The sites of infection were the knee and shoulder in one case each, the hip in two cases, and the thoracic spine in two cases. Diagnosis was established within three days, and treatment was initiated promptly. PCR is a technically easy approach that can be used as a first step diagnostic tool for early recognition and treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis."

In all the children, blood Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) DNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and MBT antigens (AG) and antibodies (AB) were by enzyme immunoassay. The studies have shown that it is expedient to concurrently determine MBT DNA and MBT AT in order to identify local forms of tuberculosis in children from risk groups. If the tests are positive, a comprehensive examination for tuberculosis is required; the presence of the syndrome of common disturbances is generally associated with tuberculous infection. When a local form of tuberculosis is excluded, preventive chemotherapy should be performed. Further negative tests for MBT DNA and lower MBT AT may be a criterion for the efficiency of preventive treatment. In children with tuberculosis, the results of repeated blood and urine tests for MBT DNA provide a way of evaluating the course of a tuberculous process and the efficiency of chemotherapy. PCR used to determine blood and urine MBT DNA is a highly specific test as positive results were in 79% of the children with tuberculosis."

All smear positive samples were PCR positive except for 7/138 (5.07%) that were false negative because of the presence of inhibitors. However, the use of several samples for each patient minimize the false negative results. The PCR allowed the detection of more positive results in smear negative sputa from HIV- (50%) than in HIV+ patients (20.5%). In contrast, in smear negative blood samples, PCR was positive more frequently in HIV+ (30%) than in HIV- patients (12.5%). Regarding patients, 15/25 HIV+ and 13/17 HIV-patients had at least one positive sample with PCR whereas only 7/25 and 11/17 respectively for HIV+ and HIV- patients had smear positive samples.

All samples were LCx processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reference diagnosis was obtained by the Lwestein-jensen method and when results were inconsistent, we took into account the degree of clinical suspicion, response to treatment and histology. RESULTS: Seven of the 99 samples were positive by the LCx technique, and 6 of the 7 were also LJ positive; 1 could not be evaluated because of culture contamination. One LJ positive culture was LCx negative. Only one sample was positive by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining. Ninety-two samples were LCx negative, with 91 showing no growth at all.

The PCR amplifies a part of the DNA coding for 16S rRNA with a set of primers that is specific for the genus Mycobacterium and that flanks species-specific sequences within the genes coding for 16S rRNA. The PCR product is analyzed in a reverse cross blot hybridization assay with probes specific for M. tuberculosis complex (pTub1), M. avium (pAvi3), M. intracellulare (pInt5 and pInt7), M. kansasii complex-M. scrofulaceum complex (pKan1), M. xenopi (pXen1), M. fortuitum (pFor1), M. smegmatis (pSme1), and Mycobacterium spp. (pMyc5a). The PCR assay can detect 10 fg of DNA, the equivalent of two mycobacteria. The specificities of the probes were tested with 108 mycobacterial strains (33 species) and 31 nonmycobacterial strains (of 17 genera). The probes pAvi3, pInt5, pInt7, pKan1, pXen1, and pMyc5a were specific. With probes pTub1, pFor1, and pSme1, slight cross hybridization occurred. However, the mycobacterial strains from which the cross-hybridizing PCR products were derived belonged to nonpathogenic or nonopportunistic species which do not occur in clinical samples. The test was used on 31 different clinical specimens obtained from patients suspected of having mycobacterial disease, including a patient with a double mycobacterial infection. The samples included sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tissue biopsy samples, cerebrospinal fluid, pus, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, and blood. The results of the PCR assay agreed with those of conventional identification methods or with clinical data, showing that the test can be used for the direct and rapid detection and identification of mycobacteria in clinical samples."

A total of 643 respiratory and 506 nonrespiratory specimens collected from 807 patients were investigated. Of the 95 culture-positive specimens, 80 were COBAS AMPLICOR MTB positive, and of the 1,054 culture-negative specimens, 1,044 were COBAS AMPLICOR MTB negative. After resolving discrepancies by review of the medical history, the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the COBAS AMPLICOR MTB assay, respectively, were 83.5, 98.8, 86.7, and 98.6% compared to those of diagnostic culture. In smear-positive specimens, the sensitivity of the COBAS AMPLICOR MTB assay was 96%, versus 48% for smear-negative specimens. No significant differences in the test performance between respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens were observed. The overall inhibition rate was less than 2%, excluding stool specimens. The clear advantages of the COBAS AMPLICOR PCR system are standardized procedures and reagents for specimen processing as well as an internal control for reliable monitoring of PCR inhibitors. By simplifying the work flow through a completely automated amplification and amplicon detection procedure, the COBAS AMPLICOR PCR system proved itself as a very useful component for routine diagnostic procedures."

METHODS: Twenty individuals with uveitis of presumed infectious origin were evaluated. Sixteen of them had AIDS, four were immunocompetent individuals. We also evaluated 4 normal controls who underwent vitrectomy surgery. Clinical evaluation of the patients was performed together by three clinicians. PCR evaluations of the serum, aqueous, and vitreous humor were performed in a masked fashion by the laboratory staff. RESULTS: Twelve patients had a clinical diagnosis of CMV retinitis. Of these 6 (50%) had a positive PCR for CMV in the vitreous, three (25%) had a positive PCR for CMV in the serum, and none were positive in the aqueous. Five patients had a clinical diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN). Three (60%) of these had positive PCR for HSV/VZV in the vitreous. One of these patients had a positive PCR reaction for both EBV and HSV/VZV in the vitreous samples. One patient with cutaneous herpes zoster had a positive PCR reaction for HSV/VZV in the serum. Four patients had a presumed diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis, one patient (25%) had a positive PCR for Toxoplasma gondii in the serum, 3 (75%) had positive results in the aqueous, and 2 (50%) had positive results in the vitreous. One patient with presumed ocular tuberculosis had a positive PCR reaction both in the serum and in the vitreous samples. Finally, none of the four control individuals revealed any positive PCR reaction. CONCLUSION: PCR is an auxiliary diagnostic procedure that should be evaluated together with ophthalmological aspects of the patient."

The performance of the genus probe was compared with the performance of probes specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium and with that of standard culture. In addition, the utility of an internal control in monitoring amplification inhibitors was studied. Of 545 respiratory and 325 nonrespiratory specimens (a total of 870 specimens), 58 (6.7%) showed the presence of amplification inhibitors, as determined by a negative result for the internal control. Of these 58 specimens, 31 (53%) were stool specimens; other material, even titrate blood after lysis of erythrocytes, did not pose a problem with regard to inhibition of PCR amplification. Eighty-one of the remaining 812 specimens had a positive Mycobacterium culture result. Of these culture-positive specimens, 58 (71.6%) showed a positive result with the Mycobacterium genus-specific probe. Seventy-two samples had a positive result with the Mycobacterium- specific probe but a negative culture result. Of these 72 samples, 26 samples were regarded as true positive, either because the M. tuberculosis- or M. avium-specific probe was also positive at the same time or because other specimens from the same patient taken at the same time were culture positive. The sensitivity of the Mycobacterium-specific probe was 78.5% and the specificity was 93.5%. This study showed that pretesting of clinical specimens for mycobacteria to the genus level with a Mycobacterium-specific probe offers the routine clinical laboratory the possibility of detecting tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria with one test. Furthermore, specimens testing positive with the genus-specific probe can be immediately identified with species specific probes."

The AMTDT is based on amplification of rRNA, whereas the Amplicor MAI Test amplifies a specific DNA region of the 16S rRNA gene. The results of amplification techniques were compared with those of standard culture and culture in BACTEC 13A and BACTEC 12B liquid media. A total of 121 blood specimens and 15 bone marrow aspirates were collected from 136 AIDS patients. Mycobacterial growth was recovered for 103 specimens; 35 yielded M. tuberculosis, 62 yielded M. avium, 5 yielded M. genavense, and 1 yielded M. kansasii. The values of sensitivity and specificity in pretreated specimens for detection of M. tuberculosis by the AMTDT were 94.3 and 100%, respectively, and those for detection of M. avium by the Amplicor MAI Test were 91.9 and 100%, respectively. The simple lysis method described in the present work allows the recovery of mycobacteria from blood specimens and bone marrow aspirates and may be used in combination with the AMTDT and the Amplicor MAI Test to detect and identify different members of the genus Mycobacterium. This method might also be applicable for the identification of mycobacteria from blood culture fluids with acridinium-ester-labeled DNA probes."

With the aim of evaluating the usefulness of a nested-PCR method on samples of blood and urine of patients suspected of tuberculosis we analyzed 192 clinical samples, using as a molecular target the insertion element IS6110 specific of M. tuberculosis genome. Nested-PCR method showed higher sensitivity in patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis (47.8% and 52% in blood and urine) when compared to patients with the pulmonary form of the disease (sensitivity of 29% and 26.9% in blood and urine), regardless of the type of biological sample used. The nested-PCR is a rapid technique that, even if not showing a good sensitivity, should be considered as a helpful tool especially in the extrapulmonary cases or in cases where confirmatory diagnosis is quite difficult to be achieved by routine methods. The performance of PCR-based techniques should be considered and tested in future works on other types of biological specimens besides sputum, like blood and urine, readily obtainable in most cases. The improving of M. tuberculosis nested-PCR detection in TB affected patients will give the possibility of an earlier detection of bacilli thus interrupting the transmission chain of the disease."

The procedure was validated on 55 samples selected for tuberculosis based on clinical criteria. 52 patients had radiological changes indicative of pulmonary tuberculosis of which only 28 were positive for AFB in sputum (sensitivity 54%) and 27 for tuberculin (sensitivity 52%). 26 HIV positive patients who showed positive X-ray did not react to tuberculin. The genus PCR probe missed 3 samples (sensitivity 94%) compared to X-ray. M.tuberculosis was detected in the blood of all X-ray positive cases by PCR using TB400 probe (sensitivity 100%) and another probe for Af. tuberculosis, IS6110, missed 6 of them (sensitivity 88% compared to X-ray and 89% compared to TB400). It is proposed that this simple sample processing method could be used to screen all blood samples quickly for mycobacteremia using the genus PCR and only those positive for mycobacteria need to be tested for M. tuberculosis. This would save the scarce resources and time by reducing significantly the number of samples to be screened for species confirmation."

METHODS: A total of 44 consecutive serum specimens were collected from clinically suspected OTB patients, based on clinical and radiological [X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography] features. They were screened by in-house nested PCR. In addition, a few specimens were examined by Gram stain, acid-fast bacilli stain, histopathology and routine bacterial culture. A total of 39 specimens were collected from patients suffering from other bone diseases of nontuberculous origin and included as negative controls. RESULTS: Of the 44 clinically suspected OTB patients, in-house nested PCR was positive in 40 (91%) cases; PCR was negative in 38 (97%) negative controls. Sensitivity and specificity of our in-house nested PCR was 90.9% and 97.4%, respectively. The PCR report was available within 48 h. It was possible to standardize serum PCR technique and in positive cases, a good correlation was observed in terms of an adequate treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Nested PCR in serum samples is a rapid, highly sensitive and specific modality for OTB detection. PCR should be performed in addition to clinical evaluation, imaging studies, acid-fast bacilli staining, culture and histopathology diagnosis, if possible."

Most guidelines for the diagnosis and management of TBM agree on the use of simple Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis using molecular tools like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). However, the sensitivity of PCR varies while using a CSF sample. In the present study, we have compared the diagnostic utility of PCR assay in both peripheral blood and CSF sample collected from TBM cases. AIM: To evaluate the application of the peripheral blood PCR assay as an alternate tool for TBM diagnosis compared to conventional CSF-PCR based system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 TBM patients were prospectively recruited from in patient department wards of Central India Institute of Medical Sciences (CIIMS) between January 2014 - Feburary 2015. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) specific IS6110 PCR and BactT liquid culture were performed in 20 of recruited cases classified as Stage 1, 2 and 3 based on British Medical Research Council (BMRC) contemporary clinical criteria for the severity of TBM. Clinical characteristics were summarised in terms of percentages for categorical variables, i.e., age groups, gender, signs and symptoms. All statistical analysis was carried out using MedCalc software version 11.6. RESULTS: Overall IS6110 PCR positivity in CSF was around 80% (16/20), which was higher than culture (29.3%) and peripheral blood (39%). Out of 8 positive cases, stage wise positivity of peripheral blood PCR assay in three TBM stages was 0% (stage1) 50% (stage 2) and 67% (Stage 3) respectively. Positivity of peripheral blood PCR was significantly more (86%) in patients with CSF culture/ IS6110 PCR positive for MTB infection with sensitivity and specificity of 50 and 100% respectively. Increased positivity rates of peripheral blood PCR was observed with decreased CSF/Blood sugar ratio in stage 3 cases, suggesting enhanced probability of mycobacterial blood dissemination in cases of TBM severity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that although the molecular diagnosis of TBM infection in CSF remains the method of choice, peripheral blood based PCR can be used as a good alternative to CSF in case of TBM severity where the repeated CSF collection may be needed. However, study demands further validation in large cohorts to justify the present hypothesis."

Tuberculosis spread to almost every organ of the body and is characterized on the basis of localization of infection. Therefore, different types of body fluids and tissues can be used for the detection of MTB.From 2004 to 2010 total 766 different types of smear negative samples from patients, clinically suspected for tuberculosis were received and investigated at Division of Molecular Diagnostics, University of the Punjab Lahore for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Mycobacterial DNA was extracted followed by PCR amplification. FINDINGS: A total of 356 (46.5%) samples were found positive by PCR for MTB. These included; serum (4.8%), blood (36.3%), urine (46.6%), cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) (42.1%), ascetic fluid (67.6%), pleural fluid (52%), pericardial fluid (30%), pus (38.6%), bone marrow (60%), sputum (38.8%) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (70%). Over all there was no significant difference in males and females neither in different age groups for the identification of MTB. CONCLUSION: We conclude that PCR is a useful and sensitive tool for the early diagnosis of MTB in variety of clinical samples."

This study will explore detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb) DNA in CD34 (+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a biomarker for LTBI and monitoring chemoprophylaxis response. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 120 household contacts (60 HIV positive and 60 HIV negative) will be recruited. Also, 10 patients with sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis and 10 visitors from low incidence countries with no history of TB treatment will be recruited as positive and negative controls, respectively. Participants will donate 100 ml (50 ml for TB patients) of blood to isolate PBMCs using density gradient centrifugation. Isolated PBMCs will be separated into CD34 (+) and CD34 (-) enriched cellular fractions. DNA from each fraction will be purified, quantified and subjected to droplet digital PCR targeting IS6110 (a M.tb Complex multi-copy gene) and rpoB, a single copy gene. Also, 4 ml of blood will be drawn for IGRA. In a nested prospective study, 60 HIV positive participants will be given 300 mg of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) daily for six months, after which they will donate a second 100 ml blood sample that will be processed as described above. Data from the cross-sectional study will be analysed to determine the proportion of individuals in whom M.tb DNA is detectable in CD34 (+) and CD34 (-) fractions and number of M.tb genomes present. Data from the prospective study will be analysed to compare the proportion of individuals with detectable M.tb DNA in CD34 (+) and CD34 (-) fractions, and median M.tb genome copy number, post vs pre-IPT. Discussion: This study will determine whether detection of M.tb DNA in CD34 (+) PBMCs holds promise as a biomarker for LTBI and monitoring chemoprophylaxis response."

Current conventional techniques lack sensitivity and are time-consuming. Here, we report our experience with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) using two targets namely IS6110 and protein antigen b in the diagnosis of extra-pulmonary TB. Materials and Methods: A total of 150 patients of extra-pulmonary TB visiting tertiary care center in north India between September 2008 and December 2009 were included in the study. Sixty-six biopsy samples and 84 were body fluids from these patients were subjected for microscopy (Ziehl-Neelsen), culture on LJ medium and for Multiplex PCR using IS6110 and Protein b antigen. Results: Smear positivity was noted in 11 samples (7.33%), and LJ culture yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 8 biopsies and 9 body fluids with overall positivity of 11.3%. The multi-targeted PCR could detect M. tuberculosis in a total of 112 samples. Of 112 positive samples, only Protein b band was detected in 7 samples and only IS6110 was detected in 5 samples. Overall Protein b, PCR could detect 71.33% of the cases, whereas IS6110 was positive in 66.6% of the cases. Overall the sensitivities of microscopy, culture, IS6110 PCR, Protein b PCR and MPCR were 7.33%, 11.3%, 66.67%, 71.3% and 74.6%, respectively. Thus by using more than two targets the sensitivity increased from 66.67% of IS6110 to 74.6% in MPCR. Conclusion: Multiplex polymerase chain reaction using IS6110 and Protein b antigen is a highly sensitive and specific tool in the diagnosis of pauci-bacillary conditions like extra-pulmonary TB."

A total of 508 clinical specimens (blood 343, menstrual fluid 53, endometrial tissue 43, body fluid 36, pus from lymph nodes 18, sputum 8, urine 5 and semen 2) were included in this study. We extracted DNA using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and performed real-time assay using Rotor-Gene Q machine from Corbett Research, Australia for specific amplification of IS6110 sequence of mycobacterial genome. The RT-PCR result was also compared with bacterial culture and acid-fast bacillus staining. RT-PCR assay showed positivity in 52 cases and negative in 456 cases. Corresponding positive results in culture and acid-fast bacillus staining methods were 49 cases and 24 cases respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis by RT-PCR were 93.87% and 98.69% respectively taking positive culture results as reference standards. The overall positive and negative predictive values were 88.46% and 99.34% respectively. RT-PCR is a useful diagnostic tool for rapid and sensitive detection of mycobacteria in different clinical samples. The easy processing, fast reporting and relative lack of contamination issues make it worthy as a possible replacement to time consuming culture techniques. Moreover, it has added advantage of quantification of mycobacterial DNA, hence bacterial load."

The aim of this study was to determine if the Xpert MTB/rifampicin (RIF) assay had additional advantages over nested PCR for the detection of MTB in a geographical area with intermediate tuberculosis (TB) incidence. Methods: Between February and December 2013, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR, as well as AFB smear and culture, were simultaneously performed on 198 clinical samples (160 pulmonary and 38 non-pulmonary specimens) collected from 171 patients hospitalized at Hallym University Medical Center for possible TB. The accuracy of the diagnosis of MTB culture-positive TB and the turnaround time of reporting laboratory results were calculated and compared. Rifampin resistance by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay was reviewed with that of conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). Results: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR for diagnosis of MTB culture-positive pulmonary TB were 86.1% vs. 69.4% (P=0.1563), 97.8% vs. 94.1% (P=0.2173), 91.2% vs. 75.8% (P=0.1695), and 96.4% vs. 92.0% (P=0.2032), respectively. The median turnaround times of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR were 0 [0-4] days and 4 [1-11] days, respectively (P < 0.001). Two cases of rifampin resistance, as determined by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, were found to be multi-drug resistant (MDR) pulmonary TB by DST. Conclusions: The Xpert MTB/RIF assay seemed to be sensitive, specific, and comparable to nested PCR for identifying MTB among clinically suspected TB patients, and the assay can be valuable in giving a timely identification of resistance to rifampin.

Failure to accurately identify cases of active MTB has serious effects on both patients and the community. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear has poor sensitivity and culture methods have a delay ranging from 1 to 8 weeks for diagnosis. Nucleic acid amplification assays may be suitable candidates for this purpose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, we evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in 190 patients with pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis whom were admitted to Tehran Imam Khomeini hospitals during 2006-2010. Three ml citrated blood samples were obtained from cases. DNA extraction was performed by QIAGEN commercial kit and PCR performed with IS1081 Primer. RESULTS: Fifty six cases had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and 134 were pulmonary. Overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 41.1% and 95.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MTB-PCR assay on PBMC using IS1081 primer has a low sensitivity and now can not use as a single or alternative diagnostic test for tuberculosis. However, with regard to its high specificity can use for help diagnosing of TB in cases have no enough sputum (or other specimens) to examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture."

Study Design: Observational study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from January 2001 to December 2010. Methodology: Different clinical specimens received for Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR were dealt during the study period. Contaminated samples like sputum were processed by the standard N-acetyl L-cysteine (NALC)-NaOH method. PCR protocols were followed as per manufacturer's manual. PCR was performed using a Thermal Cycler (Master Cycler, Eppendorf, Germany): an initial denaturation step at 94C for 3 minutes was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94C for 30 seconds, annealing at 60C for 30 seconds and extension at 72C for 30 seconds and a final extension at 72C for 7 minutes. The products were held at 4C and later run on 1% agarose gel, stained with Ethidium bromide and visualized in ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator. Results: Out of a total 4620 samples for PCR, 299 were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6.5%). The percentage of samples from male patients were 63.2%. The mean age of patients was 38+11.5 years. Blood was the most frequent specimen received for PCR (46.66%), followed by body fluids (18.41%) and CSF (10.64%). Yield for different clinical samples was 63/471 for sputum (13.4%), 3/29 for endobronchial washings (10.3%), 59/851 for body fluids (6.9%) and 24/400 for urine (6%). Positive yield from blood was the lowest (101/2156, 4.7%). Conclusion: PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The highest positive yield was obtained from sputum and lowest from blood specimens."

Diagnosis can be done by imaging techniques, direct visualization by endoscopy, serology, histopathology, culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Laparoscopy detects macroscopic changes only; histology is only suggestive and not confirmatory unless acid fast bacilli (AFB) are demonstrated in the lesion but sensitivity is poor in paucibacillary disease. Culture methods are the gold standard but slow growth of most pathogenic mycobacteria delays the diagnosis. PCR can rapidly detect even few copies of DNA with high sensitivity and specificity. Aim: Comparative evaluation of AFB smear examination, culture in Middlebrook 7H9 media and IS6110 based real-time PCR assay for the detection of mycobacteria in various female genital samples. Materials and methods: A total of 555 female genital samples like endometrial and fallopian tube biopsies, menstrual blood and vaginal discharge were processed by modified Petroff's method. The deposit was used for detection of mycobacteria by AFB smear, culture on Middlebrook 7H9 media and IS6110 based real-time PCR. Results: Out of 555 samples, 25.22% (140/555) were positive by the combination of all the methods used. Overall positivity by real-time PCR alone was 23.78% (132/555), by culture 8.28% (46/555) and 2.70% (15/555) by AFB smear examination. Out of total positives, 94.28% (132/140) were positive by PCR alone, 32.85% (46/140) by culture and 10.71% (15/140) by AFB smear. Eight (5.71%) culture positive samples were negative by smear and PCR, six of these were nontubercular mycobacteria (NTM) and two samples had PCR inhibitors as confirmed by spiking with positive DNA. Contamination was observed in 25/555 (4.5%) which were reported negative by culture but three of these were PCR positive. AFB smear results were available in 1 hour, PCR in 1 day and culture in 4 to 6 weeks. Conclusion: PCR was found to be the most rapid and sensitive (94.28%) method, 9-fold more sensitive than smear examination and 3-fold than the culture for detection of mycobacteria. Results were available in 4 to 6 weeks time for culture but in only 1 day by PCR. IS6110 PCR can detect only MTB and not the NTM. Use of multiplex PCR with genus and MTB specific primers will increase the sensitivity of test but care needs to be taken to prevent false positivity due to cross contamination and false negative due to PCR inhibitors."

Methods:A study was designed to assess the diagnostic value of PCR targeted to IS 1081 in peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals because of ease of obtaining periodic samples. A cohort of 129 individuals was recruited for this purpose. It contained of adult, non-pregnant HIV sero-positive as well as HIV sero-negative individuals who were nave to anti-Koch's treatment at two teaching hospitals in Mumbai. Results: The cohort of 129 individuals was categorized into 5 groups based on their clinical TB and HIV status. The mean CD4 count for TB+HIV+(Groups 1,2,3) ranged between 381 and 525 cells/cmm suggesting early to moderate immune suppression.TB PCR assay was compared with the 'gold' standard, namely the LJ culture in each of the 5 groups. Overall, the sensitivity of PCR was 83.3% and specificity was 97.1%. PCR+ LJ-were subjected to sequential TB PCR tests at intervals of two weeks after initiation of AKT.TB PCR+ patients converted to TB PCR negative between 6-8 weeks. Conclusions: The study established that PCR targeted to IS 1081 is a valuable test for early diagnosis of TB from peripheral blood at an early point of TB activation when most patients (>85%) did not produce other traditional specimens such as the sputum and/or pleural fluid.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a benzyl-alcohol g uanidine hydrochloride (DNA extraction) method (GuHClM) on blood samples. DESIGN: GuHClM was evaluated in quantitatively spiked blood samples with M. tuberculosis. We assessed the insertion sequence (IS) 6110 region of M. tuberculosis to evaluate the efficacy of the method. The method was also applied on 102 clinical samples of suspected tuberculosis (TB) individuals and compared with smear microscopy of sputum specimens and the results of cultures. RESULTS: This method reproducibly detected as low as 4-6 bacilli. Of 102 clinical samples, 84 were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative, while 18 were HIV-positive. Among the HIV-negative individuals, 58.3% were TB-positive using PCR, while respectively 47.6% and 45.2% were sputum- and culture-positive. Among the HIV-positive individuals, 55.6% were PCR-positive, whereas only 38.9% were sputum-positive and 50% were culture-positive. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the identification of mycobacteria by PCR using GuHClM is very sensitive and therefore may have wide utility in the diagnosis of TB.  2010 The Union."

In 1993, the World Health Organization declared tuberculosis a global public health emergency. Conventional methods for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections are time consuming, as MTB culture requires 3-8 weeks for growth. To determine the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), we have evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in adults with new cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. Setting: Department of Infectious disease of Imam Khomeini Hospital, 2004-2005, Tehran, Iran. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated MTB DNA extracted from 3ml citrated peripheral blood samples from 95 adults with new cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. DNA extraction was performed using a commercial PCR kit with IS1081 primers. For prevention of cross contamination and reduction of false positives, all steps were performed under laminar hood. Results: The 95 patients, 59 of whom were male, had a mean age 44.44 years (SD20.26); 69 cases had pulmonary and 26 had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. PCR was positive in 32 (33.7%) patients and negative in 63 (66.3%) cases. The overall sensitivity and accuracy of the PCR assay was 44.1% for pulmonary, 19.2% for extra-pulmonary and 10% for disseminated tuberculosis, respectively. Conclusion: The low sensitivity of the IS1081 primer MTB-PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, further studies are needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis."

We simultaneously detected anti-mycobacterium bovis BCG IgG secreting cells in both cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood (PBL) by enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT), repeated insertion sequence IS6110 specific for mycobacterium tuberculosis in CSF by PCR and anti-BCG IgG titre in both CSF and PBL by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The sensitivity of ELISPOT was 84.0%, much higher than that of PCR (75.0%) and ELISA (52.3%). The specificities of the three tests were 91.8%, 93.7% and 91.8% respectively. The numbers of CSF cells secreting anti-BCG IgG tested by ELISPOT were even higher in the early phase of TBM, but declined along with the disease progressing (t = -3.183, P = 0.008), which allowed an early diagnosis to be made. Conclusion: ELISPOT technique is proved to be the most valuable test for the early diagnosis of TBM."

A specificity of 100% was achieved with DNA amplification methods and tradicional culture/identification methods, in relation to clinical findings and treatment results. For the smear-negative sputa, conventional PCR for M. tuberculosis was positive in 62% of suspected lung TB case, showing the same sensitivity as bacterial identification. Both techniques failed in the detection of extra-pulmonary samples. Nested PCR showed, after species-specific amplification, a sensitivity of 100% for M. avium and 85% for M. tuberculosis. For extra-pulmonary smear-negative samples, only Nested PCR detected M. tuberculosis and all cases were confirmed clinically. Nested PCR, in which two-step amplification reactions are performed, can identify the two most important mycobacteria in human pathology quickly and directly from clinical spicimens."

In the present study a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test based on DNA sequence coding for a 38-kilodalton protein antigen b (Pab), specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was compared with Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained AFB (acid fast bacilli) smear examination, culture based on conventional Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium and radiometric BACTEC 460 system for the diagnosis of TB using clinical samples obtained from pulmonary and extra-pulmonary cases of TB. Methods: Clinical samples obtained from 168 patients of suspected TB (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) were subjected to ZN smear examination, LJ culture, radiometric BACTEC culture and a PCR test by amplifying 419bp sequence coding for Pab, a glycoprotein of molecular weight 38 kDa. Results: A significant difference was seen in the sensitivity of different tests, the figures being 74.2 per cent for PCR test, 53.4 per cent for BACTEC culture, 47.1 per cent for LJ medium based culture and 35.2 per cent for ZN smear examination (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between different tests as far as specificity was concerned. PCR test sensitivity in pulmonary and extra-pulmonary clinical samples were 74.3 and 71.5 per cent respectively, being significantly higher (P<0.05) when compared with sensitivity of other tests. The mean detection time for M. tuberculosis was 24.0 days by LJ media culture, 12.8 days by BACTEC culture and less than 1 day by smear examination and PCR test. Interpretation & conclusion: PCR test is more sensitive than ZN smear examination, LJ medium culture and BACTEC culture for diagnosing TB in pulmonary and extra-pulmonary clinical samples."

By using nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, one may be able to diagnose, the disease on the day of arrival of specimen in the laboratory. For diagnosis of tuberculosis by direct methods like PCR, specimens from site of infection are required. In certain cases it is difficult to get the specimens from site of infection and in such situations; some researchers have tried to detect the DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from blood of these patients. The purposive of this study is to determine the diagnostic efficacy of peripheral blood-based polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: This was a simple descriptive study, carried out in Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi from Jan 2004 to Dec 2004. Sputum and blood samples were collected from 96 suspected patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum samples processed for ZN staining and AFB culture (gold standard) and blood samples processed for PCR. RESULTS: Out of 96 cases, 60 (62.5%) were culture positive. PCR was positive in 14 (14.5%). AFB smear positive were 34 (35.4%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 20% and 94.4% respectively and the positive and negative predictive values were 85.71% and 41.46% respectively. The overall efficiency of the test was 47.91%. CONCLUSION: Due to low sensitivity; a negative PCR assay does not rule the disease. However, this test may be helpful in cases where specimens from the site of infection are not available."

Among 17 clinically suspected pulmonary tuberculosis patient's (M:F 65:35) sputum samples, 12 were found positive by both primers. Among 81 routine samples (sputum=12; blood=27; cerebrospinal fluid=16; ascitic fluid=12 and urine=14), 12 were found to be positive by IS6110 primer while 13 were found positive by MPB64. The result of M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in sputum, ascitic fluid, CSF and urine samples were found to be similar in both the primers used. It is suggested that, M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in blood samples using MPB64 primers sometime gives false positive result and therefore, may not be recommended for blood samples. As in other samples both the primers gave almost the same result and therefore, both the primers can be used for MTB DNA PCR vice versa in order to cross check if one gives dubious result."

The inadequate sensitivity of Ziehl-Neelsen staining and its inability to distinguish atypical mycobacteria delays accurate diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of TB in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blood and extra-pulmonary samples from patients with AIDS and pulmonary infiltrates. DESIGN: Specimens from 103 HIV-1-infected patients were prospectively analysed using bacteriological methods and IS6110-PCR. Smear-positive samples were also tested using 16S ribosomal-DNA-PCR to identify Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. Gold standard diagnosis relied on positive cultures or treatment outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients exhibited TB, one TB and MAC and four MAC. The sensitivity of IS6110-PCR was 100% in smear-positive samples, 81.8% in smear-negative BAL, 66.7% in extra-pulmonary samples and 42.9% in blood. Its specificity was 97.1% in BAL and 100% in extra-pulmonary and blood specimens. The 16S rDNA-PCR identified M. avium from all smear-positive samples that grew MAC. CONCLUSIONS: IS6110-PCR proved useful in evaluating episodes with probable clinical diagnosis of pulmonary or mixed TB and negative smears, whereas 16S rDNA-PCR would be helpful for prompt differential diagnosis of MAC in smear-positive specimens."

The authors report the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA in specimens from six patients using a nested PCR protocol specific for IS6110 insertion element of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Three men and three women are reported with ages ranging from 42 to 68 years. The sites of infection were the knee and shoulder in one case each, the hip in two cases, and the thoracic spine in two cases. Diagnosis was established within three days, and treatment was initiated promptly.

Here we describe a simple method for the isolation of PCR-amplifiable DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from all types of samples of pulmonary and extrapulmonary origin tested. Briefly, it involves concentration of the bacilli by high-speed centrifugation, removal of PCR inhibitors by a wash solution containing guanidinium isothiocyanate and the release of bacterial DNA by heating in the presence of detergents and Chelex-100 resin. The entire process is accomplished within 3 h.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical relevance of detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. DESIGN: Single-centre prospective case study of 90 hospitalised patients and 50 healthy subjects or blood donors from 1 January to 30 June 1998. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis (26.7%); 20 tuberculosis patients were culture-positive, with seven smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli. Sensitivity of smear, culture and nested PCR was 30.4 (7/23), 87 (20/23) and 30.4% (7/23), respectively. The specificity of smear and culture was 100%, and the specificity of the nested PCR was 96% in the healthy subjects. However, the specificity decreased to 83.6% in the hospitalised patients, with 11 nested PCR-positive patients without a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The sensitivity of the nested PCR was low in pulmonary tuberculosis (22.2%), but increased in pulmonary/extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (50%), extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (33%), and disseminated tuberculosis (33%). CONCLUSION: The use of a nested PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis with regard to low sensitivity and specificity. However, further studies are needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of paucibacillary forms of tuberculosis."

In general there was an agreement between the results of PCR and clinical diagnosis for tuberculosis. In the case of sputum samples it was possible to compare the PCR and culture results. When considering all the sputum samples analysed, in general the PCR was slightly less sensitive than the culture test. However, when applied to the analysis of samples from patients suspected of tuberculosis, six samples that were culture negative were positive by PCR. Considering the confirmed results of all clinical samples analysed, the sensitivity of the method described in this work (97.4%) was much higher than culture test (45.5%). This difference was mainly due to the low sensitivity of culture test in cerebrospinal fluid, serum and blood samples. The results presented in this work indicate that the inclusion of the glass matrix step in the preparation of DNA improves the detection of M. tuberculosis in clinical samples."

There is a need for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. We have previously used a PCR to detect circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in blood samples from patients (mostly HIV-infected) with pulmonary tuberculosis. We have now prospectively investigated the role of this blood-based PCR assay for diagnosis of this disease in a clinical setting. Methods. Our PCR assay is specific for the IS6110 insertion element of the M tuberculosis complex of organisms. We from ward pulmonary tuberculosis. Personnel who carried out the assay did not know the results of any clinical investigations and ultimate diagnosis, and clinicians did not know the PCR results. Results of the PCR assay were compared with the final clinical diagnosis. A subgroup of 15 patients had blood samples assayed serially to track the PCR signal over time. Findings. 41 patients had a final clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis, and the cases were typical of those seen at our hospital: HIV infection was common, and most cases were not sputum-smear positive for acid-fast bacilli. The PCR assay correctly identified 39 of 41 patients with proven pulmonary tuberculosis, 26 (63%) of whom were sputum-smear negative. There were five patients in whom a positive PCR result did not accord with the final clinical diagnosis, and two of the 44 negative PCR results were classified as false negatives. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay for a diagnosis of tuberculosis was 95% and 89%, respectively. In 15 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and a positive blood assay, the PCR result remained positive after 1 month of therapy, but had reverted to negative in 13 of the 15 by 4 months of therapy. Interpretation. We conclude that peripheral-blood-based PCR detection for the diagnosis of tuberculosis Is a technically feasible approach that has a potentially important role in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis."

All smear positive samples were PCR positive except for 7/138 (5.07%) that were false negative because of the presence of inhibitors. However, the use of several samples for each patient minimize the false negative results. The PCR allowed the detection of more positive results in smear negative sputa from HIV- (50%) than in HIV+ patients (20.5%). In contrast, in smear negative blood samples, PCR was positive more frequently in HIV+ (30%) than in HIV- patients (12.5%). Regarding patients, 15/25 HIV+ and 13/17 HIV-patients had at least one positive sample with PCR whereas only 7/25 and 11/17 respectively for HIV+ and HIV- patients had smear positive samples. Thus with some technical cares, PCR might be a useful tool for rapid diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection in smear negative samples particularly in HIV+ patients."
