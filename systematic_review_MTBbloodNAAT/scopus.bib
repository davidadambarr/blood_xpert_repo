abstract={Background: Paratuberculosis and tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), respectively are economically important, chronic debilitating diseases affecting the dairy herds and are also potential zoonotic threats. Aims: Differential diagnosis of paratuberculosis and TB in blood samples of cattle and buffaloes. Methods: In this study, an in-house developed multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting MAP, Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium smegmatis was used in blood samples (buffy coat) parallel with IS900 PCR and esxB PCR for diagnosis of paratuberculosis and TB, respectively; in a total of 202 cattle and buffaloes. Results: Out of 202 animals, 12 (5.9%) and 17 (8.4%) animals were positive for MAP by multiplex PCR and IS900 PCR, respectively; from which only 8 (4%) animals were positive by both tests; whereas 4 and 9 animals were exclusively positive by multiplex PCR and IS900 PCR, respectively. None of the animals were found to be positive for M. bovis and M. smegmatis by the multiplex PCR. However, the esxB PCR detected 13 (6.4%) animals positive for TB. In fact, 3 (1.5%) animals were found to be co-infected by both paratuberculosis and TB. Conclusion: The in-house multiplex PCR detected MAP in buffy coat and there was a fair degree of agreement between the multiplex PCR and IS900 PCR in detection of MAP DNA though the latter detected more number of animals to be positive for MAP. Besides, esxB PCR showed a high diagnostic potential and can be used for diagnosis of TB from blood. © 2020 Shiraz University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Improved tuberculosis diagnostics and tools for monitoring treatment response are urgently needed. We developed a robust and simple, PCR-based host-blood transcriptomic signature, RISK6, for multiple applications: identifying individuals at risk of incident disease, as a screening test for subclinical or clinical tuberculosis, and for monitoring tuberculosis treatment. RISK6 utility was validated by blind prediction using quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR in seven independent cohorts. Prognostic performance significantly exceeded that of previous signatures discovered in the same cohort. Performance for diagnosing subclinical and clinical disease in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected persons, assessed by area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, exceeded 85%. As a screening test for tuberculosis, the sensitivity at 90% specificity met or approached the benchmarks set out in World Health Organization target product profiles for non-sputum-based tests. RISK6 scores correlated with lung immunopathology activity, measured by positron emission tomography, and tracked treatment response, demonstrating utility as treatment response biomarker, while predicting treatment failure prior to treatment initiation. Performance of the test in capillary blood samples collected by finger-prick was noninferior to venous blood collected in PAXgene tubes. These results support incorporation of RISK6 into rapid, capillary blood-based point-of-care PCR devices for prospective assessment in field studies. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) testing in cattle requires a significant investment of time, equipment, and labor. Novel, rapid, cheaper and accurate methods are needed. The Alere Determine TB lipoarabinomannan antigen (LAM-test) is a World Health Organization-endorsed point-of-care urine test designed to detect active TB disease in humans. The Lionex Animal TB Rapid Test (Lionex-test) is a novel animal specific TB diagnostic blood test. An animal level analysis was performed using urine (n = 141) and milk (n = 63) samples from depopulated BTB-suspected cattle to test the accuracy of the LAM-test when compared to results of positive TB detection by any routine BTB tests (BOVIGAM, necropsy, histology, culture, PCR) that are regularly performed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The agreement between the urine LAM-test and USDA standard tests were poor at varying testing time points. The same milk samples did not elicit statistically significant agreement with the Lionex-test, although positive trends were present. Hence, we cannot recommend the LAM-test as a valid BTB diagnostic test in cattle using either urine or milk. The Lionex-test’s production of positive trends using milk samples suggests larger sample sizes may validate the Lionex-test in accurately diagnosing BTB in cattle using milk samples, potentially providing a quick and reliable field test for BTB. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM) may impede immune responses in tuberculosis (TB) and thus contribute to enhanced disease severity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate DM-mediated alterations in clinical, radiological and immunological outcomes in TB disease. Methods: Newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients with or without DM (TB n = 40; TB-DM n = 40) were recruited in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Clinical symptoms, sputum smear and culture conversion as well as chest radiography were assessed. Peripheral blood and sputum samples were collected at the time of diagnosis (baseline) and after 1, 2 and 6 months of standard anti-TB treatment. Blood samples were also obtained from healthy controls (n = 20). mRNA expression of inflammatory markers in blood and sputum samples were quantified using real-time PCR. Results: The majority of TB-DM patients had poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 8%) and displayed elevated pulmonary pathology (P = 0.039) particularly in the middle (P < 0.004) and lower lung zones (P < 0.02) throughout the treatment period. However, reduction of clinical symptoms and time to sputum smear and culture conversion did not differ between the groups. Transcripts levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β (P = 0.003 at month-1 and P = 0.045 at month-2) and TNF-α (P = 0.005 at month-1) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (P = 0.005 at month-2) were higher in peripheral blood after anti-TB treatment in TB-DM compared to TB patients. Conversely in sputum, TB-DM patients had reduced CD4 (P < 0.009 at month-1) and IL-10 (P = 0.005 at month-1 and P = 0.006 at month-2) transcripts, whereas CD8 was elevated (P = 0.016 at month-2). At 1- and 2-month post-treatment, sputum IL-10 transcripts were inversely correlated with fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels in all patients. Conclusion: Insufficient up-regulation of IL-10 in the lung may fuel persistent local inflammation thereby promoting lung pathology in TB-DM patients with poorly controlled DM. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={We developed a chemiluminescence immunoassay method based on the recombinant nucleocapsid antigen and assessed its performance for the clinical diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infections by detecting SARS-CoV-2–specific IgM and IgG antibodies in patients. Full-length recombinant nucleocapsid antigen and tosyl magnetic beads were used to develop the chemiluminescence immunoassay approach. Plasmas from 29 healthy cohorts, 51 tuberculosis patients, and 79 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients were employed to evaluate the chemiluminescence immunoassay method performance for the clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. A commercial ELISA kit (Darui Biotech, China) using the same nucleocapsid antigen was used for the in-parallel comparison with our chemiluminescence immunoassay method. The IgM and IgG manner of testing in the chemiluminescence immunoassay method showed a sensitivity and specificity of 60.76% (95% CI 49.1 to 71.6) and 92.25% (95% CI 83.4 to 97.2) and 82.28% (95% CI 72.1 to 90.0) and 97.5% (95% CI 91.3 to 99.7), respectively. Higher sensitivity and specificity were observed in the chemiluminescence immunoassay method compared with the Darui Biotech ELISA kit. The developed high sensitivity and specificity chemiluminescence immunoassay IgG testing method combined with the RT-PCR approach can improve the clinical diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infections and thus contribute to the control of COVID-19 expansion. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={AIM: To determine the spectrum of uveitis, causes of visual loss in systemic tuberculosis (TB), role of investigations and outcome after anti-TB therapy (ATT). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 250 patients with systemic TB at a referral center in Chennai, South India from April 2016 to May 2019. Systemic workup comprised of Mantoux, chest X-ray, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and QuantiFERON (QFT) TB Gold. Aqueous humor analysis by nested PCR or real time PCR (RT-PCR) and ancillary ophthalmic investigations such as fundus fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography were performed. RESULTS: Multifocal choroiditis and vasculitis were the most common manifestations (39% and 24% respectively) together accounting for 61% of cases and they had a higher risk of recurrence (3%). Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) was more frequently associated with uveitis (18%). Among those with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), uveitis occured in miliary TB (2%), bone (1%) and abdominal TB (1%). Complications such as cystoid macular edema, choroidal neovascular membranes and macular scarring caused visual loss. Aqueous humor analysis detected mycobacterium TB antigen. Collectively, systemic investigations such as chest X-ray, Mantoux test and those performed on blood samples such as PCR and QFT were positive in 39% of patients. In inconclusive patients, nested PCR and/or RT-PCR were done on aqueous humor samples and were diagnostic in 96%. A combination of tests was diagnostic in 92%. ATT in isolation in 71% and combined with corticosteroids in 29% was used for treatment of which signs of resolution and improvement in vision started as early as 6wk in those who were started immediately on corticosteroids and ATT and longer than 3mo in those on ATT alone. Prompt treatment with ATT and corticosteroids improved vision in 23% of our patients within 2mo. Vitritis with choroiditis causes cystoid macular oedema and requires longer duration of ATT. Vision improved in 69%. Complete resolution occurred in 75% and worsening in 12%. CONCLUSION: A combination of investigations guided by clinical suspicion helps in precise diagnosis. In diagnostic dilemmas analysis of ocular samples is reliable and confirmatory. Screening all patients and a multidisciplinary approach in TB (active, healed or during treatment) is recommended. © 2020 International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office).

abstract={Major challenges still exist in the accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis in children. Algorithms based on clinical and radiological features remain in widespread use despite poor performance. Newer molecular diagnostics allow for rapid identification of TB and detection of drug-resistance in a subset of children, but lack sensitivity. Molecular testing of multiple specimens, including non-traditional specimen types, such as nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool and urine, may improve sensitivity, but the optimal combination of specimens requires further research. Novel tests under development or evaluation include a urine lipoarabinomannan test with improved sensitivity and a range of biomarkers measured from stimulated or unstimulated peripheral blood. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Objective(s): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a widespread infectious disease around the world. Early diagnosis is always important in order to avoid spreading. At present, many studies have confirmed that microRNA (miRNA) could be a useful tool for diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate whether miRNAs could be regarded as a noninvasive diagnosis biomarker from sputum for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Materials and Methods: The M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv was incubated and cultured with human macrophage line THP-1. The total RNA was extracted from the THP-1 cells for detection. Six increased expressions of miRNAs were selected by miRNA microarray chips and the miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR in the M. tuberculosis infection cell model. At last, the efficiency of other methods was compared with using miRNA. Results:OnlymiR-155showedabetterdiagnosticvalueforPTBthantheotherfivemiRNAstodistinguish PTB from non-PTB, including pneumonia, lung cancer, and unexplained pulmonary nodules. Next, we detected and analyzed the results of 68 PTB patients and 122 non-PTB, the sensitivity and specificity of miR-155 detection was 94.1% and 87.7%, respectively. It was higher than sputum smear detection and anti-TB antibody detection. But slightly lower than ELISpot (97%, P=0.404). Interestingly, the ranking of sputum smear by Ziehl-Neelsen staining had positive correlation with the expression level of miR-155 in smear-positive sputum (R2=0.8443, P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Our research suggested that miR-155 may be an efficiency biomarker for active PTB diagnosis and bacteria-loads evaluation. © 2020 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

abstract={Background: In this study, we aimed to assess mRNA expressions of visfatin and lipocalin-2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Methods: Overall, 79 PTB patients and 71 healthy controls were enrolled. In PBMCs, mRNA expressions of visfatin and lipocalin-2 were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the diagnostic value of these adipokine mRNAs in PTB patients was calculated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: In PBMCs from PTB patients, the visfatin mRNA level was significantly higher than in healthy controls (P <.001), with no significant association between the lipocalin-2 mRNA level and PTB patients (P =.933). In PTB patients, lipocalin-2 mRNA expression positively correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P =.010). However, the visfatin mRNA level was not associated with any major clinical and laboratory parameter in PTB patients. The ROC curve demonstrated that visfatin could help distinguish PTB patients from healthy controls, with an optimal cutoff value of 0.645 and a corresponding sensitivity of 79.7%. Conclusions: The altered visfatin mRNA expression indicated that this adipokine might play a role in PTB and could be an auxiliary biomarker for PTB diagnosis. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular protozoan parasite, can induce various clinical symptoms. T. gondii has been considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. This survey was conducted to explore the correlation between T. gondii infection and lung diseases through a case-control study carried out in Shandong province, eastern China. In the present survey, T. gondii IgG antibodies were found in 76/398 (19.10%) of patients with lung diseases, which was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the level found in the control subjects (35/398; 8.79%) through serological diagnosis. Patients with lung cancer have the highest T. gondii seroprevalence (26.19%), followed by Pulmonary cyst (25.00%), Tuberculosis (17.07%), Pneumonia (16.33%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (16.05%). Moreover, a semi-nest PCR targeted T. gondii B1 gene was employed to detect the T. gondii DNA in the blood samples. T. gondii DNA was detected in 5.53% blood samples of patients with lung diseases and 2.51% control subjects, respectively. The present study firstly shows that T. gondii has a high probability to infect the patients with lung diseases. Thus, the potential presence of T. gondii in patients with lung diseases should be appreciated during in the course of treatment and safeguard procedures should be implemented to protect vulnerable patients with lung diseases. © 2020},

abstract={Purpose of Review: Neurological conditions associated with HIV/AIDS including central nervous system (CNS), opportunistic infections (OI), chronic conditions including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral escape remain major contributors to morbidity and mortality worldwide. CNS infections in HIV-infected patients are often challenging to diagnose by traditional microbiological testing, impacting treatment and outcome. Recent Findings: Recent advances in diagnostic techniques, including metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), are changing the landscape of microbiological testing, mainly in resource-rich settings. Pathogen discovery techniques offer a hypothesis-free approach to diagnostic testing, yielding comprehensive analysis of microbial genetic material. Given the extent of genetic material produced, deep sequencing tools not only hold promise in the diagnosis of CNS infections but also in defining key pathogenic steps which have previously been unanswered. Summary: Significant challenges remain to implementing pathogen discovery techniques in routine clinical practice including cost, expertise and infrastructure needed including laboratory and bioinformatics support, and sample contamination risk. The use in resource-limited regions where the burden of CNS complications due to HIV/AIDS is highest remains poorly defined. Though, major opportunities utilizing pathogen discovery techniques exist to enhance surveillance and diagnosis and improve our understanding of mechanisms of neuroinvasion in CNS conditions associated with HIV. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs) are increasingly used to test for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Although highly specific, IGRAs have a relatively high false-negative rate in active TB patients. A more sensitive assay is needed. IFN-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10) is an alternative biomarker with a 100-fold-higher expression level than IFN-γ, allowing for different analysis platforms, including molecular detection. The PCR technique is already an integrated tool in most TB laboratories and, thus, an obvious platform to turn to. In this case-control study, we investigated the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a molecular assay detecting IP-10 mRNA expression following antigen stimulation of a blood sample. We included 89 TB patients and 99 healthy controls. Blood was drawn in QuantiFeron-TB gold in-tube (QFT) assay tubes. Eight hours poststimulation, IP-10 mRNA expression was analyzed, and 20 h poststimulation, IP-10 and IFN-γ protein plasma levels were analyzed using an in-house IP-10 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the official QFT ELISA, respectively. The IP-10 mRNA assay provided high specificity (98%), sensitivity (80%), and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) (0.97); however, the QFT assay provided a higher overall diagnostic potential, with specificity of 100%, sensitivity of 90%, and AUC of 0.99. The IP-10 protein assay performed on par with the QFT assay, with specificity of 98%, sensitivity of 87%, and AUC of 0.98. We have provided proof of high technical performance of a molecular assay detecting IP-10 mRNA expression. As a diagnostic tool, this assay would gain from further optimization, especially on the kinetics of IP-10 mRNA expression. Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Background: Tuberculosis is still a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge with high proportion of smear- and culture- negative incidences worldwide. The conventional diagnostic tests are time-consuming and have a low sensitivity. Digital PCR is a novel technology which can detect target sequences with relatively low abundance and obtain the absolute copy numbers of the targets. Methods: We assessed the accuracy of dPCR in TB diagnosis using more than 250 specimens, and for the first time, we selected M.tuberculosis-specific IS1081 in addition to widely used IS6110 as the amplification targets for dPCR. The quantification of target DNA was calculated using QuantaSoft Version 1.7.4.0917 (BioRad), and SPSS version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Results: IS6110-dPCR was more sensitive than IS1081, with the sensitivity and specificity accounting for 40.6 and 93.4% respectively. When we classified the TB patients by personal factors for high copy number of M.tuberculosis derived DNA in plasma: bilateral TB, extrapulmonary TB and disseminated TB, the sensitivity of both IS6110- and IS1081- dPCR was the highest in patients with disseminated TB (IS6110, 100%; IS1081, 68.8%), while their sensitivity was a bit higher in patients with extrapulmonary TB (IS6110, 50.0%; IS1081, 39.3%) than that in bilateral TB (IS6110, 43.3%; IS1081, 33.3%). Compared with traditional TB diagnostic tests, joint detection IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR was not as sensitive as smear microscope or mycobacterial culture, but it was higher than IS6110 qPCR (p < 0.05) and was able to detect 47.4% of smear-negative TB patients. Conclusion: Our study suggested that plasma IS6110-dPCR is a rapid, moderate accurate and less-invasive method to detect M.tuberculosis DNA in plasma of TB patients and IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR has a potential to aid diagnosis of smear-negative TB. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: To investigate the expression levels of miRNA-29a (miR-29a), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in peripheral blood of pulmonary tuberculosis patients and their correlation with clinical and pathological features. Methods: A prospective analysis was performed on 192 pulmonary tuberculosis patients (pulmonary tuberculosis group) and 186 healthy patients (control group) who were admitted to Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China from Jun 2015 to Jun 2019. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression levels of miR-29a, and ELISA to detect the concentrations of TNF-α and VEGF in serum. The diagnostic value of miR-29a, TNF-α and VEGF in tuberculosis was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The correlation of the expression levels of miR-29a, TNF-α and VEGF with gender, age, low-grade fever, expectoration, hemoptysis and pulmonary tuberculosis classification was analyzed. Results: The expression levels of miR-29a, TNF-α and VEGF in pulmonary tuberculosis group were significantly higher than those in control group (P<0.001). The area under curves of miR-29a, TNF-α, and VEGF were 0.818, 0.743, and 0.805, respectively. miR-29a was closely correlated with low-grade fever, expectoration, hemoptysis and pulmonary tuberculosis classification (P<0.050). TNF-α and VEGF were closely correlated with patient age, low-grade fever, expectoration, hemoptysis and pulmonary tuberculosis classification (P<0.050). Conclusion: Highly expressed in pulmonary tuberculosis patients, TNF-α and VEGF are closely correlated with the disease progression of patients, expected to become targets for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in the future. © 2020, Iranian Journal of Public Health.

abstract={OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the comparative performance of different assays used in a Diagnostic Laboratory Hub that linked 13 HIV healthcare facilities for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis, and describing its functions in Guatemala compared with other National Reference Laboratories. METHODS: The following diagnostic techniques were analyzed in 24 months (2017-2018) in a cohort of patients with HIV: smear microscopy, mycobacterial and fungal cultures, isolator blood culture, PCR assays, and antigen detection tests. RESULTS: A total of 4245 patients were included, 716 (16.2%) had an opportunistic infection: 249 (34.7%) TB, 40 (5.6%) nontuberculous mycobacteria, 227 (31.7%) histoplasmosis, 138 (19.3%) cryptococcosis, and 62 (8.6%) had multiple opportunistic infections. Two hundred sixty-three [92.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 89-95.1] of TB cases were diagnosed by PCR. Urine antigen assay detected 94% (95% CI, 89-96) of the disseminated histoplasmosis cases. A lateral flow assay to detect cryptococcal antigen diagnosed 97% (95% CI, 93.3-98.7%) of the cryptococcal cases. In 85 patients (51.5%) with a cerobrospinal fluid sample, cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed in 55 (64.7%), of which 18 (32.7%) were only detected by cryptococcal antigen. CONCLUSION: Validated commercial antigen tests, as used in this program, should be the new gold standard for histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis diagnosis. In their absence, 35% of disseminated histoplasmosis and 32.7% of cryptococcal meningitis cases would have been missed. Patients with multiple opportunistic infections were frequently diagnosed and strategies should be designed to screen patients irrespective of their clinical presentation. In low resource settings, Diagnostic Laboratory Hubs can deliver quality diagnostics services in record time at affordable prices.},

abstract={Mycobacteriosis caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium was observed in a parental loft of 70 meat-breed pigeons. It was decided to undertake treatment as the birds represented a substantial value to the owner. A multiagent therapy using azithromycin, marbofloxacin, and ethambutol was administered. After 4 mo of therapy, the desired results were not obtained. At the end of treatment, the birds were in poor general condition, with white blood cells above 20 g/L, and after clutching, 2-yr-old and older birds were euthanatized. Overall, postmortem lesions were found in 17 out of 49 necropsied individuals. Slide agglutination tests with a M. avium subsp. avium lysate were conducted in all examined pigeons. In 28 pigeons, blood count was conducted once a month during therapy, while in 24 pigeons, a tuberculin sensitivity test was conducted before the planned euthanatization. The tuberculin sensitivity test did not prove useful in the diagnosis of ill individuals. Slide agglutination yielded positive results in only four birds, all of which also had postmortem lesions. Blood count in a large number of cases allowed distinguishing between ill and healthy individuals, which was used for subsequent selection. The comparison of cultured strains with the (CCG)4-based PCR method showed the variation of M. avium isolates up to a maximum of 30%. The described case proves that the treatment of mycobacteriosis in pigeon flocks is not effective, mainly due to the high resistance to M. avium subsp. avium. In addition, therapy may contribute to an even greater increase in mycobacterial resistance to antibiotics, which may pose a potential risk to public health. © 2020 American Association of Avian Pathologists.

abstract={Chagas disease (ChD) is a parasitosis caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc). It is endemic to almost all Latin American countries, including the southern United States. The acute form of ChD and its actual incidence have rarely been described in Mexico, despite the extensive presence of favorable niches for its transmission. The objective of this study was to estimate the frequency of acute ChD in febrile patients at the central Pacific coast of Mexico. For this, we surveyed patients with persistent fever (5 to 10 days) in five hospitals at the Mexican states of Jalisco, Colima, and Nayarit in 2012. Samples were taken from a total of 485 patients to detect Tc in blood using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and direct microscopic examination. Of these subjects, 10 were positive for PCR and none for microscopic examination (2% in 12 months). We adjusted this rate by the total people at risk in the area and obtained an incidence of 7.4/100,000 habs./year. The positive cases showed no association with sex, rural settlement, or pet ownership, only with the contact with Triatominae insects (odds ratio = 9.22 and confidence interval: 1.93-44.06). The clinical picture of positive patients showed an association with the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections. Meanwhile, only one fatal case showed the typical picture of acute fatal cardiomyopathy. The pulmonary manifestations of our patients suggest possible lung pathogenicity of Tc, which merits further investigation. Our findings differ markedly from the official reports for ChD. This difference suggests an underestimation of the disease. These findings urge the Mexican health authorities to implement more vigorous actions aimed at improving medical skills in the timely diagnosis of ChD, as well as to apply efficient preventive programs. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.},

abstract={Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of death globally despite curative treatment, partly due to the difficulty of identifying patients who will not respond to therapy. Simple host biomarkers that correlate with response to drug treatment would facilitate improvement in outcomes and the evaluation of novel therapies. In a prospective longitudinal cohort study, we evaluated neutrophil count and phenotype at baseline, as well as during TB treatment in 79 patients [50 (63%) HIV-positive] with microbiologically confirmed drug susceptible TB undergoing standard treatment. At time of diagnosis, blood neutrophils were highly expanded and surface expression of the neutrophil marker CD15 greatly reduced compared to controls. Both measures changed rapidly with the commencement of drug treatment and returned to levels seen in healthy control by treatment completion. Additionally, at the time of diagnosis, high neutrophil count, and low CD15 expression was associated with higher sputum bacterial load and more severe lung damage on chest x-ray, two clinically relevant markers of disease severity. Furthermore, CD15 expression level at diagnosis was associated with TB culture conversion after 2 months of therapy (OR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.89), a standard measure of early TB treatment success. Importantly, our data was not significantly impacted by HIV co-infection. These data suggest that blood neutrophil metrics could potentially be exploited to develop a simple and rapid test to help determine TB disease severity, monitor drug treatment response, and identify subjects at diagnosis who may respond poorly to treatment. © Copyright © 2020 Ndlovu, Peetluk, Moodley, Nhamoyebonde, Ngoepe, Mazibuko, Khan, Karim, Pym, Maruri, Moosa, van der Heijden, Sterling and Leslie.},

abstract={Background: Bacteriological confirmation (BC) proportion among notified pulmonary TB patients in China is among the lowest in the world. This study was to understand the yield of BC using different testing strategies and patient-level factors associated with BC among pulmonary TB patients in Tianjin, China during 2017-2018. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted, enrolling pulmonary TB patients reported to National TB Information Management System (TBIMS) in Tianjin during 2017-2018. BC was defined as a positive result by any of the followings: smear microscopy, culture, or nucleic acid amplification test. Individual characteristics were compared between patients with positive and negative bacteriological results using contingency tables and χ2 test. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to analyze factors associated with BC, calculating adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) (α = 0.05). Results: Of 6364 reported patients, 4181 (65.7%) were bacteriologically confirmed. Positivity proportion was 43.1% (2746/6364) for smear microscopy, 57.7% (3380/5853) for culture, 61.7% (1608/2605) for Xpert® MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) and 73.4% (1824/2484) for combination of the three. The unemployed (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-2.2) and farmers (aOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8) compared with students; diagnosis by inpatient hospitals compared with TB clinics (aOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 2.6-4.4); having symptoms for ≥2 weeks (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8); cough (aOR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.8-2.8); blood sputum (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-2.2); cavitation on chest X-ray (aOR = 3.3, 95% CI: 2.5-4.3); bilateral lung lobes affected (aOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.4-2.2) were factors associated with BC. Conclusions: Combination test was an effective way to improve BC among pulmonary TB patients. Being unemployed, farmers, having prolonged symptoms, and more severe in TB condition were factors associated with BC. We recommend combination of tests to improve BC for pulmonary TB patients, especially who are in early stage of the disease or with conditions tend to be bacteriologically negative. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Tuberculosis is a disease that may affect any organ of the body. Multifocal tuberculosis involving multiple systems with associated symptoms are rare, which makes the diagnosis challenging. Distinguishing multifocal tuberculosis from lesions metastatic from system malignancy is difficult. Single detection method is difficult to make a diagnosis. A combination of multiple methods is essential. Case presentation: A 17-year-old male presented with a 20 days weakness of lower limbs, which aggravated for 6 days. The PET/CT showed increased metabolism of ileocecal intestinal and terminal ileum wall, multiple enlarged lymph node (LNs), multiple osteolytic bone lesions, and soft tissue intensity belong T7 and T8 vertebrae. To confirm the diagnosis of the disease, a biopsy of the mediastinum lymph nodes was carried out. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of the specimen was positive for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the T-SPOT and Xpert MTB/RIF test were also positive, which suggested the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The final diagnosis was multifocal tuberculosis, the patients received the resection of the mass in the spine. Anti-tuberculosis drugs were given. The myodynamia and muscle tension of the patients recovered following the therapy. Conclusions: Our results indicated that Multifocal tuberculosis should also be taken into consideration when lesions metastatic from system malignancy were suspected from images results even without the clinical symptoms of tuberculosis, and combination of multiple diagnosis methods were essential for the diagnosis of multifocal disease. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) is a preventable and curable disease, but increased mortality and morbidity associated with TB is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs known to regulate the host immune response against TB. We investigated the expression profile of candidate circulating miRNAs, which could be used as a blood biomarker for the effective diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis. A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted, including 30 children with active-TB and 30 healthy controls (HC) in a tertiary care hospital in Puducherry. We used the SYBR green-based miScript qRT-PCR assay to analyze the expression levels of miRNAs in plasma. Further, we used the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) to evaluate the diagnostic value of miRNAs. Active-TB included 25 (83.3%) pulmonary TB and 5 (16.7%) extrapulmonary TB cases. We found a significant upregulation of miR-21, miR-29a, miR-31, miR-155, and downregulation of miR-146a in children with active-TB compared to HC. The ROC analysis showed an excellent diagnostic value of miRNAs as follows: miR‑31> miR‑155> miR‑146a with AUC of (95% CI) miRNAs 0.978, 0.953, and 0.903, respectively. Altered circulating miRNA expression levels could be involved in the dysregulation of the host immune response to TB. The ROC analysis indicated that miRNAs miR-31, miR-155 and miR-146a could be effective diagnostic biomarkers for the detection of active-TB in children. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Objectives: Global tuberculosis (TB) control is restricted by the failure to detect an estimated 3.3 million TB cases annually. In the majority of TB endemic settings, sputum smear microscopy is used to diagnose TB, but this test is insensitive for TB in its early stages. The objective of this study is to establish a concise gene signature that discriminates between individuals with early TB disease, latent TB infection (LTBI) and those without infection. Methods: This is a case control study nested within a cluster-randomised trial of population screening for active TB using Xpert MTB/RIF. Whole blood samples from 303 participants with active TB (97), LTBI (92) and uninfected individuals (114) were subject to transcriptomic analysis of selected target genes based on a systematic review of previous studies. Results: Analysis of 82 genes identified a pattern of differentially expressed genes in TB disease. A seven gene signature was identified that distinguished between TB disease and no TB disease with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80–0.91), and between TB disease from LTBI with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82–0.93). Conclusion: This gene signature accurately distinguishes early TB disease from those without TB disease or infection, in the context of community-wide TB screening. It could be used as a non-sputum based screening tool or triage test to detect prevalent cases of TB in the community. © 2020},

abstract={Clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients lack microbiological evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis often occurs as a consequence. We investigated the potential of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and corresponding predictive models to diagnose these patients. We enrolled 1,764 subjects, including clinically diagnosed PTB patients, microbiologically confirmed PTB cases, non-TB disease controls, and healthy controls, in three cohorts (screening, selection, and validation). Candidate lncRNAs differentially expressed in blood samples of the PTB and healthy control groups were identified by microarray and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in the screening cohort. Logistic regression models were developed using lncRNAs and/or electronic health records (EHRs) from clinically diagnosed PTB patients and non-TB disease controls in the selection cohort. These models were evaluated by area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and decision curve analyses, and the optimal model was presented as a Web-based nomogram, which was evaluated in the validation cohort. Three differentially expressed lncRNAs (ENST00000497872, n333737, and n335265) were identified. The optimal model (i.e., nomogram) incorporated these three lncRNAs and six EHRs (age, hemoglobin, weight loss, low-grade fever, calcification detected by computed tomography [CT calcification], and interferon gamma release assay for tuberculosis [TB-IGRA]). The nomogram showed an AUC of 0.89, a sensitivity of 0.86, and a specificity of 0.82 in differentiating clinically diagnosed PTB cases from non-TB disease controls of the validation cohort, which demonstrated better discrimination and clinical net benefit than the EHR model. The nomogram also had a discriminative power (AUC, 0.90; sensitivity, 0.85; specificity, 0.81) in identifying microbiologically confirmed PTB patients. lncRNAs and the user-friendly nomogram could facilitate the early identification of PTB cases among suspected patients with negative M. tuberculosis microbiological evidence.

abstract={Background: Patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD) are at high risk to develop tuberculosis (TB) associated with a high mortality rate. TB diagnosis is often delayed due to non-specific symptoms, frequent extra-pulmonary manifestations, and rare microbiological confirmation. This case report illustrates the clear added value of combined interferon-γ-release assays (IGRA) in response to different mycobacterial antigens for an early diagnosis of TB in HD patients. Case presentation: We report the case of an Egyptian patient under chronic HD treatment, who presented with recurrent episodes of fever and myalgia of unknown origin, associated with an important inflammatory syndrome. These episodes resolved partially or completely within less than 1 month without any treatment but recurred 10 times within 3 years. Chest Computed Tomography and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (18FDG PET-CT) demonstrated several active mediastinal lymphadenopathies. TB was the first suspected diagnosis but cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remained negative on a mediastinal lymph node aspiration. In contrast, the results from two different IGRA performed on blood were highly suggestive of TB disease. Several granulomas, some of them with central non-caseating necrosis, were demonstrated on a pulmonary nodule obtained by thoracoscopic resection, but PCR and culture remained negative for M. tuberculosis. Three years after the initial symptoms, a new PET-CT revealed a retro-clavicular lymphadenopathy in addition to the mediastinal lymphadenopathies, and the M. tuberculosis culture performed on the resected lymphadenopathy was positive. Antibiotic treatment for TB was started and resulted in a clear improvement of the patient's clinical condition, allowing him to successfully receive a renal graft. Conclusions: In view of the high frequency of TB in patients undergoing chronic HD and of the limitations of the classical diagnosis procedures, nephrologists have to diagnose TB mostly on clinical suspicion. We demonstrate here that the use of a combined IGRA to two different mycobacterial antigens may significantly raise the index of suspicion and help clinicians to decide starting anti-TB treatment in HD patients. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: The clinical and epidemiological significance of HIV-associated Mycobacterium tuberculosis bloodstream infection (BSI) is incompletely understood. We hypothesised that M tuberculosis BSI prevalence has been underestimated, that it independently predicts death, and that sputum Xpert MTB/RIF has suboptimal diagnostic yield for M tuberculosis BSI. Methods: We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies performing routine mycobacterial blood culture in a prospectively defined patient population of people with HIV aged 13 years or older. Studies were identified through searching PubMed and Scopus up to Nov 10, 2018, without language or date restrictions and through manual review of reference lists. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with an adapted QUADAS-2 framework. IPD were requested for all identified studies and subject to harmonised inclusion criteria: age 13 years or older, HIV positivity, available CD4 cell count, a valid mycobacterial blood culture result (excluding patients with missing data from lost or contaminated blood cultures), and meeting WHO definitions for suspected tuberculosis (presence of screening symptom). Predicted probabilities of M tuberculosis BSI from mixed-effects modelling were used to estimate prevalence. Estimates of diagnostic yield of sputum testing with Xpert (or culture if Xpert was unavailable) and of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing for M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by two-level random-effect meta-analysis. Estimates of mortality associated with M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by mixed-effect Cox proportional-hazard modelling and of effect of treatment delay on mortality by propensity-score analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016050022. Findings: We identified 23 datasets for inclusion (20 published and three unpublished at time of search) and obtained IPD from 20, representing 96·2% of eligible IPD. Risk of bias for the included studies was assessed to be generally low except for on the patient selection domain, which was moderate in most studies. 5751 patients met harmonised IPD-level inclusion criteria. Technical factors such as number of blood cultures done, timing of blood cultures relative to blood sampling, and patient factors such as inpatient setting and CD4 cell count, explained significant heterogeneity between primary studies. The predicted probability of M tuberculosis BSI in hospital inpatients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, WHO danger signs, and a CD4 count of 76 cells per μL (the median for the cohort) was 45% (95% CI 38–52). The diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with M tuberculosis BSI was 77% (95% CI 63–87), increasing to 89% (80–94) when combined with urine LAM testing. Presence of M tuberculosis BSI compared with its absence in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis increased risk of death before 30 days (adjusted hazard ratio 2·48, 95% CI 2·05–3·08) but not after 30 days (1·25, 0·84–2·49). In a propensity-score matched cohort of participants with HIV-associated tuberculosis (n=630), mortality increased in patients with M tuberculosis BSI who had a delay in anti-tuberculosis treatment of longer than 4 days compared with those who had no delay (odds ratio 3·15, 95% CI 1·16–8·84). Interpretation: In critically ill adults with HIV-tuberculosis, M tuberculosis BSI is a frequent manifestation of tuberculosis and predicts mortality within 30 days. Improved diagnostic yield in patients with M tuberculosis BSI could be achieved through combined use of sputum Xpert and urine LAM. Anti-tuberculosis treatment delay might increase the risk of mortality in these patients.

abstract={Introduction: Dental pulp with special structure has become a good reference sample in paleomicrobiology-related blood-borne diseases, many pathogens were detected by different methods based on the diagnosis of nucleic acids and proteins. Objectives: This review aims to propose the preparation process from ancient teeth collection to organic molecule extraction of dental pulp and summary, analyze the methods that have been applied to detect septicemic pathogens through ancient dental pulps during the past 20 years following the first detection of an ancient microbe. Methods: The papers used in this review with two main objectives were obtained from PubMed and Google scholar with combining keywords: “ancient,” “dental pulp,” “teeth,” “anatomy,” “structure,” “collection,” “preservation,” “selection,” “photography,” “radiography,” “contamination,” “decontamination,” “DNA,” “protein,” “extraction,” “bone,” “paleomicrobiology,” “bacteria,” “virus,” “pathogen,” “molecular biology,” “proteomics,” “PCR,” “MALDI-TOF,” “LC/MS,” “ELISA,” “immunology,” “immunochromatography,” “genome,” “microbiome,” “metagenomics.”. Results: The analysis of ancient dental pulp should have a careful preparation process with many different steps to give highly accurate results, each step complies with the rules in archaeology and paleomicrobiology. After the collection of organic molecules from dental pulp, they were investigated for pathogen identification based on the analysis of DNA and protein. Actually, DNA approach takes a principal role in diagnosis while the protein approach is more and more used. A total of seven techniques was used and ten bacteria (Yersinia pestis, Bartonella quintana, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi C, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia prowazeki, Staphylococcus aureus, Borrelia recurrentis, Bartonella henselae) and one virus (Anelloviridae) were identified. Y. pestis had the most published in quantity and all methods were investigated for this pathogen, S. aureus and B. recurrentis were identified by three different methods and others only by one. The combining methods interestingly increase the positive rate with ELISA, PCR and iPCR in Yersinia pestis diagnosis. Twenty-seven ancient genomes of Y. pestis and one ancient genome of B. recurrentis were reconstructed. Comparing to the ancient bone, ancient teeth showed more advantage in septicemic diagnosis. Beside pathogen identification, ancient pulp help to distinguish species. Conclusions: Dental pulp with specific tissue is a suitable sample for detection of the blood infection in the past through DNA and protein identification with the correct preparation process, furthermore, it helps to more understand the pathogens of historic diseases and epidemics. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis. During early-stage infection, M. bovis-infected cattle shed mycobacteria through nasal secretions, which can be detected via nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments. Little research has focused on immune responses in nested PCR-positive (bTB PCR-P) or nested PCR-negative (bTB PCR-N) M. bovis-infected cattle. Here, we investigated the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), with or without stimulation by purified protein derivative of bovine tuberculin (PPD-B), among bTB PCR-P, bTB PCR-N, and healthy cattle using RNA-Seq. We also explored the potential value of PBMC transcripts as novel biomarkers for diagnosing bTB. Numerous differentially expressed genes were identified following pair-wise comparison of different groups, with or without PPD-B stimulation (adjusted p < 0.05). Compared with healthy cattle, bTB PCR-P, and bTB PCR-N cattle shared 5 significantly dysregulated biological pathways, including Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, Hematopoietic cell lineage, Osteoclast differentiation and HTLV-I infection. Notably, dysregulated biological pathways of bTB PCR-P and bTB PCR-N cattle were associated with cell death and phagocytosis, respectively. Lymphotoxin alpha and interleukin-8 could potentially differentiate M. bovis-infected and healthy cattle upon stimulation with PPD-B, with area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of 0.9991 and 0.9343, respectively. B cell lymphoma 2 and chitinase 3-like 1 might enable differentiation between bTB PCR-P and bTB PCR-N upon stimulation with PPD-B, with AUC values of 0.9100 and 0.8893, respectively. Thus, the PBMC transcriptome revealed the immune responses in M. bovis-infected cattle (bTB PCR-P and bTB PCR-N) and may provide a novel sight in bTB diagnosis. © Copyright © 2020 Fang, Lin, Jia, Gao, Sui, Guo, Hou, Jiang, Zhu, Zhu, Ding, Jiang and Xin.},

abstract={目的： 对5个结核分枝杆菌重组蛋白及其组合物的细胞免疫进行评价。 方法： 88份新鲜肝素抗凝人群外周静脉血液，其中42份来自北京市昌平区结核病防治所就诊的结核病患者，46份健康志愿者由中国疾病预防控制中心传染病所提供，均为接种过卡介苗（BCG）且没有结核暴露史和任何临床症状体征的健康人。以结核分枝杆菌标准菌株H37Rv DNA为模板，PCR扩增选取的5个重组蛋白Rv3874、Rv3875、Rv2031c、Rv1411c和Rv3418c的完整编码基因；通过基因重组和蛋白纯化技术，分别克隆、表达和纯化5个重组蛋白作为刺激物，采用效应T细胞酶联免疫斑点试验（ELISPOT）对人群进行细胞免疫检测。 结果： 成功克隆、表达和纯化了Rv3874、Rv3875、Rv2031c、Rv1411c和Rv3418c重组蛋白；灵敏度分别为50.00%、71.43%、69.04%、73.81%和76.19%；特异度分别为86.96%、76.09%、71.74%、39.13%和36.96%。阳性预测值、阴性预测值、曲线下面积及约登指数分别为52.46%~77.78%、62.96%~74.47%、0.511~0.754和0.129~0.475。除Rv1411c和Rv3418c外，Rv3874、Rv3875和Rv2031c在结核病患者中检测到的斑点形成细胞数均高于健康志愿者，差异均具有统计学意义（P值均<0.001）。在5个重组蛋白所构成的26种组合物中，灵敏度为80.95%~95.24%，特异度为68.89%~24.44%。随着组合物中重组蛋白个数的增加其灵敏度逐渐增加，但特异度随之下降。 结论： 结核分枝杆菌重组蛋白Rv3874、Rv3875和Rv2031c刺激T细胞产生免疫应答的能力较强，具有一定的抗原性。而Rv1411c和Rv3418c单独用作诊断抗原的效能并不理想，与多组分抗原联合构成的组合物具有一定应用价值。.
Objective: The cellular immunity of 5 Mycobacterium tuberculosis recombinant proteins and their compositions was evaluated. Method: A total of 88 fresh venous blood from peripheral heparin anticoagulant population, 42 of which were from tuberculosis patients treated by The Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Center of Changping District, Beijing, and 46 of healthy volunteers were provided by the Infection Diseases of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Healthy volunteers without a history of tuberculosis exposure and any clinical signs and symptoms. Using the Mycobacterium tuberculosis standard strain H37Rv DNA as a template, complete genes of the selected 5 recombinant proteins Rv3874, Rv3875, Rv2031c, Rv1411c and Rv3418c by PCR amplified; 5 recombinant proteins were cloned, expressed and purified as stimulants by genetic recombination and protein purification techniques, and the effector T cell enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) was used to detect cellular immunity in the population. Results: The recombinant proteins Rv3874, Rv3875, Rv2031c, Rv1411c and Rv3418c were successfully cloned, expressed and purified; And the sensitivities were 50.00%, 71.43%, 69.04%, 73.81% and 76.19%, and the specificities were 86.96%, 76.09%, 71.74%, 39.13% and 36.96%. In addition, the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the curve and Youden index were 52.46% to 77.78%, 62.96% to 74.47%, 0.511 to 0.754 and 0.129 to 0.475, respectively. Except for Rv1411c and Rv3418c, the number of spot-forming cell (SFC) detected by Rv3874, Rv3875 and Rv2031c in tuberculosis patients was higher than healthy volunteers, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.001). Among the 26 compositions composed of 5 recombinant proteins, the sensitivity was 80.95% to 95.24%, and the specificity was 68.89% to 24.44%. As the number of recombinant proteins in the composition increases, the sensitivity gradually increased, but the specificity decreased. Conclusion: The recombinant proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv3874, Rv3875 and Rv2031c have strong ability to stimulate T cells to produce immune response, and have certain antigenicity. The efficacy of Rv1411c and Rv3418c alone as diagnostic antigens is not ideal, and the composition composed of multi-component antigens has certain application value. This article provides experimental evidence for the immune diagnosis of tuberculosis and the preparation of new anti-tuberculosis vaccines.},

We present a patient with definite TBM confirmed by positive Xpert MTB/RIF assay of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) who developed binocular blindness two weeks after diagnosis and initiation of standard anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT). Ophthalmological exam demonstrated complete bilateral abducens nerve palsies, impaired pupillary responses to light, normal optic discs, and visual acuity of hand motion only in each eye. Brain CT showed progressive enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles. We managed the patient medically with dexamethasone, acetazolamide, and substitution of moxifloxacin for ethambutol. Serial brain CTs confirmed gradual resolution of hydrocephalus. The patient had complete neurological recovery at six months except for residual blindness in the right eye. Visual acuity in the left eye recovered to normal (20/20). The assessment and management of vision impairment in TBM is discussed. © 2020},

abstract={Background A relevant case of pulmonary sporotrichosis due to Sporothrix brasiliensis is reported in a 50-year-old immunocompetent woman who had no history of skin trauma, but was in close contact with several stray cats at her nap time. The patient was hospitalized after 7 months of illness. The survey was conducted for pulmonary tuberculosis, an endemic disease in Brazil. She presented multiple central pulmonary nodules images, with central cavitation. Methodology/Principal findings The patient bronchoalveolar lavage was cultured and Sporothrix sp. growth was obtained. Then, the isolate (LMMM1097) was accurately identified to the species level by using spe-cies-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Molecular diagnosis revealed that the emerging species Sporothrix brasiliensis was the agent of primary pulmonary sporotrichosis and the patient was treated with Amphotericin B lipid complex, but presented severe clinical symptoms and the fatal outcome was observed at day 25 after hospitalization. Conclusions/Significance Our report adds important contributions to the clinical-epidemiological features of sporotri-chosis, showing the geographic expansion of the agent within different regions of Brazil and a rare clinical manifestation (primary pulmonary sporotrichosis) caused by the emerging agent S. brasiliensis in an immunocompetent female patient. © 2020 do Monte Alves et al.},

abstract={Background: Blood transcriptional signatures are candidates for non-sputum triage or confirmatory tests of tuberculosis. Prospective head-to-head comparisons of their diagnostic accuracy in real-world settings are necessary to assess their clinical use. We aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of candidate transcriptional signatures identified by systematic review, in a setting with a high burden of tuberculosis and HIV. Methods: We did a prospective observational study nested within a diagnostic accuracy study of sputum Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) tests for pulmonary tuberculosis. We recruited consecutive symptomatic adults aged 18 years or older self-presenting to a tuberculosis clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. Participants provided blood for RNA sequencing, and sputum samples for liquid culture and molecular testing using Xpert and Ultra. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of candidate blood transcriptional signatures for active tuberculosis (including those intended to distinguish active tuberculosis from other diseases) identified by systematic review, compared with culture or Xpert MTB/RIF positivity as the standard reference. In our primary analysis, patients with tuberculosis were defined as those with either a positive liquid culture or Xpert result. Patients with missing blood RNA or sputum results were excluded. Our primary objective was to benchmark the diagnostic accuracy of candidate transcriptional signatures against the WHO target product profile (TPP) for a tuberculosis triage test. Findings: Between Feb 12, 2016, and July 18, 2017, we obtained paired sputum and RNA sequencing data from 181 participants, 54 (30%) of whom had confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Of 27 eligible signatures identified by systematic review, four achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy with similar area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (Sweeney3: 90·6% [95% CI 85·6–95·6]; Kaforou25: 86·9% [80·9–92·9]; Roe3: 86·9% [80·3–93·5]; and BATF2: 86·8% [80·6–93·1]), independent of age, sex, HIV status, previous tuberculosis, or sputum smear result. At test thresholds that gave 70% specificity (the minimum WHO TPP specificity for a triage test), these four signatures achieved sensitivities between 83·3% (95% CI 71·3–91·0) and 90·7% (80·1–96·0). No signature met the optimum criteria, of 95% sensitivity and 80% specificity proposed by WHO for a triage test, or the minimum criteria (of 65% sensitivity and 98% specificity) for a confirmatory test, but all four correctly identified Ultra-positive, culture-negative patients. Interpretation: Selected blood transcriptional signatures met the minimum WHO benchmarks for a tuberculosis triage test but not for a confirmatory test. Further development of the signatures is warranted to investigate their possible effects on clinical and health economic outcomes as part of a triage strategy, or when used as add-on confirmatory test in conjunction with the highly sensitive Ultra test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA.

abstract={Background: There are limited data on the etiology of respiratory infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in resource-limited settings. Methods: We performed quantitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Pneumocystis jirovecii and common bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens on sputum samples (spontaneous or induced) from a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected inpatients with World Health Organization danger signs and cough. Mycobacterial culture was done on 2 sputum samples, blood cultures, and relevant extrapulmonary samples. Results: We enrolled 284 participants from 2 secondary-level hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa: median CD4 count was 97 cells/μL, 64% were women, and 38% were on antiretroviral therapy. One hundred forty-eight had culture-positive tuberculosis, 100 had community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), 26 had P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), and 64 had other diagnoses. Probable bacterial infection (&gt;105 copies/mL) was detected in 133 participants; the prevalence was highest in those with CAP (52%). Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the commonest bacterial pathogens detected; atypical bacteria were uncommon. Viruses were detected in 203 participants; the prevalence was highest in those with PJP (85%). Human metapneumovirus was the commonest virus detected. Multiple coinfections were commonly detected. Conclusions: Sputum multiplex PCR could become a useful diagnostic tool for bacterial respiratory infections in HIV-infected inpatients, but its value is limited as quantitative cutoffs have only been established for a few bacterial pathogens and validation has not been done in this patient population. We found a high prevalence of respiratory viruses, but it is unclear whether these viruses were causing infection as there are no accepted quantitative PCR cutoffs for diagnosing respiratory viral infections. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

abstract={Background: Although novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA point-of-care technology has the potential to enhance the diagnosis in resource-limited settings, very little real-world validation of their utility exists. We evaluate the performance of HCV RNA quantification using the Xpert® HCV viral load Fingerstick assay (Xpert® HCV VL Fingerstick assay) as compared to the World Health Organisation pre-qualified plasma Xpert® HCV VL assay among people who inject drugs (PWID) attending an opioid agonist therapy (OAT) clinic in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. Methods: Between December 2018 and February 2019, consecutive HCV seropositive PWID attending the OAT clinic provided paired venous and Fingerstick samples for HCV RNA quantification. These were processed onsite using the GeneXpert® platform located at the Central tuberculosis reference laboratory. Results: A total of 208 out of 220 anti-HCV-positive participants recruited (94.5%) had a valid Xpert® HCV VL result available; 126 (61%; 95% CI 53.8-67.0) had detectable and quantifiable HCV RNA. About 188 (85%) participants had paired plasma and Fingerstick whole blood samples; the sensitivity and specificity for the quantification of HCV RNA levels were 99.1% and 98.7% respectively. There was an excellent correlation (R2 =.95) and concordance (mean difference 0.13 IU/mL, (95% CI −0.9 to 0.16 IU/mL) in HCV RNA levels between plasma samples and Fingerstick samples. Conclusion: This study found excellent performance of the Xpert® HCV VL Fingerstick assay for HCV RNA detection and quantification in an African-field setting. Its clinical utility represents an important watershed in overcoming existing challenges to HCV diagnosis, which should play a crucial role in HCV elimination in Africa. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Current tools for screening LTBI are limited due to the long turnaround time required, cross-reactivity of tuberculin skin test to BCG vaccine and the high cost of interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) tests. We evaluated Raman spectroscopy (RS) for serum-protein fingerprinting from 26 active TB (ATB) cases, 20 LTBI cases, 34 early clearance (EC; TB-exposed persons with undetected infection) and 38 healthy controls (HC). RS at 532 nm using candidate peaks provided 92.31% sensitivity and 90.0% to distinguish ATB from LTBI, 84.62% sensitivity and 89.47% specificity to distinguish ATB from HC and 87.10% sensitivity and 85.0% specificity to distinguish LTBI from EC. RS at 532 nm with the random forest model provided 86.84% sensitivity and 65.0% specificity to distinguish LTBI from HC and 94.74% sensitivity and 87.10% specificity to distinguish EC from HC. Using preliminary sample sets (n = 5 for each TB-infection category), surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) showed high potential diagnostic performance, distinguishing very clearly among all TB-infection categories with 100% sensitivity and specificity. With lower cost, shorter turnaround time and performance comparable to that of IGRAs, our study demonstrated RS and SERS to have high potential for ATB and LTBI diagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction: Herpes encephalitis is a neurological emergency disorder. In this paper, a case of sporadic herpes encephalitis in a pregnant woman at 26 weeks of gestation was reported. Case presentation: The patient was a 30-year-old pregnant woman with gestational age of 26 weeks that due to decreased consciousness, confusion, failure to answer questions, disorientation, nausea and vomiting, headache on both sides of the temporal region and Dysphoria was admitted in gynecology ward of Bojnourd Bentolhoda Hospital. On admission, vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. Magnesium sulfate was administered because of suspected neurological symptoms of eclampsia and proteinuria. Brain MRI was performed after 8 hours due to fever, continued disturbance of consciousness and generalized tonic-clonic seizure that bilateral involvement of the temporal and left frontal areas was evident. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed Sharps waves in the left frontal, which was consistent with seizure disorder. Intravenous acyclovir was administered after convulsions and exacerbation of neurological symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Herpes simplex virus 1 and Brucella in Cerebrospinal Fluid was negative. Level of Protein, leukocytes and RBC was increased in CSF analysis. Blood cultures and serum tests for brucellosis (2-mercaptomethanol and Wright's agglutination test) were negative. PCR was not repeated because of the patient's dissatisfaction. According to the results of laboratory tests, brain MRI and EEG, diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis was suggested. The patient improved and was discharged after 14 days of hospitalization. Healthy baby was born by vaginal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation. Conclusion: In the event of neurological symptoms in pregnant women (headache, dizziness, and altered consciousness), an urgent consultation with a neurologist is required to rule out other differential life-threatening diagnoses other than eclampsia such as herpes simplex encephalitis. Since there is no specific guideline for management of viral encephalitis in pregnancy, guidelines designed for non-pregnant women are recommended in these cases. © 2020, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

abstract={We report an AIDS patient with a high HIV RNA copy number in the plasma who was successfully treated for prolonged Mycobacterium avium bacteremia and other complications. An HIV-infected patient with high fever, anemia, high alkaline phosphatase, cystic lung lesions, hepatitis B virus infection and Kaposi's sarcoma was referred to our hospital. PCR of the blood revealed Mycobacterium avium bacteremia and the time to blood culture positivity was 8 days. The HIV-1 RNA copy number in the plasma was more than ten million copies/ml and the CD4-positive T cell count was 21 cells/μL. Although the high fever resolved five days after therapy for Mycobacterium avium was started, the fever recurred just before starting anti-retroviral therapy (ART) including dolutegravir. The patient experienced repeated but self-limiting bouts of severe inflammation. Mycobacteremia was intermittently detected up to 79 days, suggesting that the recurrent episodes of inflammation were due to the intermittent dissemination of mycobacteria, and that persistent treatment is needed. Five months after the beginning of ART, the HIV-1 RNA copy number in the plasma was still 28,000 copies/ml. An HIV drug-resistance test revealed sensitivity to all anti-retroviral drugs. Eleven months after the initiation of ART, the HIV RNA copy number in the plasma decreased to 45 copies/mL and the CD4-positive T cell count recovered to 205 cells/μL. Our case also suggests that dolutegravir can be effective in cases with prolonged high levels of HIV RNA. Our findings emphasize that prompt diagnosis and persistent therapy for mycobacterial infection are important for successful treatment. © 2019 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases},

abstract={Background: We evaluated the application value of Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT.TB in the diagnosis of bone and joint tuberculosis. Methods: One hundred two patients with suspected bone and joint tuberculosis (BJTB) were admitted to Zhengzhou Orthopaedics Hospital, Henan, China from April 2018 to February 2019. The Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT.TB tests were performed using pus specimens and peripheral blood, respectively. The diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT.TB tests was evaluated on the basis of the composite reference standard (CRS). Result: A Total of 73 suspected BJTB were enrolled and categorized, including 12 confirmed BJTB, 27 probable BJTB and 34 non-BJTB. When CRS was used as the reference, the specificity, PPV and NLR values of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay were significantly higher than those of the T-SPOT.TB assay (97.1% vs. 82.4%, p < 0.05; 96.7% vs. 85.4%, p < 0.05; 0.26 vs. 0.12, p < 0.05). However, the sensitivity, NPV and PLR values of the T-SPOT. TB assay were significantly higher than those of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (89.7% vs. 74.4%, p < 0.05; 87.5% vs. 76.7%, p < 0.05; 5.08 vs. 2.52, p < 0.05). The AUCs from Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT. TB tests were 0.857 and 0.860, respectively. However, the difference was not statistically significant. The Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT. TB tests demonstrated medium concordance in diagnosing BJTB. Conclusion: The sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB test combined with the specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF not only shorten the time of diagnosis but also improve the accuracy of diagnosis of BJTB and reduce the misdiagnosis rate. Therefore, they are useful for early diagnosis of BJTB. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most devastating form of tuberculosis (TB) but diagnosis is difficult and delays in initiating therapy increase mortality. All currently available tests are imperfect; culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is considered the most accurate test but is often negative, even when disease is present, and takes too long to be useful for immediate decision making. Rapid tests that are frequently used are conventional Ziehl-Neelsen staining and nucleic acid amplification tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra. While positive results will often confirm the diagnosis, negative tests frequently provide insufficient evidence to withhold therapy. The conventional diagnostic approach is to determine the probability of TBM using experience and intuition, based on prevalence of TB, history, examination, analysis of basic blood and CSF parameters, imaging, and rapid test results. Treatment decisions may therefore be both variable and inaccurate, depend on the experience of the clinician, and requests for tests may be inappropriate. In this article we discuss the use of Bayes' theorem and the threshold model of decision making as ways to improve testing and treatment decisions in TBM. Bayes' theorem describes the process of converting the pre-test probability of disease to the post-test probability based on test results and the threshold model guides clinicians to make rational test and treatment decisions. We discuss the advantages and limitations of using these methods and suggest that new diagnostic strategies should ultimately be tested in randomised trials. © 2020 Boyles TH et al.},

abstract={Introduction: Laboratory and clinical features of childhood tuberculosis (TB) are non-specific and establishing an accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. This study evaluated a Single tube nested-PCR (STNPCR) to detect genomic DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in blood and urine. Methods: Biological samples were obtained from children (<15 years old) with clinical suspicion of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB at public hospitals in Recife-Pernambuco, Brazil. Cultures yielded negative results in a majority of childhood TB cases, which are generally paucibacillary. A set of clinical, epidemiological, radiological, and laboratory criteria with evident clinical improvement after anti-TB treatment were frequently used to define childhood TB cases. Results: Ninety children with clinical suspicion were enrolled in this study (44 with TB and 46 without TB). The pulmonary TB group had 20 confirmed cases and 46 negative controls, while the extrapulmonary TB group had 24 confirmed cases. The STNPCR showed sensitivities to pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB of 47.4% and 52.2% (blood) and 38.8% and 20% (urine), respectively. Considering the low performance of STNPCR on separate samples, we decided to perform a combined analysis (parallel sensitivity analysis) of the results from blood and urine samples. The parallel sensitivity increased to 65% in blood and 62.5% in urine. The specificity in both samples ranged from 93.5–97.8%. Conclusions: Although STNPCR showed moderate sensitivity, the specificity is high; therefore, the test can be used as an auxiliary tool to diagnose TB in children. It is a rapid test that demonstrated better performance than other diagnostic tests in paucibacillary samples as it does in childhood tuberculosis. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

abstract={The aging phenomenon of tuberculosis (TB) patients is recognized all over the world, but no country is as prominent as Japan. Central nervous system (CNS) TB includes clinical entities: tuberculous meningitis, intracranial tuberculoma, and clinical features of CNS TB in the elderly may be atypical, non-specific, and confused with concomitant age-related diseases. Atypical clinical manifestations of TB in older persons can result in delay in diagnosis and initiation of treatment. A 91-year-old woman was brought to our emergency department after her family noted her altered mental status. Chest computed tomography confirmed miliary opacities. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed elevated protein level, low glucose level, and a lymphocytic pleocytosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple well‑defined enhancing lesions in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres and the pons, suggestive of tuberculomas. Smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum and aspirate. Based on the CSF and brain MRI findings and the sputum microbiology results indicating the presence of M. tuberculosis in the sputum and gastric aspirate, the patient was diagnosed with CNS tuberculoma. The onset of TB is mainly associated with decreased immunity; however, several other factors such as comorbidities, decreased activity, dysphagia, and malnutrition, which influence one another, also influence the development of TB in the elderly. Because the mortality rate of TB increases rapidly with age, reaching approximately 30 % among the elderly, early diagnosis is critical. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Unusual clinical course Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a major public health problem worldwide. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis at the level of the central nervous system is the most devastating and deadly form of tuberculosis. We present the case of a 73-year-old male Ecuadorian patient with no history of contact with tuberculosis and with a clinical picture of 4 days of evolution characterized by aphasia, deviation of the labial commissure, and deterioration of the level of consciousness with a Glasgow coma score of 7/15. A brain tomography showed evidence of indirect signs of cerebral ischemia; the patient was therefore diagnosed with non-specific cerebrovascular disease. Due to the critical nature of his clinical picture, the patient entered the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where a chest x-ray was performed and bilateral perihilar alveolar opacities with a reticular and nodular pattern were visualized. These results, combined with the bronchoalveolar brushing, evidenced the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Adenosine of deaminase (ADA) was also detected in the cerebrospinal fluid with 30.7 µ/L and a molecular biology technique was used with high-multiplex real-time polymerase matrix MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Brucker Daltonics) for rapid identification of the causative agent. DNA/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses were used for detection of M. tuberculosis, subsequently confirming the presence of cerebral tuberculosis. This case illustrated an infrequent form of disseminated tuberculosis in a critically ill patient. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management are essential to reducing mortality. © Am J Case Rep, 2020;.},

abstract={Background: The development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) poses a con-siderable threat to tuberculosis control programmes in Nigeria. There is an increase in the prevalence of MDR-TB worldwide both among new tuberculosis cases as well as previously-treated ones. There is also a rise in transmission of resistant strains due to an increase in MDR-TB patients largely due to the poor drug compliance and the impact of Human immunodeficiency virus infection. Therefore, we in-tend to determine the extent of MDR-TB among attendees of chest clinics in Osun-State, Nigeria. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MDR-TB among confirmed tuberculosis patients attending chest clinics in Osun-State, Nigeria. Methods: This study was conducted among 207 attendees of chest clinics in Osun-State between June, 2015 and October 15, 2016. Sputum and blood samples of the participants were collected. GeneXpert test was carried out first on the samples for simultaneous identification of MTB and rifampicin re-sistance. Sputum samples were cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) medium using N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH) decontamination method. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) to three first-line drugs was carried out using the proportion DST method. Results: The prevalence of MTB was found to be 27.5% while the prevalence of MDR-TB from the fifty-seven isolates was 10.5%. Previously treated and new cases had a prevalence of 7.0% and 3.5% MDR-TB, respectively. Seventy (33.8%) participants were positive for HIV infection, out of which twenty-six (12.6%) had co-infection of tuberculosis and HIV. The mono-resistance rates of the three first-line drugs used were: 5.3% and 8.7% for ethambutol (EMB) and isoniazid (INH), respectively. No isolate had mono-resistance (0%) to rifampicin (RIF). Conclusion: This study observed the prevalence of 27.5% MTB and a prevalence of 10.5% MDR-TB among the MTB isolates. The prevalence of TB is high in Osun State. MDR-TB prevalence is higher compared with the national estimate of MDR-TB (5.1%) of 2017. Resistant TB is a threat to national tuberculosis control and it is recommended that all the facilities be equipped to cater to its diagnosis. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Purpose: To identify candidate hub genes and miRNAs associated with active tuberculosis (ATB) and reveal the potential molecular mechanisms of disease progression. Patients and Methods: The expression of mRNA and miRNA was evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 4 ATB patients and 4 healthy donors (HD) using high throughput sequencing (HTS) and bioinformatics analysis. Moreover, differentially expressed miRNAs were validated with 35 ATB patients and 35 HDs using reverse transcrip-tion quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: A total of 2658 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEG) including 1415 up-regulated genes and 1243 down-regulated genes were identified in the ATB group compared with HDs, and the DEGs enriched in immune-related pathways, especially in TNF signaling pathway, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways and tuberculosis. Additionally, 10 hub genes were acquired according to protein–protein interaction (PPI) analysis of DEGs. Moreover, 26 differentially expressed miRNAs were found in ATB group compared with HDs. Furthermore, RT-qPCR results showed that hsa-miR-23a-5p (P=0.0106), hsa-miR-183-5p (P=0.0027), hsa-miR-193a-5p (P=0.0021) and hsa-miR-941(P=0.0001) were significantly increased in the ATB patients compared with HD group, and the hsa-miR-16-1-3p was significantly decreased (P=0.0032). Conclusion: Our research provided a characteristic profile of mRNAs and miRNAs expressed in ATB subjects, and 10 hub genes related with ATB were found, which will contribute to explore the role of miRNAs and hub genes in the pathogenesis of ATB, and improve the ability of differential diagnosis and treatment for the disease. © 2020 Cao et al.},

abstract={Purpose: To describe the clinicopathological, microbiological and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study in a case of Nocardia scleritis. Methods: A retrospective chart review. Results: A 32-year old male presented with pain, redness and nodular scleral swelling in the left eye for the past two and a half months following an accidental rice powder injury. He was earlier diagnosed to have tubercular scleritis and treated with oral steroids and anti-tubercular therapy. A repeat scleral biopsy on histopathological examination showed granulomatous inflammation. Microbiological investigations revealed the growth of Gram +ve branching filamentous bacilli in culture suggestive of Nocardia sp. PCR based DNA sequencing identified the bacterium as Nocardia cyriacigeorgica. The patient responded to topical fortified amikacin (2.5%), fortified cefuroxime, oral sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim with complete healing of scleritis. Conclusions: Nocardia scleritis can be a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Newer molecular techniques along with histopathological and microbiological investigations can clinch the diagnosis. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: Ocular syphilis is re-emerging globally especially in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Atypical manifestations of ocular syphilis and/or other associated opportunistic infections often lead to a diagnostic dilemma. We evaluated the utility of aqueous humor (AH) Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) titers in the diagnosis of ocular syphilis. Methods: Retrospective case series of five HIV positive patients with positive syphilis serology in whom AH sampling was performed. All patients had ocular manifestations suspicious of infectious etiology. Results: Panuveitis with/without retinitis was the commonest presentation. Along with blood investigations, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing from AH was done for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Toxoplasma gondii. In addition, serum antibody titers for Toxoplasma, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and TPHA tests for syphilis were done. In patients with raised serum RPR/TPHA, aqueous TPHA titers were also assessed. Mean serum RPR titer was ≥ 1:32 and TPHA titer was ≥1:1280. Aqueous humor titers of TPHA was high in all patients (range ≥ 1:320 to ≥1:5120). Aqueous PCR was negative for all other infectious etiologies in four patients. In one patient, PCR-CMV was also positive, suggestive of a dual infection. Post-treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and appropriate anti-syphilitic regime, complete resolution of lesions with corresponding fall in the serum RPR/TPHA titers were noted in all patients. Conclusions: Ocular syphilis with atypical presentations is usually diagnosed based on a positive syphilis serology and by excluding other infectious causes. In the present study, we have shown an excellent correlation between raised AH TPHA titers with serological values and the clinical presentation. Considering the ease of collection of AH in contrast to vitreous fluids, the AH-TPHA assay could potentially be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of ocular syphilis. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: The aim of the work was to detect a diagnostic value of CNSToxoIndex - index of correlation between albumin concentration and anti-toxoplasma antibodies, which reflects local production of anti-toxoplasma IgG in CNS compared with their level in blood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 30 HIV-infected persons with the IV clinical stage (16 man and 14 women) aged from 25 to 49 years with clinical and instrumental signs of cerebral toxoplasmosis were selected from the general array of the patients treated in the Regional Clinical Infectious Hospital. A retrospective parallel detection of IgG T. gondii was performed in serum and CSF in patients, whose results of ELISA or PCR on T. gondii were positive. Blood serum and CSF were obtained from patients at the same time. All samples for analysis were stored at -20 °C and then tested on the RT-2100C Rayto Life and Analytical Sciences Co., Ltd (China) immunoassay analyser for quantitative detection of the level of specific anti-Toxicoplasma IgG. Detection of albumin concentration in serum and CSF was performed on the Chemray-120 Automated Biochemical Analyzer Rayto Life and Analytical Sciences Co., Ltd (China) using the Liquick Cor-ALBUMIN Diagnostic Kit. RESULTS: Results: Specific IgG to T. gondii in blood plasma was found in 27 patients (90%) while in CSF only in 7 (23 %). The results of the research in this group of patients were represented by the following parameters: patient 1 (blood antiToxo IgG - 200 IU/ml, blood albumin - 36 g/l, CSF antiToxo IgG - 10 IU/ml, CSF albumin - 0.8 g/l, CNSToxolndex - 2.3); patient 2 (150 / 40 / 90 / 0.7 / 34.3, respectively); patient 3 (90 / 35 / 64 / 0.25 / 99.6); patient 4 (140 / 39/ 10/ 0.19/ 14.7); patient 5 (88 / 52 / 48 / 0.21 / 135.1); patient 6 (160 / 48 / 50 /0.15 / 100.0); patient 7 (122 / 42 / 15 / 0.17 / 30.4). Consequently, taking into consideration the diagnostic marker CNSToxolndex more than 10.0, cerebral toxoplasmosis was diagnosed only in six patients from seven, in whom anti-toxoplasma antibodies in CSF were detected. Patient 1, despite clinical symptoms similar to cerebral toxoplasmosis, and substitute signs of cerebral toxoplasmosis detected with the help of neuroimaging methods (volumetric formation of the right frontal lobe with a ring-shaped enhancement), availability of specific anti-toxoplasma antibodies in blood serum and CSF, diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis has not been confirmed. M. tuberculosis DNA was found in CSF by PCR. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: CNSToxoIndex allows evaluating the local production of anti-toxoplasmic IgG in CNS and their diffusion from blood as a result of the blood-brain barrier damageand it is a powerful method of cerebral toxoplasmosis diagnostics in HIV-positive people as well.},

abstract={Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection in humans can cause active disease or latent infection. However, the factors contributing to the maintenance of latent infection vs. disease progression are poorly understood. In this study, we used a genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach to identify host factors associated with M. tuberculosis infection status and a novel gene signature that can distinguish active disease from latent infection. By RNA-seq, we characterized transcriptional differences in purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) among three groups: patients with active tuberculosis (ATB), individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI), and TB-uninfected controls (CON). A total of 401 differentially expressed genes enabled grouping of individuals into three clusters. A validation study by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed the differential expression of TNFRSF10C, IFNG, PGM5, EBF3, and A2ML1 between the ATB and LTBI groups. Additional clinical validation was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these five biomarkers using 130 subjects. The 3-gene signature set of TNFRSF10C, EBF3, and A2ML1 enabled correct classification of 91.5% of individuals, with a high sensitivity of 86.2% and specificity of 94.9%. Diagnostic performance of the 3-gene signature set was validated using a clinical cohort of 147 subjects with suspected ATB. The sensitivity and specificity of the 3-gene set for ATB were 82.4 and 92.4%, respectively. In conclusion, we detected distinct gene expression patterns in PBMCs stimulated by PPD depending on the status of M. tuberculosis infection. Furthermore, we identified a 3-gene signature set that could distinguish ATB from LTBI, which may facilitate rapid diagnosis and treatment for more effective disease control. © Copyright © 2019 Wang, He, Wu, Zhou, Gao, Chen, Shao, Zhang and Zhang.},

abstract={Objective: To determine the utility of CSF Xpert MTB/RIF (GeneXpert) in diagnosis of tubercular meningitis in children in the age group of 2 mo to 12 y. Methods: This hospital based prospective observational study was conducted at Department of Pediatrics, Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Hubli from December 2015 through November 2016. All children with clinically suspected tuberculous meningitis (TBM) were included in the study. These children underwent a detailed history taking, clinical examination, blood investigations, lumbar puncture and CT brain. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were sent for CSF GeneXpert examination. Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20. Results: A total of 28 children were enrolled in the study. Six (21.4%), 4 (14.3%) and 18 (64.3%) cases were definite, probable and possible TBM cases respectively. Most common age group affected was <5 y (83.33%) with median age 2.5 y (IQR 4.875). Male:female ratio was 1.5:1. CSF GeneXpert was tested positive in 6 cases (21.4%). The sensitivity of the test against the clinical scoring (>/=10) was 46.15% (95% CI, 19.22–74.87) and specificity was 100% (95% CI, 78.20–100). There was a significant association between CSF GeneXpert and Mantoux test (P = 0.002), CSF cell type >50% lymphocytes (P = 0.005) and CSF protein >100 mg/dl (P = 0.025) along with CT hydrocephalus (P = 0.021), granuloma (P = 0.009) and basal exudates (P = 0.025). None of the cases were tested smear positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Conclusions: CSF GeneXpert is superior to smear for AFB in TBM. © 2019, Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) remains among the top 10 infectious diseases with highest mortality globally since the 1990s despite effective chemotherapy. Among 10 million patients that fell ill with tuberculosis in the year 2017, 36 % were undiagnosed or detected and not reported; the number goes as high as 55 % in Tanzania, showing that the diagnosis of TB is a big challenge in the developing countries. There have been great advancements in TB diagnostics with introduction of the molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, lipoarabinomannan urine strip test, and molecular line-probe assays. However, most of the hospitals in Tanzania still rely on the TB score chart in children, the WHO screening questions in adults, acid-fast bacilli and chest x-ray for the diagnosis of TB. Xpert MTB/RIF has been rolled-out but remains a challenge in settings where the samples for testing must be transported over many kilometers. Imaging by sonography - nowadays widely available even in rural settings of Tanzania - has been shown to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Despite all the efforts and new diagnostics, 30-50 % of patients in high-burden TB countries are still empirically treated for tuberculosis. More efforts need to be placed if we are to reduce the death toll by 90 % until 2030. © 2019 Hogrefe.},

abstract={Background: Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a serious protozoal disease endemic in diverse areas, including the southern area of Madrid (Spain), where an outbreak was detected in 2009. The objective of this work is to analyze bone marrow alterations in VL patients and elaborate a diagnostic model with the aim to improve the early detection of this disease. The usual diagnostic methods, as the observation of the parasite on a bone marrow aspirate, have frequent false negatives, and the high sensitivity methods, as PCR and ELISA, are delayed or are not always available. Methods: This observational study evaluated bone marrow parameters of adult patients with clinical suspicion of VL, in which a bone marrow aspiration was performed but Leishmania was not directly observed, during the period 2009-2014. The patients finally diagnosed of VL by other methods (VL group, n=41), and the patients in which the VL was not diagnosed (non-VL group, n=20) were compared. A multivariant model was elaborated and externally validated. Results: The final multivariant model includes percentage of myeloid series, percentage of plasma cells and quantification of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.87 (0.78-0.96). The model performed well in the external validation. Conclusion: In cases of VL suspicion and when the parasite is not observed in the bone marrow aspiration, the proposed model could be useful in discriminating between patients with and without VL, allowing to take a therapeutic decision while awaiting the definitive diagnosis. © 2019 European Federation of Internal Medicine},

abstract={Background: Despite effort to diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected population, 45% of adults with HIV that had a previously unknown reason for death, demonstrated TB was the cause by autopsy examination. We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of implementation a new algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) related sepsis among PLHIV presenting with life-threatening illness. Methods: This study is a prospective cohort conducted in three-referral hospitals in Kilimanjaro, recruited 97 PLHIV from February through June 2018. Patients provided urine and sputum samples for testing lateral flow - lipoarabinomannan (LF-LAM) and Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)/rifampicin (RIF) assays, respectively. Anti-TB was prescribed to patients with positive LF-LAM or Xpert MTB/RIF or received broad-spectrum antibiotics but deteriorated. Results: Of 97 patients, 84 (87%) provided urine and sputa, and 13 (13%) provided only urine. The mean age (95% confidence interval) was 40 (38-43) years and 52 (54%) were female. In 84 patients, LF-LAM increased TB detection from 26 (31%) by Xpert MTB/RIF to 41 (55%) by both tests. Of 97 patients, 69 (71%) prescribed anti-TB, 67% (46/69) and 33% (23/69) had definitive and probable TB respectively. Sixteen (16.5%) patients died, of which one died before treatment, 73% (11/15) died within 7 days of admission. The 30-day survival was similar in both treatment groups (log rank = 0.1574). Mortality was significantly higher among hospitalized patients compared to outpatients (P ≤ 0.027). Conclusion: Implementation of new algorithm increased TB case detection in patients that could have been missed by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Survival of PLHIV with confirmed or probable TB was comparable to those of PLHIV that were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics alone. Further work should focus on the optimal timing and content of the immediate antimicrobial regimen for sepsis among PLHIV in TB-endemic settings.},

abstract={Background: The diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis (TB) can be difficult in severely malnourished children. This is mainly due to the fact of our perceived notion that clinical signs of TB are often subtle in severely malnourished children and we may rely on laboratory investigation for the diagnosis. However, comparative data on the performance of clinical and laboratory diagnostics of TB in such population are also very limited. Objectives: To compare the performance of composite clinical criteria and a technique that measures antibodies in lymphocyte supernatant (ALS) for the diagnosis of TB in severely malnourished children with pneumonia. Methods: Severely malnourished children under five with radiological pneumonia admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh were enrolled consecutively following informed consent. We collected venous blood for ALS, gastric lavage fluid and induced sputum for microscopy, mycobacterial culture, and real-time PCR by Xpert MTB/RIF. We compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values, and accuracy of modified Kenneth Jones criteria (MKJC) score, World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, and ALS in diagnosing TB in severely malnourished children with pneumonia for “Confirmed TB” and “All TB” (“Confirmed TB” plus “Probable TB”) vs. “Not TB.” Results: Compared to culture confirmed TB, the sensitivity, and specificity (95% CI) for MKJC were 60 (27–86) and 84 (79–87)% and for WHO criteria were 40 (14–73) and 84 (80–87)%, respectively. Compared to culture and/or Xpert MTB/RIF positive TB, the sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) for the criteria were 37 (20–58) and 84 (79–87)%; and 22 (9–43) and 83 (79–87)%, respectively. For both these comparisons, the sensitivity and specificity of ALS were 50 (14–86) and 60 (53–67)%, respectively. Conclusion: Our data suggest that WHO criteria and MKJC scoring mainly based on clinical criteria are more useful than ALS in diagnosing TB in young severely malnourished children with pneumonia. The results underscore the importance of using clinical criteria for the diagnosis of TB in severely malnourished children that may help to minimize the chance of over treatment with anti-TB in such population, especially in resource limited TB endemic settings. © Copyright © 2019 Chisti, Shahid, Shahunja, Banu, Raqib, Shahrin, Islam, Sharifuzzaman, Saha, Alam, Rahman, Nuzhat, Afroze, Sarmin and Ahmed.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) remains a worldwide scourge and the most common cause of mortality from infectious disease. Around 95% of cases occur in developing country. Renal TB is a rare cases that complicates 3-4% of pulmonary TB patients and commonly overlooked in clinical practice due to its symptoms may mimic other diseases.A-39-year-old man was admitted to our institution due to flank pain. He had history of low grade fever and oligouria since 5 months prior. He had no complaint of cough, dyspnea, or night sweat. He was a non smoker and had no past medical history of tuberculosis. Previous 4 months abdominal ultrasound showed left pelvocaliectasis and ureteral dilatation with suspicion of left ureteral stenosis. Ureterolithiasis could not be excluded. No prostate enlargement or vesicolithiasis was seen. Intravenous pyelography (IVP) examination demonstrated similar finding. Initial laboratory blood examination showed anemia (10.7 g/dl), leukocytosis (14,080/ul), increased in serum creatinin (4.2 mg/dl), ureum (227 mg/dl), and calcium (6.78 mg/dl). Serology examinations were negative for HIV, HBsAg, anti HCV and blood culture had no growth. Urinary examination revealed severe leucocyturia, hematuria, and negative for bacteria, nitrite and cast. Urine culture was positive for Candida glabrata. Pulmonary X-ray suggested right pleural fibrotic. He was initially diagnosed as multiple myeloma with fungal infection. Nevertheless, additional peripheral blood smear showed neither rouleaux formation nor blast. He underwent percutaneous nephrostomy and got micafungin intravenously. Instead of improving, the patient deteriorated and transferred to intensive room. We then explored the possibility of TB infection. Further examination revealed positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in urinary polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Tracheal sputum examination was positive for acid fast bacilli staining. There was low level of serum vitamin D2 (5.8 ng/ml). He got TB treatment with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Unfortunately, the patient eventually succumbed.},

abstract={Tuberculous effusion is a common disease entity with a spectrum of presentations from a largely benign effusion, which resolves completely, to a complicated effusion with loculations, pleural thickening and even frank empyema, all of which may have a lasting effect on lung function. The pathogenesis is a combination of true pleural infection and an effusive hypersensitivity reaction, compartmentalized within the pleural space. Diagnostic thoracentesis with thorough pleural fluid analysis including biomarkers such as adenosine deaminase and gamma interferon achieves high accuracy in the correct clinical context. Definitive diagnosis may require invasive procedures to demonstrate histological evidence of caseating granulomas or microbiological evidence of the organism on smear or culture. Drug resistance is an emerging problem that requires vigilance and extra effort to acquire a complete drug sensitivity profile for each tuberculous effusion treated. Nucleic acid amplification tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF can be invaluable in this instance; however, the yield is low in pleural fluid. Treatment consists of standard anti-tuberculous therapy or a guideline-based individualized regimen in the case of drug resistance. There is low-quality evidence that suggests possible benefit from corticosteroids; however, they are not currently recommended due to concomitant increased risk of adverse effects. Small studies report some short- and long-term benefit from interventions such as therapeutic thoracentesis, intrapleural fibrinolytics and surgery but many questions remain to be answered. © 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology},

abstract={Background: Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is prevalent in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. The risk of tuberculosis activation is also high. The appropriate LTBI screening and treatment is required in this population. Meanwhile, whether hemodialysis adequacy is associated with LTBI in the ESRD population is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between hemodialysis adequacy and LTBI in ESRD patients. Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, we reviewed all outpatient-based ESRD patients in our artificial kidney room. Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) was used for the diagnosis of LTBI. Clinical variables including nutritional adequacy (i.e., normalized protein catabolic rate, nPCR) and dialysis adequacy (i.e., Kt/V) were compared between IGRA-positive and IGRA-negative patients. Results: A total of 90 patients were enrolled, of which 20 (22.2%) had positive IGRA results using the QuantiFERON-TB method. Old fibrotic changes and nPCR (g/kg/day) were significantly different between IGRA-positive and IGRA-negative patients (both p < 0.005), while serum albumin and Kt/V were comparable (p = 0.429 and p = 0.590, respectively). Normalized PCR remained to be significant in a multivariate logistic regression analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.911 (0.861-0.963); p = 0.001). The cutoff nPCR value less than 0.87 g/kg/day had an adjusted hazard ratio of 7.74 (1.77-33.74) for predicting LTBI. Patients with nPCR value less than 0.87 g/kg/day were older and had lower serum hemoglobin, albumin, calcium concentration, and Kt/V levels than those with nPCR value greater than 0.87 g/kg/day. Conclusions: Nutritional adequacy, especially when assessing nPCR value, was associated with LTBI, while dialysis adequacy was not associated with LTBI. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={The present study was aimed to assess the prevalence and efficiency of techniques for the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Gamma interferon assay (IFN-γ) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in comparison to skin tuberculin test and culture technique. A total of 2600 cross-breed dairy cattle in Menoufia and Daqahlia governorates were tested by the single intradermal tuberculin test where the disease prevalence was 1.8%. Serum and whole blood samples were collected from positive tuberculin reactors for ELISA and IFN-γ assay, respectively. After slaughtering of positive tuberculin reactors, the post-mortem examination was carried out and tissue samples were collected for the bacteriological examination and PCR. The percentage of visible lesions of tuberculin reactors was 78.7%, while non-visible lesions were 21.27%. Culture technique revealed that the percentage of bTB was 63.8%. The ELISA and IFN-γ assay using short-term culture filtrate (ST-CF) prepared antigen revealed higher sensitivity (72.3% and 82.9%) than the bovine purified protein derivative (PPD-B) antigen. Although prepared ST-CF antigen has great efficiency and eligibility for the diagnosis of bTB, PCR appeared to have a higher sensitivity (85.1%) than other diagnostic methods when dealing with post-mortem samples.

abstract={Accurate determination of microRNA expression levels is a prerequisite in using these small non-coding RNA molecules as novel biomarkers in disease diagnosis and prognosis. Quantitative PCR is the method of choice for measuring the expression levels of microRNAs. However, a major obstacle that affects the reliability of results is the lack of validated reference controls for data normalization. Various non-coding RNAs have previously been used as reference controls, but their use may lead to variations and lack of comparability of microRNA data among the studies. Despite the growing number of studies investigating microRNA profiles to discriminate between healthy and disease stages, robust reference controls for data normalization have so far not been established. In the present article, we provide an overview of different reference controls used in various diseases, and highlight the urgent need for the identification of suitable reference controls to produce reliable data. Our analysis shows, among others, that RNU6 is not an ideal normalizer in studies using patient material from different diseases. Finally, our article tries to disclose the challenges to find a reference control which is uniformly and stably expressed across all body tissues, fluids, and diseases. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is the world’s leading cause of death from infectious disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized 6.3 million new TB cases in 2017, 16% corresponding to extrapulmonary forms; pleural tuberculosis (PT) is the most common extrapulmonary form in adults. PT diagnosis is often challenging because the scarcity of bacilli in pleural fluid (PF), sometimes requiring invasive procedures to obtain pleural tissue for histological, microbiological or molecular examination. In regions of medium and high disease prevalence, adenosine deaminase (ADA), interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin 27 (IL-27) dosages are useful to establish presumptive diagnosis in patients with compatible clinical/radiological picture who present with lymphocytic pleural effusion. PT treatment is similar to the pulmonary TB treatment regimen recommended by WHO. Area covered: In this update, we present a PT review, including epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and therapy. Expert opinion: There is no PF test alone accurate for PT diagnosis, despite the evolution in clinical laboratory. ADA, IFN-γ and IL-27 are valuable laboratory biomarkers; however, IFN-γ and IL-27 are quite expensive. Molecular tests present low sensitivity in PF, being useful for diagnostic confirmation. Multidrug therapy remains the PT treatment choice. Advancing research in immunotherapy may bring benefits to PT patients. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Introduction: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and death worldwide, and disproportionally affects people with HIV. Many cases still remain undiagnosed, and rapid and effective screening strategies are needed to control the TB epidemics. Immunological biomarkers may contribute. Methods: Plasma samples from healthy individuals (n: 12) and from HIV-infected individuals with (n: 21) and without pulmonary TB (n: 122) were tested for C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, and interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10). Increased levels of biomarkers and WHO 4-symptom-screening were compared with the presence of pulmonary TB. Survival status at 12 months was recorded. Associations with CD4 count, BMI, haemoglobin, disease severity, and mortality were analysed. Results: The plasma levels of the biomarkers were significantly higher in TB-positive (n:21) compared to TB-negative (n:122) subjects. WHO symptoms, increased neopterin (>10 nmol/L) and CRP (>10 mg/L) showed similar sensitivity and different specificity, with increased CRP showing higher and increased neopterin lower specificity. The three markers were inversely correlated to haemoglobin and to CD4, and CRP levels inversely correlated to BMI. The markers were also significantly higher in individuals with subsequent mortality and in individuals with higher mycobacterial load in sputum according to Xpert results (IP-10 and CRP). Conclusion: This study showed significant associations of the biomarkers analysed with TB infection and mortality, that could have potential clinical relevance. Biomarker levels may be included in operational research on TB screening and diagnosis. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem worldwide, especially in developing countries. In 2015, there are estimated 950,000 cases of childhood TB. Since most TB in children is paucibacillary, this gives rise not only to problem in diagnosing but also in monitoring the response to anti-TB treatment as well. Soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein of various cells of immune system, is one of the potential biomarkers to be used in the management of TB. The objective of this study is to study the decrease of serum suPAR level after anti-TB treatment in children with TB and its association with patient characteristics. Methods: We conducted a prospective study on children suspected of having TB due to a history of contact with active TB case and symptoms such as coughing, fever, and enlarged lymph nodes. The diagnosis of TB is established by history, physical examination including anthropometric examination. Tuberculin skin test using PPD RT-23 and interferon-gamma releasing assay with Quantiferon TB-Gold Plus was performed. Chest X-rays were read by two independent radiologists. Microbiological examination was performed using microscopic examination and Xpert MTB/RIF. The level of suPAR before and after anti-TB treatment was examined with the Elisa method. Results: There was no significant difference of serum suPAR levels before and after anti-TB treatment (mean 0.71 [standard deviation 0.585] ng/mL; P = 0.072). There was no association between ages (P = 0.112), nutritional status (P = 0.228), diagnosis of pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB (P = 0.956), and radiological feature (P = 0.810) with serum suPAR levels decrease. Conclusion: There is no suPAR serum level decrease 2 months after treatment with anti-TB and there is no association with age, nutritional status, pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB diagnosis, and radiological feature. © 2019 International Journal of Mycobacteriology | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.},

abstract={Background: In high-burden settings, case fatality rates are reported to be between 11% and 32% in hospitalized patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, yet the underlying causes of mortality remain poorly characterized. Understanding causes of mortality could inform the development of novel management strategies to improve survival. We aimed to assess clinical and microbiologic determinants of mortality and to characterize the pathophysiological processes underlying death by evaluating host soluble inflammatory mediators and determined the relationship between these mediators and death as well as biomarkers of disseminated tuberculosis. Methods and findings: Adult patients with HIV hospitalized with a new diagnosis of HIV-associated tuberculosis were enrolled in Cape Town between 2014 and 2016. Detailed tuberculosis diagnostic testing was performed. Biomarkers of tuberculosis dissemination and host soluble inflammatory mediators at baseline were assessed. Of 682 enrolled participants, 576 with tuberculosis (487/576, 84.5% microbiologically confirmed) were included in analyses. The median age was 37 years (IQR = 31–43), 51.2% were female, and the patients had advanced HIV with a median cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count of 58 cells/L (IQR = 21–120) and a median HIV viral load of 5.1 log10 copies/mL (IQR = 3.3–5.7). Antituberculosis therapy was initiated in 566/576 (98.3%) and 487/576 (84.5%) started therapy within 48 hours of enrolment. Twelve-week mortality was 124/576 (21.5%), with 46/124 (37.1%) deaths occurring within 7 days of enrolment. Clinical and microbiologic determinants of mortality included disseminated tuberculosis (positive urine lipoarabinomannan [LAM], urine Xpert MTB/RIF, or tuberculosis blood culture in 79.6% of deaths versus 60.7% of survivors, p = 0.001), sepsis syndrome (high lactate in 50.8% of deaths versus 28.9% of survivors, p &lt; 0.001), and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (16.9% of deaths versus 7.2% of survivors, p = 0.002). Using non-supervised two-way hierarchical cluster and principal components analyses, we describe an immune profile dominated by mediators of the innate immune system and chemotactic signaling (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1Ra], IL-6, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta [MIP-1β]/C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 [CCL4], interferon gamma-induced protein-10 [IP-10]/C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 [CXCL10], MIP-1 alpha [MIP-1α]/CCL3), which segregated participants who died from those who survived. This immune profile was associated with mortality in a Cox proportional hazards model (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.2, 95%CI = 1.9–2.7, p &lt; 0.001) and with detection of biomarkers of disseminated tuberculosis. Clinicians attributing causes of death identified tuberculosis as a cause or one of the major causes of death in 89.5% of cases. We did not perform longitudinal sampling and did not have autopsy-confirmed causes of death. Conclusions: In this study, we did not identify a major contribution from coinfections to these deaths. Disseminated tuberculosis, sepsis syndrome, and rifampicin resistance were associated with mortality. An immune profile dominated by mediators of the innate immune system and chemotactic signaling was associated with both tuberculosis dissemination and mortality. These findings provide pathophysiologic insights into underlying causes of mortality and could be used to inform the development of novel treatment strategies and to develop methods to risk stratify patients to appropriately target novel interventions. Causal relationships cannot be established from this study. © 2019 Schutz et al.},

abstract={Aim: Long intergenic noncoding RNAs are long noncoding transcripts from the intergenic regions of annotated protein-coding genes. The elevated expression of long noncoding RNA (lnRNA) LOC152742 has been found in tuberculosis infection yet its roles in antimycobacterial responses remain to be elucidated. Patients and methods: In this study, the expression levels of LOC152742 in sputum, plasma of normal individuals, active tuberculosis patients, obsolete tuberculosis patients, and individuals affected with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the sensitivity and specificity of the candidate biomarker LOC152742 were obtained. At the same time, the expression levels of LOC152742 in pulmonary epithelial and macrophages cells infected with H37Ra or H37Rv were detected by qRT-PCR. Results: LOC152742 in sputum and plasma had a higher specificity in active tuberculosis compared with that in obsolete tuberculosis and BCG patients. Additionally, LOC152742 in pulmonary epithelial cells macrophages infected with H37Ra or H37Rv was increased significantly compared with uninfected groups indicating that LOC152742 may potentially act as a novel biomarker for diagnosis and therapy of active tuberculosis. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Individuals with cryptococcal antigenemia are at high risk of developing cryptococcal meningitis if untreated. The progression and timing from asymptomatic infection to cryptococcal meningitis is unclear. We describe a subpopulation of individuals with neurologic symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia but negative cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) studies. Methods: We evaluated 1201 human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive individuals hospitalized with suspected meningitis in Kampala and Mbarara, Uganda. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of participants with neurologic-symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia and negative CSF cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) were compared to participants with confirmed CSF CrAg+ cryptococcal meningitis. Additional CSF testing included microscopy, fungal culture, bacterial culture, tuberculosis culture, multiplex FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Biofire), and Xpert MTB/Rif. Results: We found 56% (671/1201) of participants had confirmed CSF CrAg+ cryptococcal meningitis and 4% (54/1201) had neurologic symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia with negative CSF CrAg. Of those with negative CSF CrAg, 9% (5/54) had Cryptococcus isolated on CSF culture (n = 3) or PCR (n = 2) and 11% (6/54) had confirmed tuberculous meningitis. CSF CrAg-negative patients had lower proportions with CSF pleocytosis (16% vs 26% with ≥5 white cells/μL) and CSF opening pressure &gt;200 mmH2O (16% vs 71%) compared with CSF CrAg-positive patients. No cases of bacterial or viral meningitis were detected by CSF PCR or culture. In-hospital mortality was similar between symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia (32%) and cryptococcal meningitis (31%; P =. 91). Conclusions: Cryptococcal antigenemia with meningitis symptoms was the third most common meningitis etiology. We postulate this is early cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. Fluconazole monotherapy was suboptimal despite Cryptococcus-negative CSF. Further studies are warranted to understand the clinical course and optimal management of this distinct entity. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={The emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB; defined as resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid) represents a growing threat to public health and economic growth. Never before in the history of mankind have more patients been affected by MDRTB than is the case today. The World Health Organization reports that MDR-TB outcomes are poor despite staggeringly high management costs. Moreover, treatment is prolonged, adverse events are common, and the majority of affected patients do not receive adequate treatment. As MDR-TB strains are often resistant to one or more second-line anti-TB drugs, in-depth genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing is needed to construct personalised treatment regimens to improve treatment outcomes. For the first time in decades, the availability of novel drugs such as bedaquiline allow us to design potent and well-tolerated personalised MDR-TB treatment regimens based solely on oral drugs. In this article, we present management guidance to optimise the diagnosis, algorithm-based treatment, drug dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring, and the management of adverse events and comorbidities, associated with MDRTB. We also discuss the role of surgery, physiotherapy, rehabilitation, palliative care and smoking cessation in patients with MDR-TB. We hope that incorporating these recommendations into patient care will be helpful in optimising treatment outcomes, and lead to more MDRTB patients achieving a relapse-free cure. © 2019 The Union.},

abstract={The diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis is a challenge due to the pauci-bacillary nature of infection and the difficulty in obtaining appropriate sample. In the past 2–3 decades, many new tests were introduced for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and some of them have been evaluated for their application in pediatric tuberculosis as well. There is an attempt to improve smear microscopy by introducing light-emitting diode (LED) fluorescence microscopy and there are also some automated digital microscopy platforms under evaluation. Introduction of automated liquid culture platform along with rapid molecular based identification methods have considerably reduced the time delay in mycobacterial culture. Recent addition of many nucleic acid amplification platforms like Amplicor PCR, Genprobe, Xpert MTB/Rif, line probe assays, loop mediated isothermal amplification etc are also been found to be useful. Latest techniques like microarray and gene sequencing are also being used in clinical laboratories with variable results. Indirect methods of TB diagnosis like T cell based assays including tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assays have their role primarily in the diagnosis of latent TB. Biomarkers are the latest addition in the battery of TB diagnostic tests facilitating diagnosis using easily accessible samples like urine, blood and breath of patients. Many biomarkers are still under evaluation and some of them are found to have a potential role as promising diagnostic tests of future. © 2019, Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.},

abstract={MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNA molecules which are involved in various cellular and physiological processes. Previously, studies have identified several miRNAs that are potential diagnostic biomarkers for various infectious diseases including tuberculosis. We have performed small RNA sequencing using the Ion Torrent PGM platform in extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) subject's serum samples to identify circulating miRNAs during mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. Our analysis identified 20 circulating miRNAs upregulated and 5 miRNAs downregulated during MTB infection in patient's serum. In addition, we have identified 6 MTB genome encoded miRNAs upregulated in EPTB patient's serum samples. Taqman based qRT-PCR analysis of host-genome encoded (hsa-miR-146a-5p and hsa-miR-125b-5p) and MTB genome encoded (MTB-miR5) miRNAs showed increased expression in a cohort of 52 healthy, pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) patients serum samples. Our study identified for the first time a panel of host and MTB genome specific differentially expressed circulating miRNAs in serum samples of an Indian patient cohort with tuberculosis infection with a potential as a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for tuberculosis infection. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Spinal tuberculosis is a common form of extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis. Among them tubercular involvement of the lumbosacral region or isolated involvement of sacram is very rare presentation. Aim of the work: The aim of this case presentation is to describe two rare cases of Pott’s disease which clinically mimicked spinal tumor. Case report: A 60-year-old hypertensive, diabetic male patient admitted with low back pain radiating to both lower limbs for 7 months along with low grade fever, generalized weakness and weight loss for the same duration. Clinically, patient had features of flaccid paraparesis, tenderness at the lumbosacral junction, restricted SLR on both sides. There was no features of autonomic dysfunction. MRI of lumbosacral spine showed infective spondylodiscitis at L4 to S1 level with collapse of L5 vertebrae along with paravertebral and epidural abscess. Diagnosis was confirmed by CT guided FNAC from the lesion. Next case was a 23-year-old male patient presented with back pain and walking difficulty for 5 months with some constitutional symptoms.MRI of the dorsal spine with whole spine screening showed multifocal skipped lesion involving whole spine with presence of huge pre-sacral collection. Percutaneous transpedicular aspiration of the purulent material under C-Arm guidance was done and tuberculous infection confirmed by Gene Xpert. Conclusion: Though sacral tuberculosis is rare presentation of Pott’s disease but it should be considered as one of the differential diagnosis in any lytic lesion involving the sacrum in perspective of our country. © 2019, Ibn Sina Trust.

abstract={RATIONALE: We present a rare case of multiple tuberculous mycotic aneurysm. Multiple aneurysms caused by tuberculosis (TB) are difficult to treat. Here, we discuss a treatment modality using a microcore stent graft. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 73-year-old man with pain in the back and on the right side of the chest associated with dry cough, presented with an inability to walk since 1-month. DIAGNOSES: A diagnosis of multiple aneurysms caused by TB was made, based on computed tomography (CT) scan and positive T-spot and Xpert tests. INTERVENTIONS: We administered the empirical anti-TB regimen (pyrazinamide, isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol) and performed endovascular repair using microcore stent graft. OUTCOMES: The post-operative hemodynamic analysis indicated that the patient's aneurysms no longer had a risk of rupture, and blood flow in the major branches of the aorta had been maintained. However, the patient could not survive due to a pulmonary infection acquired during recuperation at a local hospital. LESSONS: For multiple tuberculous mycotic aneurysms, anti-TB therapy is inadequate and the microcore stent graft is a feasible option that can improve the hemodynamics in the aneurysms.},

abstract={Background: Timely diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) remains challenging. Molecular diagnostic tools are necessary, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. There is no approved commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that can be used to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis in non-respiratory samples, such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We aimed to validate the threshold cycle (Ct) cut-off points; calculate the operational characteristics of real-time PCR for detection of M. tuberculosis (MTb qPCR) in the CSF; and the inhibitory affect of CSF red blood cells (RBC) and total proteins on MTb qPCR. Methods: A total of 334 consecutive participants were enrolled. Based on clinical, laboratory and imaging data, cases of suspected TBM were categorized as definite, probable, possible or not TBM cases. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to select the best discriminating Ct value. Results: For TBM cases categorized as definite or probable (n = 21), the Ct validated for CSF (≤39.5) improved the diagnostic performance of MTb qPCR on CSF samples. The sensitivity was 29%, specificity was 95%, positive predictive value was 26%, negative predictive value was 95%, efficiency was 90% and positive likelihood was 5.3. The CSF RBC and total protein did not affect the positivity of the MTb qPCR. Conclusions: These data support the validation of a highly specific but low sensitive MTb qPCR assay for the TBM diagnosis using CSF samples. MTb qPCR contributes significantly to the diagnosis, mainly when associated with conventional microbiology tests and clinical algorithms. © 2019 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

abstract={Background: Many countries are facing overlapping epidemics of tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM). Diabetes increases the overall risk of developing Tuberculosis (TB) and contributes to adverse treatment outcomes. Active screening for both diseases can reduce TB transmission and prevent the development of complications of DM. We investigated bi-directional TB-DM screening in Karachi, Pakistan, a country that ranks fifth among high TB burden countries, and has the seventh highest country burden for DM. Methods: Between February to November 2014, community-based screeners identified presumptive TB and DM through verbal screening at private health clinics. Individuals with presumptive TB were referred for a chest X-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF. Presumptive DM cases had random blood glucose (RBS) tested. All individuals with bacteriologically positive TB were referred for diabetes testing (RBS). All pre-diabetics and diabetics were referred for a chest X-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF test. The primary outcomes of this study were uptake of TB and DM testing. Results: A total of 450,385 individuals were screened, of whom 18,109 had presumptive DM and 90,137 had presumptive TB. 14,550 of these individuals were presumptive for both DM and TB. The uptake of DM testing among those with presumptive diabetes was 26.1% while the uptake of TB testing among presumptive TB cases was 5.9%. Despite efforts to promote bi-directional screening of TB and DM, the uptake of TB testing among pre-diabetes and diabetes cases was only 4.7%, while the uptake of DM testing among MTB positive cases was 21.8%. Conclusion: While a high yield for TB was identified among pre-diabetics and diabetics along with a high yield of DM among individuals diagnosed with TB, there was a low uptake of TB testing amongst presumptive TB patients who were recorded as pre-diabetic or diabetic. Bi-directional screening for TB and DM which includes the integration of TB diagnostics, DM screening and TB-DM treatment within existing health care programs will need to address the operational challenges identified before implementing this as a strategy in public health programs. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Quantitated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) H37Rv DNA was used to analyse the sensitivity and the specificity was assessed using DNA isolated from the reference strain H37Rv, 12 nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) species and five nonmycobacterium species. Furthermore, performance of the assay was evaluated on the sputum samples and compared with smear microscopy, culture and PCR. mpt64 (also called mpb64 or Rv1980c) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) successfully detected 1 pg DNA within 40 min and successfully rejected NTMs and other bacterial species tested. It specifically detected all the 119 confirmed TB cases and 100 of the 104 control cases. The resulting sensitivity and specificity of LAMP assay was found to be 100% (95% CI: 96·79–100%) and 96·15% (95% CI; 90·44–98·94%) respectively. Significance and Impact of the Study: Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a technique for isothermal DNA amplification suitable for cost-limited settings as it prevents the use of sophisticated instruments. Using mpt64 antigenic protein gene, we developed a LAMP assay especially for organisms of the M. tuberculosis complex. mpt64 LAMP assay showed 100% sensitivity and detected all the bacteriologically and clinically positive TB cases not detected by smear, culture or PCR methods. © 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology},

abstract={Tuberculosis is the leading infectious cause of death globally and extra-pulmonary disease occurs in 15% of incident cases annually. Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is arguably the most lethal form of tuberculosis and requires prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment to prevent death and serious neurological disability. The development of rapid diagnostic tests using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), including the World Health Organization (WHO) – endorsed Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay, has allowed earlier definite diagnosis of TBM than conventional culture methods which usually take two weeks or longer for positive identification of MTB. Detection of MTB in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using PCR assays requires special attention to the collection, handling, and processing of CSF. Herein we present best practices guidance to maximize the detection rate of MTB in CSF using Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra. © 2019},

abstract={Background: Making a definite diagnosis of infectious uveitis is a challenging task because many other infectious, and non-infectious uveitis, may have similar non-specific symptoms and overlapping clinical appearances. Co-infections in immunocompetent patients are not frequently proved with traditional serologic-diagnostic tools. Methods: Descriptive transversal study, in a Uveitis Service of an Ophthalmology Reference Center, in Bogotá, Colombia, from July 2014 to February 2016. Aqueous humor (AH) and/or vitreous fluid, blood and serum samples were collected from consecutive patients suspected of having infectious uveitis. The diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) was confirmed by the Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (GWC) and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Differential diagnosis by PCR in AH was done for viral origin such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Results: In 66 Colombian patients with uveitis of presumed infectious origin: 22 (33.3%) were confirmed as OT, 16 (24.2%) as undetermined OT, five (7.5%) as co-infections and 23 (34.8%) as other uveitis. Toxoplasma coinfection with M. tuberculosis was identified in one case by PCR and in four cases with HSV by GWC. The initial clinical diagnosis changed, after laboratory examination, in 21 cases (31.8%). Conclusions: Clinical diagnosis can be changed by laboratory examination in a significant proportion of cases of uveitis. Diagnosis of OT should combine the use of PCR and GWC to reach the maximum of confirmation of cases. The use of multiple laboratory methods is necessary to identify co-infections and viral infections that can mimic OT in immunocompetent patients. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background. Knowledge of causes of sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. A better understanding of the microbiology of bloodstream infections could improve outcomes. Methods. We used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based TaqMan Array Card (TAC) to directly test for 43 targets from whole blood. We analyzed 336 cryopreserved specimens from adult Ugandans with sepsis enrolled in a multisite study; 84% were infected with human immunodeficiency virus. We compared qPCR TAC results with blood culture and determined the association of qPCR with study participant outcomes using logistic regression. Results. The most frequently detected targets were cytomegalovirus (CMV, n = 139, 41%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB, n = 70, 21%), Plasmodium (n = 35, 10%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 31, 9%). Diagnostic performance varied by target with qPCR sensitivity averaging 61 ± 28% and specificity 98 ± 3% versus culture. In multivariable analysis, independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included CMV viremia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-5.5; p < .01) and TB qPCR-positivity, whether blood culture-positive (aOR 4.6, 95% CI, 2.1-10.0; p < .01) or blood culture-negative (aOR 2.9, 95% CI, 1.2-6.9; p = .02). Conclusions. Using qPCR TAC on direct blood specimens, CMV and TB were the most commonly identified targets and were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality. qPCR TAC screening of blood for multiple targets may be useful to guide triage and treatment of sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa. © The Author(s) 2018.

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant, yet under-recognized cause of death in the pediatric population, with a WHO estimate of 1 million new cases of childhood TB in 2016 resulting in 250,000 deaths. Diagnosis is notoriously difficult; manifestations are protean due to the high proportion of cases of extra-pulmonary TB in children, and logistical problems exist in obtaining suitable specimens. These issues are compounded by the paucibacillary nature of disease with the result that an estimated 96% of pediatric TB-associated mortality occurs prior to commencing anti-tuberculous treatment. Further development of sensitive, rapid diagnostic tests and their incorporation into diagnostic algorithms is vital in this population, and central to the WHO End-TB strategy. Initial gains were made with the expansion of nucleic acid amplification technology, particularly the introduction of the GeneXpert fully-automated PCR Xpert MTB/Rif assay in 2010, and more recently, the Xpert MTB/Rif Ultra (Ultra) assay in 2017. Ultra provides increased analytical sensitivity when compared with the initial Xpert assay in vitro; a finding now also supported by six clinical studies to date, two of which included pediatric samples. Here, we review the published evidence for the performance of Ultra in TB diagnosis in children, as well as studies in adults with paucibacillary disease providing results relevant to the pediatric population. Following on from this, we speculate upon future directions for Ultra, with focus on its potential use with alternative diagnostic specimens, which may be of particular utility in children. © 2019 Atherton, Cresswell, Ellis, Kitaka and Boulware.},

abstract={The objective: to study the efficacy of etiological verification of tuberculosis in case of systemic inflammation syndrome in HIV patients. Subjects and methods. 116 HIV patients were examined; all of them were admitted to hospital due to systemic inflammatory syndrome (SIS). In order to diagnose tuberculosis, clinical, bacteriological, and instrumental examinations were performed. Specimens of venous blood were used for the detection of tuberculous mycobacteria by RT-PCR and culture. Results. More than half (64.6%) of cases of systemic inflammatory syndrome in the examined HIV patients was due to tuberculosis onset. The degree of immunity suppression (considering CD4 count) in SIS patients with tuberculosis onset and various HIV-associated pathologies was not statistically significantly different. The frequency of MTB DNA detection by RT-PCR in venous blood in case of verified tuberculous sepsis (non-academic term) in TB/HIV patients made 29.3%, and taking into account positive results of blood culture in 5 patients with no MTB DNA found in the blood, the efficiency of diagnosis of tuberculosis in blood specimens reached 33.3%, while efficiency of blood cultures for MTB made 36.0%, with 100% specificity. Repeated PCR tests and blood cultures performed in some patients allowed increasing the total efficiency of blood tests. © 2019 New Terra Publishing House. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Aim: The aim of this study is to compare the results of nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for early detection of genital tuberculosis (GTB) using menstrual blood (MB) and endometrial tissue (ET) as samples in females presenting as infertility. Methods: The ET and MB samples were collected from a total of 194 females, enrolled in this study. DNA isolation from samples was done using standard, phenol-chloroform method. Heat shock protein gene (hsp65/groEL2) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was targeted and amplified, and the final products were analyzed. Results: Overall, 126 (65%) cases of infertility were positive for M. tuberculosis complex by nested PCR. The detection rates in the two samples were statistically insignificant. The combined positivity rate of ET and MB, when compared with positivity rate in MB showed a positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 100%, 68.7%, and 84%, respectively. The results of nested PCR using MB as sample alone showed good agreement with the nested PCR results of the combined samples. Conclusions: The hsp65 Nested PCR of MB can be used as a noninvasive screening test for early diagnosis of GTB. © 2019 Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences.},

Although rare, TB should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cysts of the thigh, especially in endemic areas. We report the case of an 80-year-old female presented with cyst with purulent discharge in her lateral left thigh that was persistent to other surgical and antibiotic treatments. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed positive results for TB. Anti-tubercular therapy had promising results. Our case serves to highlight the importance of considering a reactivated TB infection in individuals with chronic discharge, especially if symptoms are not classic or fail to respond to conventional therapy.

abstract={Understanding risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) and their prevalence helps guide early diagnosis. We determined their prevalence among bacteriologically negative and bacteriologically confirmed TB patients in five regional referral hospitals in Uganda. This cross-sectional study considered 1,862 adult presumptive TB participants. We performed fluorescent microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), Lowenstein-Jensen culture, human immunodeficiency virus, and random blood sugar testing on recruited patients. Prevalence and prevalence ratios of risk factors were compared among bacteriologically negative and confirmed cases. Odds ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined for significant risk factors in bacteriologically confirmed patients. Of the 1,862 participants, 978 (55%) were male and the median age of the participants was 36 years (interquartile range: 27-48). Up to 273 (15%) had a positive result on all three TB tests. Most prevalent risk factors (prevalence ratio [PR] > 1.0) among bacteriologically negative and positive TB patients were cigarette smoking (9.3% versus 2.1%; PR = 2.1), biosmoke (24% versus 39.7%; PR = 1.7), contact (4.2% versus 6.5%; PR = 1.6), male gender (51.4% versus 72.5%; PR = 1.4), alcohol use (17.2% versus 24.4%; PR = 1.4), diabetes (0.7% versus 0.9%; PR = 1.3), and family history of TB (12.1% versus 13.7%; PR = 1.1). The risk factors and their adjusted prevalence rate ratios (95% CI) of being bacteriologically positive were male (1.8 [1.4-2.4]), biosmoke exposure (1.5 [1.2-2.0]), and history of cigarette smoking (1.6 [1.1-2.4]). Among bacteriologically confirmed patients in Uganda, cigarette smoking, biosmoke exposure, contact, male gender, alcohol use, diabetes, and family history of TB are important risk factors for TB. Interventions for TB control in people with these risk factors would help in TB control efforts. © 2019 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.},

abstract={In this study the detection of Mycobacterium bovis with classical and molecular techniques and comparisons of the test results in the thirty slaughtered cattle positive to intradermal tuberculin test (PPD) was aimed. The classical methods include macroscopic examination of the organs, microscopic examination of tissues and blood samples that were stained by HE, ZN, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry and PCR as molecular investigation. Characteristic tubercle development was observed in 26 animals’ macroscopic examination yet 27 and 20 cases were found compatible with tuberculosis in HE and ZN respectively. Tuberculosis positive results were also obtained from lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes and liver via immunohistochemistry (IHC), PCR tissue , immunocytochemistry of the buffy coat (ICC bc) and PCR of the buffy coat (PCR bc ) in 26, 18, 3 and 14 cows respectively. The agents were observed extracytoplasmically and intracytoplasmically in macrophages, giant cells, lymphocytes and fibrocytes in IHC. ICC bc positivity was observed within the cytoplasm of mononuclear leukocytes. Furthermore, the agent was not always detected via ZN staining, which verifies the necessity of ancillary tests. Among these methods IHC has revealed significant sensitivity compared to those of PCR bc and ICC bc (Mc nemar; p&lt;0.05 ve 0.01 respectively), and exhibited compatibility with HE and ZN (Cohen kappa; p&lt;0.001 and 0.05 respectively). These results confirm the fact that rather than one single golden technique, combination of various techniques is necessary for accurate and rapid diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. It has also been concluded that further investigation is necessary to clarify the efficient routine usage of molecular techniques (PCR tissue/bc ) in place of other diagnostic techniques. © 2019, Chartered Inst. of Building Services Engineers.

abstract={HIV-infected individuals are at high risk of tuberculosis disease and those with prior tuberculosis episodes are at even higher risk of disease recurrence. A non-sputum biomarker that identifies individuals at highest tuberculosis risk would allow targeted microbiological testing and appropriate treatment and also guide need for prolonged therapy. We determined the utility of a previously developed whole blood transcriptomic correlate of risk (COR) signature for (1) predicting incident recurrent tuberculosis, (2) tuberculosis diagnosis and (3) its potential utility for tuberculosis treatment monitoring in HIV-infected individuals. We retrieved cryopreserved blood specimens from three previously completed clinical studies and measured the COR signature by quantitative microfluidic real-time-PCR. The signature differentiated recurrent tuberculosis progressors from non-progressors within 3 months of diagnosis with an area under the Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-0.85) amongst HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Twenty-five of 43 progressors (58%) were asymptomatic at microbiological diagnosis and thus had subclinical disease. The signature showed excellent diagnostic discrimination between HIV-uninfected tuberculosis cases and controls (AUC 0.97; 95%CI 0.94-1). Performance was lower in HIV-infected individuals (AUC 0.83; 95%CI 0.81-0.96) and signature scores were directly associated with HIV viral loads. Tuberculosis treatment response in HIV-infected individuals on ART with a new recurrent tuberculosis diagnosis was also assessed. Signature scores decreased significantly during treatment. However, pre-treatment scores could not differentiate between those who became sputum negative before and after 2 months. Direct application of the unmodified blood transcriptomic COR signature detected subclinical and active tuberculosis by blind validation in HIV-infected individuals. However, prognostic performance for recurrent tuberculosis, and performance as diagnostic and as treatment monitoring tool in HIV-infected persons was inferior to published results from HIV-negative cohorts. Our results suggest that performance of transcriptomic signatures comprising interferon stimulated genes are negatively affected in HIV-infected individuals, especially in those with incompletely suppressed viral loads. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

abstract={Background Current guidelines recommend the use of the lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay (LAM) in HIV-positive, ambulatory patients with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) only if they are seriously ill or have CD4 count 100 cells/μl. We assessed the diagnostic yield of including LAM in TB diagnostic algorithms in HIV-positive, ambulatory patients with CD4 < 200 cells/μl, as well as the risk of mortality in LAM-positive patients who were not diagnosed using other diagnostic tools and not treated for TB. Methods and findings We conducted a prospective observational study including HIV-positive adult patients with signs and symptoms of TB and CD4 < 200 cells/μl attending 6 health facilities in Malawi and Mozambique. Patients were included consecutively from 18 September 2015 to 27 October 2016 in Malawi and from 3 December 2014 to 22 August 2016 in Mozambique. All patients had a clinical exam and LAM, chest X-ray, sputum microscopy, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) requested. Culture in sputum was done for a subset of patients. The diagnostic yield was defined as the proportion of patients with a positive assay result among those with laboratory-confirmed TB. For the 456 patients included in the study, the median age was 36 years (IQR 31–43) and the median CD4 count was 50 cells/μl (IQR 21–108). Forty-five percent (205/456) of the patients had laboratory-confirmed TB. The diagnostic yields of LAM, microscopy, and Xpert were 82.4% (169/205), 33.7% (69/205), and 40.0% (84/205), respectively. In total, 50.2% (103/205) of the patients with laboratory-confirmed TB were diagnosed only through LAM. Overall, the use of LAM in diagnostic algorithms increased the yield of algorithms with microscopy and with Xpert by 38.0% (78/205) and 34.6% (71/205), respectively, and, specifically among patients with CD4 100–199 cells/μl, by 27.5% (14/51) and 29.4% (15/51), respectively. LAM-positive patients not diagnosed through other tools and not treated for TB had a significantly higher risk of mortality than LAM-positive patients who received treatment (adjusted risk ratio 2.57, 95% CI 1.27–5.19, p = 0.009). Although the TB diagnostic conditions in the study sites were similar to those in other resource-limited settings, the added value of LAM may depend on the availability of microscopy or Xpert results. Conclusions LAM has diagnostic value for identifying TB in HIV-positive patients with signs and symptoms of TB and advanced immunodeficiency, including those with a CD4 count of 100–199 cells/μl. In this study, the use of LAM enabled the diagnosis of TB in half of the patients with confirmed TB disease; without LAM, these patients would have been missed. The rapid identification and treatment of TB enabled by LAM may decrease overall mortality risk for these patients. © 2019 Huerga et al.

abstract={Background: Tuberculosis (TB) among Diabetes Mellitus (DM) population is more expected to fail treatment of TB due to smear-negative TB. Objective: We sought to compare and evaluate different methods to study the frequency of TB infections among DM patients. Methods: Blood, sputum and urine samples were collected from 500 newly identified diabetic patients from different diabetic clinics in Warangal districts. Smear microscopy, Culture and Line Probe Assay by Polymerase Chain Reaction (LPA PCR) were used for identification of tuberculosis. Results: Based on the chest X-Ray of 200 diabetic patients, suspected with pulmonary infections, 113 were males, 85 were females and 2 were children. All 200 patients were tested for tuberculosis infections, 55 were confirmed based on chest X-ray lesions. Off 55 patients, 30 were positive and 25 were negative for AFB microscopy, but were shown positive for chest X-ray. 22 were reported to be culture positive on solid media and identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis based on morphology and biochemical methods. 36 samples were identified to be positive for LED, FM microscopy and LPA. Off 36 positive samples, 2 were MDR-TB and 34 were MTB based on LPA PCR method. Off 25 smear negative samples, 2 were identified as culture positive and confirmed to be MTB by morphological, biochemical tests. Conclusion: Smear Negative Microscopy plays a vital role in the spread of tuberculosis infection among diabetic patients. Along with the smear microscopy, there is a need to rely on other methods for rapid identification and diagnosis of tuberculosis among the diabetic patients to control the spread of infection in the community and household contacts. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={The first presentation of the combination of non-compaction cardiomyopathy with a restrictive-dilated phenotype and massive chronic tuberculous pericarditis, which for a long time was under the guise of hydropericardium in congestive heart failure in a patient of 30 years, is performed. The absence of congestion signs in a large circle of blood circulation became the reason for diagnosis of agnogenic pericarditis and pericardial puncture. A large volume (>1 l) and lymphocytic nature of effusion, its bilateral character, post-tuberculous changes and calcifications in the lungs, and intrathoracic lymphadenopathy testified in favor of the tuberculous etiology of the process. The negative result of all laboratory tests for tuberculosis (Diaskintest, exudate PCR test, fluorescence microscopy, inoculation on liquid media, Ziehl-Neelsen stain) and the high risk of thoracoscopic biopsy did not allow to immediately verify the diagnosis. It was made only after repeated elimination of 3,5 l of hemorrhagic exudate and the detection of mycobacterial DNA by PCR. As a result of quadruple tuberculostatic therapy, a remission of the process was achieved (there is no fluid in the pericardial cavity). © 2019, Silicea-Poligraf. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Prior Influenza A viral (IAV) infection has been shown to increase susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) and TB has also been shown to be a primary cause of death during pandemics, including the Spanish Influenza outbreak of 1918-1919. The majority of data has been obtained from mouse models, thus the aim of this study was to determine the impact of Flu co-infection on host immunity and disease severity in TB patients at diagnosis. Methods: Sputum from 282 patients with active TB were analyzed for presence of FluA/FluB RNA at presentation using multiplex PCR. Sputum RNA was also analyzed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) load using 16S RNA amplification. Supernatants from digested sputum and Mtb antigen-stimulated whole blood were analyzed using multiplex cytokine arrays and PBMC were analyzed for cytokine production from CD4+ T, CD8+ T and Mucosal Associated Invariant T cells (MAITs). Results: 12 (4.3%) of TB patients were found to have FluA or FluB viral RNA present in their sputum at the time of TB diagnosis. The TB/Flu co-infected patients had a significantly higher bacterial load compared to those with TB mono-infection (p = 0.0026). They had lower levels of IL17A in ex vivo sputum (p = 0.0275) and higher MCP-1 (CCL2) levels in the blood following PPD stimulation (p = 0.0267). TB/Flu co-infected subjects had significantly higher IFN-γ+IL-17+CD4+ and IFN-γ+IL-17-CD8+ cells compared to TB mono-infected subjects. Conclusions: These data show that Flu co-infection at time of TB diagnosis is associated with a higher bacterial load and differential cellular and soluble profiles. These findings show for the first time the impact of TB/Flu co-infection in a human cohort and support the potential benefit of Flu vaccination in TB-endemic settings. © 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

abstract={Introduction. Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major threat to human health. Due to the limited accuracy of the current TB diagnostic tests, it is critical to determine novel biomarkers for this disease. Circulating exosomes have been used as diagnostic biomarkers in various diseases. Objective of the Study. In this pilot study, we examined the expression of miRNAs as biomarker candidates for the diagnosis of TB infection. Methods. Serum-derived exosomes were isolated from TB patients and matched control subjects. The expression of miR-484, miR-425, and miR-96 was examined by RT-PCR methods. Results. The expression of miR-484, miR-425, and miR-96 were significantly increased in serum of TB patients which correlated with the TB infection level. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed the diagnostic potency of each individual serum exosomal miRNA with an area under the curve AUC=0.72 for miR-484 (p<0.05), 0.66 for miR-425 (p<0.05), and 0.62 for miR-96 (p<0.05). Conclusion. These results demonstrate that exosomal miRNAs have diagnostic potential in active tuberculosis. The diagnostic power may be improved when combined with conventional diagnostic markers. © 2019 Shamila D. Alipoor et al.},

abstract={Background: Infectious meningitis and encephalitis are potentially life-threatening conditions caused mostly by bacterial and viral agents. A rapid diagnosis and prompt treatment are associated with a favourable outcome. In recent years nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed to speed detection and identification of pathogens directly from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of a commercially available multiplex PCR assay for etiological diagnosis of infectious meningitis directly from CSF samples to that obtained after CSF cultures. A secondary endpoint was to look for a possible screening threshold based on main CSF indices and urgent blood tests results, to define CSF samples with low pre-test probability of PCR and/or culture positive result. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of results of CSF samples already processed as part of routine clinical care in the period February 2016 through December 2018. Results: 109 CSF samples were included in the study and a total of 14 bacteria were identified by either PCR, culture or both methods, along with nine samples positive for viruses. After exclusion of the isolates not detectable by the multiplex PCR panel, the diagnostic accuracy was: 100% (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.1% to 100%) sensitivity; 98.9% (95% CI: 93.5% to 99.9%) specificity; 85.7% (95% CI: 42% to 99.2%) positive predictive value; 100% (95% CI: 95.1% to 100%) negative predictive value; 96 (95% CI: 13.6 to 674.6) positive likelihood ratio; Zero negative likelihood ratio; Cohen’s kappa: 0.918, p<0.0001. CSF proteins value ≤ 28 mg/dl and CSF glucose/blood glucose ratio ≥ 0.78 were associated with both PCR negative result for bacteria or viruses and culture negative result. Conclusions: Even if on a limited sample of patients, the multiplex PCR evaluated in this study showed a very good diagnostic performance compared to culture and the thresholds found can be a useful tool to better choose which samples should be tested. © 2019, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche.

abstract={The performance of T-SPOT.TB (T-SPOT) assay in diagnosing pleural tuberculosis (plTB) is inconsistent. In this study, we compared the performance of peripheral blood (PB) and pleural fluid (PF) T-SPOT assay in diagnosing plTB. Between July 2017 and March 2018, 218 and 210 suspected plTB patients were prospectively enrolled from Wuhan (training) and Guangzhou (validation) cohort, respectively. PB T-SPOT, PF T-SPOT, and other conventional tests were simultaneously performed. Our data showed the performance of PB T-SPOT in diagnosing plTB was limited, especially with low sensitivity. However, the results of early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) in PF T-SPOT were significantly increased compared with those in PB T-SPOT in plTB patients. If using 76 as the cutoff value of MAX (the larger of ESAT-6 and CFP-10) in Wuhan cohort, the sensitivity and specificity of PF T-SPOT to diagnose plTB were 89.76 and 96.70%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of PF T-SPOT was better than other routine tests such as pathogen detection methods and biochemical markers. The diagnostic accuracy of PF T-SPOT in Guangzhou cohort was similar to that in Wuhan cohort, with a sensitivity and specificity of 91.07 and 94.90%, respectively. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells were more activated in PF compared with PB, and the frequency of mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T cells in PF was significantly higher than that in PB in plTB patients. In conclusion, the performance of PF T-SPOT is obviously better than PB T-SPOT or other laboratory tests, which suggests that PF T-SPOT assay has been of great value in the diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

abstract={Background & Objective: Epidemiology and predisposing factors of spondylodiscitis or vertebral osteomyelitis are different in various populations. This study was conducted to delineate the epidemiological and microbiological status of vertebral osteomyelitis in Hamadan, Iran. Materials & Methods: In this retrospective study, all patients with definite diagnosis of spondylodiscitis (changing of intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebral MRI signal) hospitalized in Besat and Farshchian Hospitals of Hamadan between 2006 and 2015 (during 10 years) were enrolled by convenience sampling. Data on age, gender, underlying disease, constitutional symptoms, place of acquiring infection, leukocytosis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), surgical intervention, vertebral biopsy culture, anemia, abscess, place of vertebral involvement, positive brucellosis test, and blood culture results were obtained from the patients’ medical files and recorded in a questionnaire. Results: A total of 71 patients with spondylodiscitis (mean age: 49.56 years) were enrolled. Brucella (n: 27, 38%) was the leading cause of the disease followed by tuberculosis (n: 11, 15.5%). Although 34 patients had positive serologic test for Brucella, other agents were causes of the disease according to course of treatment and vertebral biopsy in 7 of them. In 21 cases, the cause of the disease was unknown. The most common place of involvement was lumbosacral region (78.9%). Conclusion: Unlike Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline that do not recommend to perform age-guided aspiration biopsy in suspected cases of spondylodiscitis when Brucella is endemic and whereby people have strong positive serology, our results demonstrated that, even in case of positive Brucella test, other factors are likely to contribute to acquiring spondylodiscitis, and vertebral biopsy is recommended for definite diagnosis. Early diagnosis is necessary to select appropriate antibiotic and treat spondylodiscitis early. © 2019, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A 35-year-old man with a prior history of liver transplantation 18 months ago was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with fever and worsening dyspnea and was diagnosed with severe pneumonia leading to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). He had a prolonged hospitalization and was treated with empiric broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics, oseltamivir, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and subsequently caspofungin and ganciclovir. Blood, nasopharyngeal, as well as Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were negative for all viral, bacterial, and fungal causes of pulmonary infection except Enterovirus-Human Rhinovirus (EV-HRV) that was positive with high titers on BAL and swab specimens. Consequently, the diagnosis of EV-HRV pneumonia complicated by ARDS was established. The patient gradually improved and was discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks. This report highlights EV-HRV as a cause of ARDS in immunocompromised adults. © 2019 NRITLD, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Iran.},

abstract={Background: The Harpy eagle (Harpia harpyia) is the largest raptor in the Neotropical region, distributed in low densities within primary forest habitats from southern Mexico to east-central Brazil, including Central America and Panama. Although locally extinct due to habitat degradation, human poaching and reduction of tropical forests in recent decades, some remnant populations are known to be small and isolated. Thus, information on its ecology, including infectious diseases, is critical for conservation efforts and management of populations of this emblematic species in the wild. Avian Mycobacteriosis (AM) is a chronic disease affecting a wide range of birds and mammals and clinical cases have been sporadically reported, although in harpy eagles, has not been documented. In addition, scant information exists on pathologies affecting raptors, therefore, this report expands the knowledge on infectious diseases affecting wild birds. This study describes the first case of AM in an immature harpy eagle rescued from Darien gap and presents details of the clinical manifestation of the disease and its histological findings. Case: An immature harpy eagle was presented to a rescue center after being confiscated by Ministry of Environment from a local farm in a remote region of Eastern Panama, in the Darien gap. The raptor had a history of having been kept in captivity for approximately five weeks, cohabiting with backyard poultry and fed corn, raw duck and chicken provided by farm owners. Stagnant water was offered for drinking. The harpy eagle arrived to the facility very lethargic and emaciated. Physical examination revealed damaged plumage, poor body condition and dyspnea. Complete blood count revealed anemia and leukocytosis based on lymphocytosis and eosinophilia. Biochemical profile evidenced an increased level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), phosphorus and total plasma protein. Most remarkable radiographic findings were splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and increased opacity in kidneys, intestines, and aerial sacs. None of the other diagnostic tests performed were conclusive, like tracheal, esophageal and cloacal cultures for fungal infection and fecal exam. After one week of treatment, it showed a remarkable recovery, but at the end of the second week, declined dramatically, dying in the third week of treatment. Post-mortem examination revealed the presence of diffuse granulomas in multiple organs. Histologic examination with gram and Ziehl Neelsen staining revealed the presence of gram-positive and acid-fast bacteria, compatible with Mycobacterium-like bacilli. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the hsp65, digested with BstEII and HaEIII restriction enzymes confirmed the presence Mycobacterium avium complex in tissues samples. Discussion: This is the first report of AM in a harpy eagle, presenting an extreme emaciation with dyspnea, abnormalities in spleen, liver and air sacs. Biochemical and hematological parameters revealed alterations consistent with infection and organ malfunctions in liver, but Mycobacteriosis was not suspected initially and it was necessary to support the diagnosis with histopathological studies and DNA amplification for a proper identification of the disease. This allowed us to confirm that ante-mortem clinical diagnosis of Avian Mycobacteriosis can be challenging, especially in birds who usually show non-specific signs of the disease and external lesions are not commonly observed. Further studies are requiring to determine the characteristics and clinical signs of this disease in this and other raptors. Also, to determine the source of infection affecting raptors and other protected species in the Neotropical region, especially for diseases with relevance in the conservation of birds and animal health control. © 2019 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

abstract={Background: Highly active antiretroviral therapy has significantly changed the natural history of HIV infection, leading to a dramatic reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Late Presenters, Very Late Presenters and AIDS presenters still represent, also in Europe, including Italy, a huge challenge in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management. Case presentation: A 35-year-old male with a history of fever and back pain. HIV test resulted positive with a high HIV Viral Load and a very low T-CD4 number of cells (5 cells/mm 3 ). Imaging investigations revealed multiple vertebral and pulmonary lesions together with abdominal and thoracic lymphadenopathy. Blood cultures were positive for Cryptococcus neoformans and for Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Lymphnode biopsy resulted positive in PCR for Non-Tuberculosis Mycobacteria (Mycobacterium chelonae). A gastric biopsy also revealed a GIST. The patient also had CMV DNA positive. Although we performed antiretroviral therapy and specific-therapies for each disease, he was transferred to intensive care unit where he died due to an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Conclusion: The reported case is unusual due to the relevant number of opportunistic diseases (both infectious and tumoral) emerging not long after the HIV infection had been diagnosed. Late presenters HIV patients and AIDS presenters still represent a challenge, which is often too complex for clinicians to deal with. In spite of proper management, the risk of suboptimal results cannot be excluded. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background: Cutaneous tuberculosis represents only 1-2% of extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis. Scrofuloderma is an endogenous form of cutaneous tuberculosis and can present as isolated or coexist with pulmonary and disseminated forms of tuberculosis. Pathologically confirmed scrofuloderma coexisting with disseminated tuberculosis with a good treatment response is presented and discussed. Case presentation: A 12-year-old African Ethiopian girl presented with bilateral neck swelling with purulent discharge and skin ulceration of 3 months' duration. Dry cough, low-grade fever, decreased appetite, drenching night sweats, global throbbing headache, and a significant amount of weight loss were also reported. Biopsy of the skin identified scrofuloderma, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also identified by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and brain computed tomographic scans showed tuberculous meningitis and tuberculoma. Antituberculosis therapy with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol; prednisolone; pyridoxine; and wound care were provided. The patient was discharged for outpatient directly observed antituberculosis therapy in a nearby health center after acute complications were treated and once the skin lesion had started to dry or heal. Conclusions: Cutaneous tuberculosis should be considered in a child presenting with a skin lesion or discharge. Cutaneous tuberculosis cases should be investigated for coexisting pulmonary and extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis. Histopathologic diagnosis should be considered to rule out other skin pathologies and also to prevent delay in treatment. Better tuberculosis prevention strategies, including vaccination scale-up, are warranted. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={More sensitive tests are needed for the diagnosis of smear-negative and HIV-associated tuberculosis. This study compares the sensitivities and specificities of three molecular tests, namely, the Xpert MTB/RIF test, the Xpert Ultra (Ultra), and RealTime MTB (RT-MTB), in a high HIV prevalence setting. Symptomatic adults were recruited from three outpatient sites, and each provided 4 sputum specimens. The diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF, Ultra, and RT-MTB was evaluated, with culture as a reference standard. HIV infection occurred in 62% of patients, with a median CD4 count of 220 cells/l. The Ultra test had the highest sensitivity of 89.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.1 to 96) compared to those of the Xpert MTB/RIF at 82.1% (95% CI, 69.6 to 91.1; P 0.12) and RT-MTB at 78.6% (95% CI, 65.6 to 88.4; P 0.68). The specificity was highest with the Xpert MTB/RIF at 100% (95% CI, 98 to 100), followed by RealTime MTB at 96.7% (95% CI, 92.9 to 98.8; P 0.03) and the Ultra at 95.6% (95% CI, 91.5 to 98.1; P 0.08). In patients with smear-negative disease, the Ultra was more sensitive than the Xpert MTB/RIF (64.7% [95% CI, 38.3 to 85.8] versus 41.2% [95% CI, 18.4 to 67.1], respectively; P 0.12), and RT-MTB performed equally to Xpert MTB/RIF. In a comparison of the Ultra and RT-MTB on the same sputum specimen pellets, the Ultra was more sensitive than RT-MTB in the overall cohort (88.9% [95% CI, 77.4 to 95.8] versus 77.8% [95% CI, 64.4 to 88], respectively; P 0.03) and among people with HIV (87.5% [95% CI, 71 to 96.5] versus 68.6% [95% CI, 50 to 83.9], respectively; P 0.03). Although these results did not reach statistical significance, they suggest that the Ultra is more sensitive than the Xpert MTB/RIF and RT-MTB, most prominently in smear-negative disease. This was accompanied by a loss of specificity. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Objectives: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the severest form of tuberculosis, but current diagnostic tests are insensitive. Recent reports suggest simple modifications to conventional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) staining may greatly improve sensitivity. We sought to define the performance of modified and conventional ZN stain for TBM diagnosis. Methods: In hospitals in Vietnam, South Africa and Indonesia we conducted a prospective study of modified ZN with or without cytospin, conventional ZN smear, GeneXpert, and culture on CSF in adults with suspected TBM. Results: A total of 618 individuals were enrolled across 3 sites. Compared with the TBM clinical diagnostic gold standard for research (definite probable or possible TBM), sensitivity of conventional ZN and modified ZN with cytospin were 33.9% and 34.5% respectively (p = 1.0 for the difference between tests), compared with culture 31.8% and Xpert 25.1%. Using culture as a reference, sensitivities of conventional ZN, modified ZN with cytospin, and Xpert were 66.4%, 67.5%, and 72.3%, respectively. Higher CSF volume and lactate, and lower CSF:blood glucose ratio were independently associated with microbiologically confirmed TBM. Conclusions: Modified ZN stain does not improve diagnosis of TBM. Currently available tests are insensitive, but testing large CSF volumes improves performance. New diagnostic tests for TBM are urgently required. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) is emerging as a more serious pathogen due to the increased multidrug-resistant TB and co-infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The development of an effective and sensitive detection method is urgently needed for bacterial load evaluation in vaccine development, early TB diagnosis, and TB treatment. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a newly developed sensitive PCR method for the absolute quantification of nucleic acid concentrations. Here, we used ddPCR to quantify the circulating virulent M. tb-specific CFP10 (10-kDa culture filtrate protein, Rv3874) and Rv1768 DNA copy numbers in the blood samples from Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-vaccinated and/or virulent M. tb H37Rv-challenged rhesus monkeys. We found that ddPCR was more sensitive compared to real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR), as the detection limits of CFP10 were 1.2 copies/μl for ddPCR, but 15.8 copies/μl for qPCR. We demonstrated that ddPCR could detect CFP10 and Rv1768 DNA after 3 weeks of infection and at least two weeks earlier than qPCR in M.tb H37Rv-challenged rhesus monkey models. DdPCR could also successfully quantify CFP10 and Rv1768 DNA copy numbers in clinical TB patients' blood samples (active pulmonary TB, extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), and infant TB). To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that ddPCR is an effective and sensitive method of measuring the circulating CFP10 and Rv1768 DNA for vaccine development, bacterial load evaluation in vivo, and early TB (including EPTB and infant TB) diagnosis as well. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Culture filtrate protein (CFP-10) is a low molecular weight protein and is an early secretory protein in Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture filtrate and plays key roles in tuberculosis pathogenesis and in the stimulation of immunity. Keeping in view the important role of CFP10, we investigated the CFP10 gene in Indian Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) (3/86Rv) and its expression in suitable prokaryotic host for its diagnostics potential by single intradermal test (SID). Real-time PCR was used to quantify mRNA interferon-γ expression levels. The study concluded that the expression of IFN-γ mRNA in blood was found up to 19.962, 20.795, 9.633, 34.511 and 1.688 times in rCFP10, bovine PPD (purified protein derivative), avian PPD, conA and PBS stimulated groups, respectively as compared to healthy control group. The mRNA expression level of bovine PPD and avian PPD stimulated group was found statistically significant (at P <0.05) and among conA and rCFP10 stimulated group, it was highly significant (at P <0.01) in comparison to ‘without antigen stimulated’ group. © 2018, National Institute of Science Communication.

abstract={This study identified urinary biomarkers for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis. The urine proteomic profiles of 45 pulmonary tuberculosis patients prior to anti-TB treatment and 45 healthy controls were analyzed and compared using two-dimensional electrophoresis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Nineteen differentially expressed proteins were identified preliminarily, and western blotting and qRT-PCR were performed to confirm these changes at the translational and transcriptional levels, respectively, using samples from 122 additional pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 73 additional healthy controls. Two proteins, mannose-binding lectin 2 and a 35-kDa fragment of inter-α-trypsin inhibitor H4, exhibited the highest differential expression. We constructed a protein-microRNA interaction network that primarily involved complement and inflammatory responses. Eleven microRNAs from microRNA-target protein interactions were screened and validated using qRT-PCR with some of the above samples, including 97 pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 48 healthy controls. Only miR-625-3p exhibited significant differential expression (p < 0.05). miR-625-3p was increased to a greater extent in samples of smear-positive than smear-negative patients. miR-625-3p was predicted to target mannose-binding lectin 2 protein. A binary logistic regression model based on miR-625-3p, mannose-binding lectin 2, and inter-α-trypsin inhibitor H4 was further established. This three-biomarker combination exhibited better performance for tuberculosis diagnosis than individual biomarkers or any two-biomarker combination and generated a diagnostic sensitivity of 85.87% and a specificity of 87.50%. These novel urine biomarkers may significantly improve tuberculosis diagnosis. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis is one of the most prevalent infections in humans. Although culture is the reference for diagnosis, its sensitivity is compromised, especially in paucibacillary samples. Because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifies mycobacterial DNA, it is more sensitive than culture for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However, its performance can be affected by intrinsic sample inhibitors and by the extraction/detection techniques used. METHODS: We evaluated the influence of preanalytical conditions on Mtb detection in samples of sputum (SPU), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and pleural fluid (PF) using combinations of extraction/detection methods. Respiratory samples were prepared to contain different concentrations of red blood cells and nucleated cells to which increasing amounts of Mtb colonies were inoculated and submitted to PCR. RESULTS: Up to 102 CFU/ml of Mtb were detected in the SPU in all methods, except for the Roche extraction/detection method, regardless of the preanalytical sample condition. In BAL samples, medium and high concentrations of cells and high concentrations of red blood cells contributed to a lower Mtb detection, regardless of the extraction method used. In PF, red blood cells were the variable that most interfered with Mtb detection, with better recovery (102 CFU/ml) observed with the Qiagen/Nanogen combination. CONCLUSION: The choice of Mtb extraction and detection method is of fundamental importance for PCR analytical sensitivity, especially when paucibacillary samples and/or samples containing potential PCR inhibitors are analyzed.},

abstract={Rationale: Concurrent or sequential coinfections of Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae have been reported in the past though infrequently. Distinguishing a true co-infection from cross reactivity is often challenging as the diagnosis is mostly dependent on serological testing. Patient concerns: A 77-year-old male presented with worsening dyspnea, cough with yellow sputum, diarrhea and fever of 2-days duration. Patient had history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis (on methotrexate and leflunomide), treated pulmonary tuberculosis and 30-pack-year smoking. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial changes with left lower lobe infiltrate. On day 5, his urine antigen for L pneumophila serogroup 1 was reported positive. The following day his serum M pneumoniae IgM antibody titers were reported elevated at 6647 U/mL. Patient was started on antibiotics and placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with possible Legionella and Mycoplasma co-infection. Outcomes: Sputum Mycoplasma polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum cold agglutinins were obtained on day 6 and later reported negative. He was treated with azithromycin for 10 days with clinical improvement. Lessons: Serological testing alone is an indirect measure with poor sensitivity and specificity and has its own limitations. Urine antigen detection confirms L pneumophila serogroup 1 infection in a patient with suggestive symptoms. However, diagnosis of M pneumonia should be based on combination of tests including serology and PCR to confirm true co-infection. © 2018 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

abstract={Sexually transmitted infection (STI) of the upper reproductive tract can result in inflammation and infertility. A biomarker of STI-induced upper tract inflammation would be significant as many women are asymptomatic and delayed treatment increases risk of sequelae. Blood mRNA from 111 women from three cohorts was profiled using microarray. Unsupervised analysis revealed a transcriptional profile that distinguished 9 cases of STI-induced endometritis from 18 with cervical STI or uninfected controls. Using a hybrid feature selection algorithm we identified 21 genes that yielded maximal classification accuracy within our training dataset. Predictive accuracy was evaluated using an independent testing dataset of 5 cases and 10 controls. Sensitivity was evaluated in a separate test set of 12 women with asymptomatic STI-induced endometritis in whom cervical burden was determined by PCR; and specificity in an additional test set of 15 uninfected women with pelvic pain due to unknown cause. Disease module preservation was assessed in 42 women with a clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). We also tested the ability of the biomarker to discriminate STI-induced endometritis from other diseases. The biomarker was 86.7% (13/15) accurate in correctly distinguishing cases from controls in the testing dataset. Sensitivity was 83.3% (5/6) in women with high cervical Chlamydia trachomatis burden and asymptomatic endometritis, but 0% (0/6) in women with low burden. Specificity in patients with non-STI-induced pelvic pain was 86.7% (13/15). Disease modules were preserved in all 8 biomarker predicted cases. The 21-gene biomarker was highly discriminatory for systemic infections, lupus, and appendicitis, but wrongly predicted tuberculosis as STI-induced endometritis in 52.4%. A 21-gene biomarker can identify asymptomatic women with STI-induced endometritis that places them at risk for chronic disease development and discriminate STI-induced endometritis from non-STI pelvic pain and other diseases. © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

abstract={Endogenous circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported in various diseases. However, their role in active TB remains unknown. The study was aimed to determine plasma circRNA expression profile to characterize potential biomarker and improve our understanding of active TB pathogenesis. CircRNA expression profiles were screened by circRNA microarrays in active TB plasma samples. Dysregulated circRNAs were then verified by qRT-PCR. CircRNA targets were predicted based on analysis of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction. GO and KEGG pathway analyses were used to predict the function of circRNA. ROC curve was calculated to evaluate diagnostic value for active TB. A total of 75 circRNAs were significantly dysregulated in active TB plasma. By further validation, hsa_circRNA_103571 exhibited significant decrease in active TB patients and showed potential interaction with active TB-related miRNAs such as miR-29a and miR-16. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that hsa_circRNA_103571 was primarily involved in ras signalling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, T- and B-cell receptor signalling pathway. ROC curve analysis suggested that hsa_circRNA_103571 had significant value for active TB diagnosis. Circulating circRNA dysregulation may play a role in active TB pathogenesis. Hsa_circRNA_103571 may be served as a potential biomarker for active TB diagnosis, and hsa_circRNA_103571-miRNA-mRNA interaction may provide some novel mechanism for active TB. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis is recognized as a common complication of peritoneal dialysis. Eosinophilic peritonitis is a rare type of non-infection PD-related peritonitis. Eosinophilic peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients was first reported in 1967. The cause of eosinophilic peritonitis is obscure, however it may be related to some etiologies: (1) hypersensitivity to PD materials, including catheter or dialysate; (2) bacteria, fungal or mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Clinical investigations include asymptomatic cloudy PD effluent, fever, abdominal pain and eosinophil count elevate in PD effluent. Eosinophilic peritonitis is usually mild and self-limited. With the development of PD, more eosinophilic peritonitis cases and researches were reported. Here, we report a patient on CAPD with eosinophilic peritonitis. A 71-year-old female patient developed end-stage renal disease for 4 years and underwent CAPD (2 000 mL of 1.5% dialysis solution with four exchanges daily) for 5 months. With a history of unclean food, she was hospitalized for complaints of diarrhea, fever and cloudy peritoneal effluent for 10 days. Dialysis effluent showed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 1 980 cell/mm3, with 60% polymorphonuclear cells. She was diagnosed as PD-related peritonitis, and therapy was initiated with intraperitoneal ceftazidime 1 g once a day and vancomycin 500 mg every other day. She was admitted to the hospital as the symptoms were not relieved. Her peripheral blood cell count showed a total WBC count of 6 940 cells/mm3, 36.8% eosinophil. Her PD effluent analysis showed turbidity, total WBC count of 1 480 cells/mm3, and 83% polymorphonuclear cells. Her dialysate bacteria culture, fungus culture, polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB-PCR), acid-fast stain were all negative. On admission day 4, the treatments were changed to levofloxacin 200 mg once a day and vancomycin 500 mg every other day. After two weeks of antibiotics treatment, patient's symptoms were not completely improved and her dialysis effluent remained cloudy. Her blood eosinophil count elevated to 36.8%，eosinophil proportion in PD effluent>90% and PD effluent pathological findings showed eosinophil>90%. Eosinophilic peritonitis was diagnosed and a decision was made to give loratadine daily dose of 10 mg orally. The possible reasons might be the patient's allergy to some components of PD solution or connection systems in the beginning of PD, and this bacterial peritonitis episode, as well as the application of vancomycin, might lead to the fact that eosinophilic peritonitis acutely developed. For there was no improvement in clinical symptoms, loratadine was stopped, and the patient was discharged 18 days later, and received follow-up closely. Two months later, eosinophil count in blood and PD fluid decreased to normal range with no symptom. This case reminds us that in any PD-related peritonitis patient with prolonged symptoms after appropriate antibiotic therapy, and typical clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of eosinophilic peritonitis should be considered. For the count and percentage of eosinophils are not routinely reported in most laboratories, doctors need to contact the department of laboratory and the department of pathology, to confirm the cell count and proportion of eosinophils in dialysis effluent, so as to make the definite diagnosis, which can not only avoid antibiotics overuse, but also avoid antibiotics-induced eosinophilic peritonitis (such as vancomycin).},

abstract={Purpose: Mendelian suceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is a rare primary immunodeficiency predisposing to severe disease caused by mycobacteria and other intracellular pathogens. Delay in diagnosis can have an impact on the patient’s prognosis. Methods: We evaluated the IFN-γ circuit by studying IFN-γ production after mycobacterial challenge as well as IL-12Rβ1 expression and STAT4 phosphorylation in response to IL-12p70 stimulation in whole blood of a 6-year-old Peruvian girl with disseminated recurrent mycobacterial infection diagnosed as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Genetic studies with Sanger sequencing were used to identify the causative mutation. Microbiological studies based on PCR reactions were used to diagnose the specific mycobacterial species. Results: We identified a homozygous mutation in the IL12RB1 gene (p. Arg211*) causing abolished expression of IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12 response. MSMD diagnosis led to a microbiological reevaluation of the patient, revealing a BCG vaccine-related infection instead of tuberculosis. Treatment was then adjusted, with good response. Conclusions: We report the first Peruvian patient with IL-12Rβ1 deficiency. Specific mycobacterial species diagnosis within Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex is still challenging in countries with limited access to PCR-based microbiological diagnostic techniques. Awareness of MSMD warning signs and accurate microbiological diagnosis of mycobacterial infections are of the utmost importance for optimal diagnosis and management of affected patients. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background and Objective: To clarify whether there are different expressions between lung cancer and benign pulmonary diseases, we studied seven microRNAs (miRNAs) in serum from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), benign pulmonary nodules and four pulmonary inflammation diseases. Methods: We detected the expression of miRNAs using quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR). Results: We found that five miRNA ratios—miR-15b-5p/miR-146b-3p, miR-20a-5p/miR-146b-3p, miR-19a-3p/miR-146b-3p, miR-92a-3p/miR-146b-3p, and miR-16-5p/miR-146b-3p—show higher expression in the NSCLC group than the benign pulmonary nodule group, and 13 ratios of miRNAs were significantly upregulated in the NSCLC group compared with the pulmonary inflammation diseases group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. For NSCLC and benign pulmonary nodules, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.70 and 0.90, respectively. For NSCLC and pulmonary inflammation diseases, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.81 and 0.71, respectively. Conclusion: The ratios of miRNAs can be used as potential non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis of early-stage NSCLC and benign pulmonary diseases. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={85-year-old female had been hospitalized for a diagnosis of herpes zoster in the Dermatology Department 10 days ago due to redness and vesicular lesions on the left eyelids and the left side of the forehead, and had been started IV acyclovir 500 mg tid. She was consulted with us because of development of diplopia, agitation, and disorientation one day later. She was unconscious, and had partly encrusted vesicular lesions on a hyperemic ground extending to frontotemporal area and involving the left eyelids on her left side of the forehead. She was transferred to our clinic with the prediagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus and varicella zoster virus (VZV) encephalitis, and the acyclovir dose was escalated to 750 mg tid. There were 150/mm3 leukocytes (90% lymphocytes) and abundant erythrocytes on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microscopy. Biochemical analysis of CSF revealed concentrations of protein of 2149 mg/dL, glucose of 37 mg/dL and simultaneous blood glucose of 72 mg/dL. Gram and Ehrlich-Ziehl-Neelsen stained smears showed no microorganism. Both CSF and blood cultures yielded no growth. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Brucella standard tube agglutination were negative. In cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), there were bilateral periventricular diffuse, on FLAIR sequences, hyperintense nodular white matter signal abnormalities, deepening of cortical sulci and fissures, a subdural collection (14 mm in thickness) in bilateral frontal areas, and hyperintense abnormalities (5 mm in thickness) suggesting acute-subacute haemorrhage on the right in T1-weighted images. In diffusion MRI, there was no restricted diffusion compatible with cytotoxic edema in brainstem, cerebellum and both cerebral hemispheres. The collection was attributed to cortical atrophy, and an antiede-ma treatment was recommended in neurosurgical consultation. Dexamethasone 4 mg qid was started, and administered for 6 days by cutting half the dosage every other day. The patient got better beginning from 7th day of the antiviral therapy. Her consciousness, cooperation and orientation improved, and her skin lesions decreased. VZV DNA was found positive by PCR in CSF. Her therapy was completed on 21st day, and she was discharged from the hospital with full recovery. © 2018, AVES İbrahim KARA. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objective: To find and explore new candidate genes associated with spinal tuberculosis susceptibility.Methods: A total of 193 patients with spinal tuberculosis,who were treated in Hangzhou Red Cross Hospital from June 2013 to December 2015,were selected as the case group.A further 207 healthy subjects who came for physical tests in the same hospital during the same period were selected as the control group.We used high-throughput sequencing to analyze DNA from six patients and used bioinformatics to determine candidate genes associated with tuberculosis. Results: showed that the gene polymorphism,Fat-1(rs1280098,c.8798A &gt; C,p.Q2933P),was associated with the occurrence of spinal tuberculosis.Subsequently,the Sanger sequencing method was used to verify this mutation loci in both the control group and case group.Expression of Fat-1 was subsequently detected using real-time fluorescent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR). In addition,the levels of interleukin(IL)-12 and interferon gamma(IFN-γ),as well as other biochemical indicators were detected. Results There were 129(66.8%) AA genotypes,33(17.1%) AC genotypes,and 31(16.1%) CC genotypes in the case group,while there were 157(75.8%) AA genotypes,35(16.9%) AC genotypes,and 15(7.3%) CC genotypes in the control group.There was a significant difference between the two groups in the distribution of Fat-1 genotype(χ2=7.885,P=0.019). Logistic regression analysis of different genetic models showed that,in the additive model,CC homozygous mutation genotypes were correlated with increased incidences of spinal tuberculosis,while AC heterozygous mutation genotypes were associated with normal incidences of spinal tuberculosis(P&gt;0.05). In the dominant model,AC+CC mutation genotypes were correlated with increased incidences of spinal tuberculosis(P&lt;0.05);in the recessive model,CC homozygous mutation genotypes were correlated with increased incidences of spinal tuberculosis(P&lt;0.05);and the minor allele C of the polymorphism locus was related to the incidence of spinal tuberculosis(P&lt;0.05). The expression of Fat-1 in peripheral blood was lower in the case group than in the control group,while the levels of serum IL-12 and IFN-γ were higher in the case group compared with the control group(P&lt;0.05). The levels of lipoprotein A,C-reactive protein,erythrocyte sedimentation rate,and eosinophil counts in the case group were higher than those in the control group,while albumin level in the case group was lower than that in the control group(P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The gene polymorphism,Fat-1,is associated with the occurrence of spinal tuberculosis.In addition,the mutation of the Fat-1 gene results in reduced levels of Fat-1 gene transcription,as well as increased levels of the inflammatory cytokines,IL-12 and IFN-γ,in serum.These test results provide a molecular mechanism for the early diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis.

abstract={Background: The inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli influences tuberculosis (TB) progression. In this study, we aimed to identify the Phe206Leu polymorphism and serum L-selectin level in TB patients, compared to healthy individuals. Methods: Ninety patients with a diagnosis of TB and 90 healthy controls were selected in this study. The serum L-selectin level was determined, using ELISA. L-selectin polymorphism was also evaluated using PCR. For data analysis, SPSS was used at a significance level of 0.05. Results: According to the findings, the mean±SD age of the participants was 57.5 ± 18.4 and 56.5 ± 17.5 years in the TB and healthy groups, respectively. The TB group showed a significantly higher serum L-selectin level (1721.1 ± 330.9) versus the healthy controls (1624 ± 279). The L-selectin Phe allele frequencies were higher than the Leu allele frequencies in the main population, whereas the patients and controls were not significantly different. Eight (0.04%) subjects had Leu/Leu genotypes, 84 (46.6%) carried Phe/Leu genotypes, and 88 (48.8%) had Phe/Phe genotypes. Our results showed that the groups were not significantly different regarding L-selectin genotypes. Conclusion: TB patients had a significantly higher serum L-selectin level, compared to the controls. Based on the findings, the incidence of TB and L-selectin polymorphism in the Phe206Leu gene had no significant association. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background: Although intravesical bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) therapy is accepted as an effective treatment for bladder cancer, serious complications may occur in rare cases. To date, only 4 cases have been reported in which the patient developed a combination of mycotic aortic aneurysm and BCG spondylitis. Accurate diagnosis of BCG spondylitis is important because it is an iatrogenic disease, and its treatment is different from usual tuberculous spondylitis. However, distinguishing BCG spondylitis from usual tuberculous spondylitis is very difficult and takes a long time. In this study, we were able to suspect BCG spondylitis at an early stage from the result of the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Case presentation: We encountered a case of BCG spondylitis with adjacent mycotic aortic aneurysm after intravesical BCG therapy in a 76-year-old man. We performed a 2-stage operation to obtain spine stabilization and replace the aneurysm with a synthetic graft. We started multidrug therapy with antituberculosis medication, excluding pyrazinamide, because the patient's history of BCG therapy, negative IGRA, and positive of tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (Tb-PCR) suggested that the pathogenic bacteria of the spondylitis was BCG. Eventually the bacterial strain was identified as BCG by PCR-based genomic deletion analysis. Conclusions: BCG infection should be considered in patients who have been treated with BCG therapy, even if the treatment was performed several months to several years previously. In the case of a patient with a history of BCG therapy, a positive Tb-PCR result and negative IGRA result probably suggest BCG infections, if the possibility of false-negative IGRA result can be excluded. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Background Both osteoarticular tuberculosis (OA-TB) and inflammatory arthritis can lead to osteoarticular structural damage. These conditions exhibit similar symptoms, physical signs, and imaging features. Rapidly and accurately diagnosing OA-TB in patients with inflammatory arthritis presents a challenge to clinicians. Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a rapid diagnostic tool for diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. This study was designed to investigate diagnostic efficiency of Xpert for OA-TB in patients with inflammatory arthritis in China. Methods A total of 83 consecutive patients with inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB were enrolled prospectively from June 2014 to May 2018. Demographic, clinical, and biological data were recorded. Xpert assay, smear microscopy examination (smear), BACTEC MGIT 960 (MGIT 960), pathological examination, and T-SPOT.TB test were performed for each patient who received operations. Diagnostic efficiency of Xpert was evaluated based on a composite reference standard (CRS). Results A total of 49 out of 83 patients with inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB received operations, and 49 specimens were obtained during operations. According to CRS, 36 out of 49 patients with inflammatory arthritis were diagnosed with OA-TB, and 13 were not affected by the condition. Sensitivity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 960, pathological examination, and T-SPOT.TB test reached 66.70% (24/36), 25.00% (9/36), 30.55% (11/36), 47.22% (17/36), and 80.55% (29/36), respectively. Specificity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 960, and pathological examination was all 100% (13/13). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB test was 53.84% (7/13). Sensitivity of Xpert was higher than that of smear, MGIT 960 and pathological examination, but the sensitivity of Xpert was lower than that of T-SPOT.TB. Sensitivity of Xpert was statistically different from that of smear and MGIT 960 (P<0.001, P = 0.002), but the sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (P = 0.096, P = 0.181). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB was less than that of Xpert, smear, MGIT 960, and pathological examination, and the difference between them was statistically significant (P = 0.015). Among the 27 OA-TB patients with smear negative results, Xpert had the highest sensitivity, but sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (P = 0.413, P = 0.783). 2 of 36 OA-TB patients exhibited RIF resistance. Xpert was concordant with MGIT 960-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) in detecting rifampin (RIF) resistance. Conclusions Xpert is an efficient tool with high sensitivity and specificity for OA-TB diagnosis in patients with inflammatory arthritis in high-TB prevalence countries. Compared with conventional methods, Xpert has two advantages: one is fast, and the other is able to provide RIF resistance information simultaneously. © 2018 Li et al.

abstract={Aim: Genital tuberculosis (GTB) is a potent contributor to irreversible damage to the reproductive system and infertility in females. As no gold standard diagnostic tool is yet available, clinical suspicion and relatively insensitive approaches such as histopathology, laparoscopy and hysterosalpingogram are currently critical determinants in the diagnosis of GTB. Although a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay using endometrial tissue seems promising, sampling does require an invasive procedure. Objective: We hypothesized that menstrual blood may provide an alternate non-invasive source of samples for PCR-based GTB diagnosis. Methods: We enrolled 195 women with primary infertility in whom GTB was suspected. We obtained ethics committee approval from our institution and written informed consent from subjects. Endometrial tissue and menstrual blood was collected from the subjects and culture, histopathology, and multiplex PCR with both sample type was performed for each subject. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of multiplex PCR was, respectively, 90.2 and 86.1% for menstrual blood, 95.8 and 84.3% for endometrial tissue, and 64.8 and 93.2% for histopathology staining. Conclusions: A strong clinical suspicion aided with multiplex PCR using menstrual blood may significantly reduce the diagnostic dilemma for GTB diagnosis in a non-invasive, sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective manner. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a devastating and terminal disease in non-human primates (NHPs). Regular TB screenings using the intradermal tuberculin test (TST) have been the mainstay of TB surveillance and control in NHPs. Historically, Aotus monkeys have been considered less susceptible to TB than other NHPs. Here we present the diagnosis and epidemiology of a TB outbreak at The Gorgas Memorial Institute Aotus colony in Panama, and the results of two cross-sectional randomized TB screening studies, using antibody (Ab) and IFN-gamma release assay testing. Results: Epidemiological and spatial analysis confirmed that the outbreak was the result of a continuing intermittent exposure, with human to monkey transmission as the most likely source. During the outbreak that lasted five months (January-June 2015), Mycobacterium kansassi and MTB were isolated from lung caseous granulomas in 1/7 and 3/7 TB suspicious animals respectively. Furthermore, MTB was detected by qRT-PCR in formalin fixed lung and liver granulomas in 2/7 and 1/6 monkeys respectively, suggesting an aerosol route of infection. Likewise, a random sample that included 63 / 313 adult (>2 year-old) monkeys, screened for latent TB with the Primagam® IFN-gamma release assay, between March-May, 2016, were all non-reactors; indicating that the outbreak was self-limiting and the colony was likely free or latent TB infection. Control measures included, quarantine, disinfection and TST screening of all personnel. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Aotus are highly susceptible to TB, therefore, TB prevention measures should be strictly enforced in Aotus monkey colonies. © 2018},

abstract={MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to, and suppressing the expression of genes. Research show that microRNAs have potential to be used as biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment response and can be used for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, microRNA expression has effects on immune cell functions, which may lead to disease. Considering the important protective role of neutrophils and B-cells during M.tb infection, we evaluated the expression of microRNAs, known to alter function of these cells, in the context of human TB. We utilised real-time PCR to evaluate the levels of microRNA transcripts in the peripheral blood of TB cases and healthy controls. We found that neutrophil-associated miR-197-3p, miR-99b-5p and miR-191-5p transcript levels were significantly lower in TB cases. Additionally, B-cell-associated miR-320a, miR-204-5p, miR331-3p and other transcript levels were higher in TB cases. The miRNAs differentially expressed in neutrophils are predominantly implicated in signalling pathways leading to cytokine productions. Here, the decreased expression in TB cases may imply a lack of suppression on signalling pathways, which may lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma. Furthermore, the miRNAs differentially expressed in B-cells are mostly involved in the induction/suppression of apoptosis. Further functional studies are however required to elucidate the significance and functional effects of changes in the expression of these microRNAs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background: Potentially untreatable Plasmodium falciparum malaria threatens the Greater Mekong subregion. A previous series of pilot projects in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam suggested that mass drug administration was safe, and when added to provision of early diagnosis and treatment, could reduce the reservoir of P falciparum and interrupts transmission. We examined the effects of a scaled-up programme of this strategy in four townships of eastern Myanmar on the incidence of P falciparum malaria. Methods: The programme was implemented in the four townships of Myawaddy, Kawkareik, Hlaingbwe, and Hpapun in Kayin state, Myanmar. Increased access to early diagnosis and treatment of malaria was provided to all villages through community-based malaria posts equipped with rapid diagnostic tests, and treatment with artemether–lumefantrine plus single low-dose primaquine. Villages were identified as malarial hotspots (operationally defined as >40% malaria, of which 20% was P falciparum) with surveys using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR either randomly or targeted at villages where the incidence of clinical cases of P falciparum malaria remained high (ie, >100 cases per 1000 individuals per year) despite a functioning malaria post. During each survey, a 2 mL sample of venous blood was obtained from randomly selected adults. Hotspots received targeted mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin–piperaquine plus single-dose primaquine once per month for 3 consecutive months in addition to the malaria posts. The main outcome was the change in village incidence of clinical P falciparum malaria, quantified using a multivariate, generalised, additive multilevel model. Malaria prevalence was measured in the hotspots 12 months after mass drug administration. Findings: Between May 1, 2014, and April 30, 2017, 1222 malarial posts were opened, providing early diagnosis and treatment to an estimated 365 000 individuals. Incidence of P falciparum malaria decreased by 60 to 98% in the four townships. 272 prevalence surveys were undertaken and 69 hotspot villages were identified. By April 2017, 50 hotspots were treated with mass drug administration. Hotspot villages had a three times higher incidence of P falciparum at malarial posts than neighbouring villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2·7, 95% CI 1·8–4·4). Early diagnosis and treatment was associated with a significant decrease in P falciparum incidence in hotspots (IRR 0·82, 95% CI 0·76–0·88 per quarter) and in other villages (0·75, 0·73–0·78 per quarter). Mass drug administration was associated with a five-times decrease in P falciparum incidence within hotspot villages (IRR 0·19, 95% CI 0·13–0·26). By April, 2017, 965 villages (79%) of 1222 corresponding to 104 village tracts were free from P falciparum malaria for at least 6 months. The prevalence of wild-type genotype for K13 molecular markers of artemisinin resistance was stable over the three years (39%; 249/631). Interpretation: Providing early diagnosis and effective treatment substantially decreased village-level incidence of artemisinin-resistant P falciparum malaria in hard-to-reach, politically sensitive regions of eastern Myanmar. Targeted mass drug administration significantly reduced malaria incidence in hotspots. If these activities could proceed in all contiguous endemic areas in addition to standard control programmes already implemented, there is a possibility of subnational elimination of P falciparum.

abstract={Background: Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in children is challenging. Hereby we report a case series of 4 patients where Cartridge Based Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (CB NAAT) helped us in early diagnosis. Case characteristics: Case 1 was a 14-year old girl who was on anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) for 2 months without any improvement; sputum CBNAAT detected multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Case 2 was a 9-year old boy with history and examination findings suggestive of meningitis; CB-NAAT of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive. Case 3 was a 1-year old child having fever, cough of 1 month duration with Mantoux positive. CB-NAAT of gastric lavage was positive. Case 4 was a 3- month old child who presented with severe respiratory distress of 11 days duration. Chest x-ray showed miliary mottling; CB-NAAT of gastric lavage was positive. Conclusion: CB-NAAT testing was very useful in making an early and definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis, including MDR-TB. © 2017},

abstract={BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) cases primarily relies on methods that detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli or their DNA in patient samples (e.g., mycobacterial culture and Xpert MTB/RIF assays), but these tests have low clinical sensitivity for patients with paucibacillary TB disease. Our goal was to evaluate the clinical performance of a newly developed assay that can rapidly diagnose active TB cases by direct detection of Mtb-derived antigens in patients’ blood samples. METHODS: Nanoparticle (NanoDisk)-enriched peptides derived from the Mtb virulence factors CFP-10 (10-kDa culture factor protein) and ESAT-6 (6-kDa early secretory antigenic target) were analyzed by high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS). Serum from 294 prospectively enrolled Chinese adults were analyzed with this NanoDisk-MS method to evaluate the performance of direct serum Mtbantigen measurement as a means for rapid diagnosis of active TB cases. RESULTS: NanoDisk-MS diagnosed 174 (88.3%) of the study’s TB cases, with 95.8% clinical specificity, and with 91.6% and 85.3% clinical sensitivity for culture-positive and culture-negative TB cases, respectively. NanoDisk-MS also exhibited 88% clinical sensitivity for pulmonary and 90% for extrapulmonary TB, exceeding the diagnostic performance of mycobacterial culture for these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Direct detection and quantification of serum Mtb antigens by NanoDisk-MS can rapidly and accurately diagnose active TB in adults, independent of disease site or culture status, and outperform Mycobacterium-based TB diagnostics. © 2017 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.},

abstract={Rationale: Contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) constitute an important target population for preventive measures because they are at high risk of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and progression to disease. Objectives: We investigated bio-signatures with predictive ability for incident TB. Methods: In a case-control study nested within the Grand Challenges 6-74 longitudinal HIV-negative African cohort of exposed household contacts, we employed RNA sequencing, PCR, and the pair ratio algorithm in a training/test set approach. Overall, 79 progressors who developed TB between 3 and 24 months after diagnosis of index case and 328 matched nonprogressors who remained healthy during 24 months of follow-up were investigated. Measurements and Main Results: A four-transcript signature derived from samples in a South African and Gambian training set predicted progression up to two years before onset of disease in blinded test set samples from South Africa, the Gambia, and Ethiopia with little population-associated variability, and it was also validated in an external cohort of South African adolescents with latent M. tuberculosis infection. By contrast, published diagnostic or prognostic TB signatures were predicted in samples from some but not all three countries, indicating site-specific variability. Post hoc meta-analysis identified a single gene pair, C1QC/TRAV27 (complement C1q C-chain / T-cell receptor-a variable gene 27) that would consistently predict TB progression in household contacts from multiple African sites but not in infected adolescents without known recent exposure events. Conclusions: Collectively, we developed a simple whole blood-based PCR test to predict TB in recently exposed household contacts from diverse African populations. This test has potential for implementation in national TB contact investigation programs. Copyright © 2018 by the American Thoracic Society.},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the serological diagnostic value of Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis four new antigens Rv0432, Rv0674, Rvl566c and Rvl547. Methods: Rv0432, Rv0674, Rvl566c and Rvl547 were amplified from M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv genomic DNA by using PCR, among which Rvl547 was divided into two segments for amplification (Rvl547-l and Rvl547-2). The segments were cloned into expression vector PET-32a while the recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography. Serums were incubated with BL21 (DE3) proteins. Antibodies IgG against M. tuberculosis were tested with 151 serum samples (41 healthy people and 110 TB patients) by using ELISA. The diagnostic efficiency of antigens was analyzed by means of receiver operating characteristic curve. Difference of the objective proteins in TB patients and healthy controls was compared by (-test. Results: Recombinant antigens Rv0432, Rv0674, Rvl566c, Rvl547-1 and Rv 1547-2 were successfully expressed and purified. Results: from ELISA showed that the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, Youden index and area under the curve of Rv0432, Rv0674, Rvl566c, Rvl547-1 and Rvl547-2, as 43.64%-92.73%, 80.49%-92.68%, 0.92-0.94, 0.38-0.80, 0.363-0.732 and 0.649-0.915. All the objective proteins showed significantly higher antibody levels in TB patients, when compared to the healthy controls (P< 0.000 1). Conclusion: The newly identified antigens Rv0432, Rv0674, Rvl566c, Rvl547-1 and Rvl547-2 all performed well when being used for TB serological diagnosis, thus were expected to be new candidate antigens used for TB diagnosis. © 2018 Chinese Medical Association.

abstract={Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a public health concern due to its association with fetal malformation and neurologic disease. Objective: To report a reference centre experience on ZIKA virus (ZIKV) infection in travelers from epidemic countries from January 1 to September, 30, 2016 in Italy North-West (a geographic area covering 4.424 million inhabitants, corresponding to almost 73% of Italy North-West area). Study design: One hundred and twelve febrile travelers were studied to rule out a tropical fever [e.g. malaria, dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), West Nile (WNV) and ZIKV]. Molecular tests for detecting ZIKV RNA were applied on serum or urine as well as IgG and IgM specific serology. Results: ZIKV was the most frequent “tropical infection (11.6%) with 12 infected travelers and one sexual partner of an infected traveler. At the time of the diagnosis, ZIKV RNA was detected in the blood from 9 patients (69%) within 7 days from symptom onset; afterwards, the virus was detected only in urine (5 patients) and ZIKV IgM was reactive in 9 patients (69%). Travelers with ZIKV infection tested negative for DENV, CHIKV, WNV and malaria and completely recovered. Other infections identified in travelers were DENV (5 patients, 4.5%), CHIKV (1, 0.9%), malaria (Plasmodium vivax, 1, 0.9%), measles (1, 0.9%) and tuberculosis (1, 0.9%). Conclusions: The etiologic diagnosis of a febrile illness in travelers where ZIKV is endemic is highly desirable as they are sentinel of a challenging epidemiology including the risk of autochthonous transmission in non endemic countries where the competent or carrier vector is present. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={A 33-year-old man with ulcerative colitis presented with 5-day history of fever, night sweats, abdominal pain and increased stool frequency. He was on mesalazine M/R 1g once daily, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) 75mg once daily and prednisolone 40mg once daily. Examination revealed fever and tachycardia. Blood examinations identified a persistent leucopenia, C reactive protein of 23 mg/L and an initial alanine transaminase of 855 IU/L. Flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed well-demarcated, punched-out ulcers in the proximal rectum and distal sigmoid, with histology pathognomonic of cytomegalovirus (CMV). CMV DNA PCR was 51140 copies/mL. Despite prompt withdrawal of 6-MP, steroids and initiation of intravenous ganciclovir on day 2 of admission, his systemic illness, diarrhoea and fever persisted until day 19 of antiviral therapy. Other copathogens and lymphoma were ruled out on serology and CT scan, respectively. After an unusually prolonged course of antiviral therapy, the patient made a full clinical recovery, bloods normalised and there were two consecutive undetectable CMV DNA PCRs. © 2018 BMJ Publishing Group.

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is primarily caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis, which belongs to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The airborne route is considered the most common for transmission of M. bovis, and more than 15% of cattle with bTB shed the Mycobacterium, which can be detect by nested PCR to amplify mycobacterial mpb70 from a nasal swab from a cow. To screen for cytokines fostering early and accurate detection of bTB, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from naturally M. bovis-infected, experimentally M. bovis 68002-infected, and uninfected cattle, then these cells were stimulated by PPD-B, CFP-10-ESAT-6 (CE), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 6 h. The levels of interferon gamma (IFN-γ), IFN-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), IL-6, IL-12, IL-17A, and tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA were measured using real-time PCR. To explore the cytokines associated with different periods of M. bovis infection, cattle were divided into three groups: PCR-positive, PCR-negative, and uninfected using the tuberculin skin test, CFP-10/ESAT-6/TB10.4 protein cocktail-based skin test, IFN-γ release assay (IGRA), CFP-10/ESAT-6 (CE)-based IGRA, and nested PCR. The expression of IP-10, IL-17A, and IFN-γ proteins induced by PPD-B, CE, or PBS was detected by ELISA. The results showed that levels of PPD-B-stimulated IL-17A and IP-10 (mRNA and protein), and CE-induced IP-10 (mRNA and protein) were significantly higher in cattle naturally or experimentally infected with M. bovis than in those that were uninfected. The levels of PPD-B- or CE-induced IL-17A and IP-10 (protein) could be used to differentiate M. bovis-infected calves from uninfected ones for 6 to 30 weeks post-infection, whereas PPD-B- and CE-induced IP-10 and IL-17A mRNA expression could be used to differentiate M. bovis-infected calves from uninfected ones between 6 and 58 weeks post-infection. However, CE-induced IL-17A (protein) was not a reliable indicator of M. bovis infection in cattle that were confirmed positive for infection by nested PCR. Furthermore, the levels of PPD-B- or CE-induced IP-10 and IL-17A protein were lower than IFN-γ in M. bovis-infected cattle. Therefore, IL-17A and IP-10 protein are not suitable biomarkers for bTB. Antigen-induced IP-10 mRNA should be analyzed further for their potential to be used in the diagnosis of bTB. © 2018 Xin, Gao, Yang, Li, Liang, Hou, Sui, Guo, Yuan, Zhu, Ding and Jia.},

abstract={Background: HIV Viral Load and Early Infant Diagnosis technologies in many high burden settings are restricted to centralized laboratory testing, leading to long result turnaround times and patient attrition. GeneXpert (Cepheid, CA, USA) is a polyvalent near point-of-care platform and is widely implemented for Xpert MTB/RIF diagnosis. This study sought to evaluate the operational feasibility of integrated HIV VL, EID and MTB/RIF testing in new GeneXpert platforms. Methods: Whole blood samples were collected from consenting patients due for routine HIV VL testing and DBS samples from infants due for EID testing, at three rural health facilities in Zimbabwe. Sputum samples were collected from all individuals suspected of TB. GeneXpert testing was reserved for all EID, all TB suspects and priority HIV VL at each site. Blood samples were further sent to centralized laboratories for confirmatory testing. GeneXpert polyvalent testing results and patient outcomes, including infrastructural and logistical requirements are reported. The study was conducted over a 10-month period. Results: The fully automated GeneXpert testing device, required minimal training and biosafety considerations. A total of 1,302 HIV VL, 277 EID and 1,581 MTB/RIF samples were tested on a four module GeneXpert platform in each study site. Xpert HIV-1 VL testing was prioritized for patients who presented with advanced HIV disease, pregnant women, adolescents and suspected ART failures patients. On average, the study sites had a GeneXpert utilization rate of 50.4% (Gutu Mission Hospital), 63.5% (Murambinda Mission Hospital) and 17.5% (Chimombe Rural Health Centre) per month. GeneXpert polyvalent testing error rates remained lower than 4% in all sites. Decentralized EID and VL testing on Xpert had shorter overall median TAT (1 day [IQR: 0-4] and 1 day [IQR: 0-1] respectively) compared to centralized testing (17 days [IQR: 13-21] and 26 days [IQR: 23-32] respectively). Among patients with VL >1000 copies/ml (73/640; 11.4%) at GMH health facility, median time to enhanced adherence counselling was 8 days and majority of those with documented outcomes had re-suppressed VL (20/32; 62.5%). Median time to ART initiation among Xpert EID positive infants at GMH was 1 day [IQR: 0-1]. © 2018 Ndlovu et al.

abstract={Background: Early diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is crucial to achieve optimum outcomes. There is no effective rapid diagnostic test for use in children. We aimed to develop a clinical decision tool to facilitate the early diagnosis of childhood TBM. Methods: Retrospective case-control study was performed across 7 hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (2010-2014). We identified the variables most predictive of microbiologically confirmed TBM in children (3 months to 15 years) by univariate analysis. These variables were modelled into a clinical decision tool and performance tested on an independent sample group. Results: Of 865 children with suspected TBM, 3% (25) were identified with microbiologically confirmed TBM. Clinical information was retrieved for 22 microbiologically confirmed cases of TBM and compared with 66 controls matched for age, ethnicity, sex and geographical origin. The 9 most predictive variables among the confirmed cases were used to develop a clinical decision tool (CHILD TB LP): Altered Consciousness; caregiver HIV infected; Illness length &gt;7 days; Lethargy; focal neurologic Deficit; failure to Thrive; Blood/serum sodium &lt;132 mmol/L; CSF &gt;10 Lymphocytes ×106/L; CSF Protein &gt;0.65 g/L. This tool successfully classified an independent sample of 7 cases and 21 controls with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90%. Conclusions: The CHILD TB LP decision tool accurately classified microbiologically confirmed TBM. We propose that CHILD TB LP is prospectively evaluated as a novel rapid diagnostic tool for use in the initial evaluation of children with suspected neurologic infection presenting to hospitals in similar settings. © 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

abstract={Aims The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical value of the plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) concentrations and strand integrity as an auxiliary tool for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) differential diagnosis from tuberculosis in patients with solitary pulmonary nodules detected by computed tomography (CT). Methods This research was divided into 3 groups: NSCLC (n = 106), tuberculosis (n = 105) and healthy controls (n = 107). The quantization of plasma DNA fragments was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Amplifying and quantifying shorter (115 bp) and longer (247 bp) fragments from abundant genomic ALU repeats. Results The level of cfDNA (ALU115) in patients with NSCLC [95.67 (51.28, 238.85) ng/μl] was significantly higher than that in patients with tuberculosis [59.60 (34.25, 102.53) ng/μl, P = 0.001] and that in healthy controls [44.66 (24.56, 66.54) ng/μl, P = 0.001]. The integrity of cfDNA in patients with NSCLC [5.91(4.14, 7.45)] was also significantly higher than that in patients with tuberculosis [3.85 (2.91, 5.06), P = 0.000] and that in healthy controls [2.78(2.18, 4.82), P = 0.000]. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that cfDNA(ALU115) and its integrity could be used as biomarkers to distinguish NSCLC from tuberculosis (AUC = 0.628, P = 0.001, cut-off values = 91.48, sensitivity = 57.50%, specificity = 64.80%; AUC = 0.722, P = 0.000, cut-off values = 5.54, sensitivity = 55.70%, specificity = 82.90%, respectively). In addition, the effect of integrity of cfDNA(AUC = 0.722) to distinguish NSCLC from tuberculosis was higher than traditional tumor marker Carbohydrate antigen 125(CA125) (AUC = 0.626), Neuron-specific enolase(NSE) (AUC = 0.716) and Carcino-embryonic antigen(CEA) (AUC = 0.589). Conclusions cfDNA and its integrity could be used as indicators for identification of NSCLC from tuberculosis. Moreover, the effect of integrity of cfDNA to distinguish NSCLC from tuberculosis was higher than traditional tumor marker CA125, NSE and CEA. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Background/Aims: Dysregulated expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) was demonstrated to be implicated in many diseases. Here, we aimed to determine circRNA profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from active tuberculosis (TB) patients to identify novel biomarkers for TB. Methods: Expression profile of circRNAs in PBMCs from 3 active pulmonary TB patients and 3 healthy controls were analyzed by microarray assay. Six circRNAs were selected for validation using real time-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in 40 TB patients and 40 control subjects. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate their values in TB diagnosis. Hsa-circRNA-001937 was chosen for further evaluation in an independent cohort consisting of 115 TB, 40 pneumonia, 40 COPD, 40 lung cancer patients and 90 control subjects. An eight-month follow up was performed in 20 newly diagnosed TB patients to investigate the expression change of hsa-circRNA-001937 after chemotherapy. Results: We revealed and confirmed that a number of circRNAs were dysregulated in TB patients. Of the six studied physio circRNAs, the levels of hsa-circRNA-001937, hsa-circRNA-009024 and hsa- circRNA-005086 were significantly elevated and hsa-circRNA-102101, hsa-circRNA-104964 and hsa-circRNA-104296 were significantly reduced in PBMCs from TB patients as compared to healthy controls. ROC curve analysis suggested that hsa-circRNA-001937 has the largest area under the curve (AUC = 0.873, P<0.001). Hsa-circRNA-001937 was significantly increased in patients with TB compared with patients with pneumonia, COPD and lung cancer. Hsa- circRNA-001937 was correlated with TB severity (r = 0.4053, P = 0.010) and its expression significantly decreased after treatment. Conclusion: This study identified a set of deregulated circRNAs in active TB PBMCs, our data also suggest that hsa-circRNA-001937 can be used as a potential diagnostic biomarker of TB. © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={Background &amp; objectives: Bartonella henselae causes infections which closely resemble febrile illness and chronic diseases such as tuberculosis and haematological malignancies. There are not many studies on Bartonella infections from India. The present study was undertaken to diagnose B. henselae infection in diverse clinical conditions in a tertiary care hospital in north India. Methods: A total of 145 patients including those with fever and lymphadenopathy, infective endocarditis and neuroretinitis were enrolled in the study. Whole blood, serum and lymph node aspirate and valvular vegetations if available, were obtained. Samples were plated on chocolate agar and brain-heart infusion agar containing five per cent fresh rabbit blood and were incubated at 35°C for at least four weeks in five per cent CO2 with high humidity. Immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) was done for the detection of IgM antibodies in the serum using a commercial kit. Whole blood was used to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the citrate synthase gene (gltA). Results: IFA was positive in 11 of 140 (7.85%) patients and PCR was positive in 3 of 140 (2.14%) patients. Culture was negative in all the cases. A higher incidence of Bartonella infection was seen in patients with fever and lymphadenopathy (n=30), seven of whom were children. In ophthalmological conditions, four cases were IFA positive. Interpretation &amp; conclusions: The present study shows that the threat of Bartonella infection is a reality in India. It is also an important treatable cause of fever and lymphadenopathy in children. Serology and PCR are useful tests for its diagnosis. Clinicians should consider Bartonella infection in the differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses and chronic diseases. © 2018 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research},

abstract={This study reports on the diagnostic potential of IFN-γ release assays and serology for Mycobacterium bovis in six naturally M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) exposed bulls of which four were intratracheally infected with a Belgian field strain of M. bovis. Heparinized blood, serum and fecal samples were collected at regular time intervals for mycobacteria-specific IFN-γ release assays, antibody analysis and for Map culture respectively. Single intradermal skin test (SIT) with bovine tuberculin (PPD-B) was performed on day 115 and animals were sacrificed on day 133 after M. bovis infection. Organs were collected and stored for histopathological examination, modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining and bacteriological analysis of M. bovis and Map by culture and RT-PCR. Prior to infection five animals showed positive IFN-γ responses to avian PPD (PPD-A) and four were positive in Map PCR (IS900) on faeces. Three M. bovis infected animals reacted as early as day 14 with sustained higher PPD-B than PPD-A specific IFN-γ responses, whereas the fourth animal (with the strongest PPD-A response prior to infection) showed sustained higher PPD-B specific IFN-γ levels only a day 56 after infection. Two of the infected animals had a sustained positive IFN-γ response to the ESAT-6/CFP-10/TB7.7 (QuantiFERON®-TB Gold) peptide cocktail as early as day 14, among which the animal with the initial high PPD-A response. Later during infection, positive responses were found to ESAT-6 peptides in three infected bulls and to CFP-10 peptides in all four infected bulls. One of the control animals reacted intermittently to the ESAT-6/CFP10/TB7.7 cocktail. Prior to SIT, weak but positive MPB83/MBP70 specific antibody responses were detected in two of the infected bulls. All four M. bovis infected bulls reacted with a positive skin test and showed, as reported by others, increased mycobacteria specific IFN-γ production and increased positive responses in MPB83/MBP70 specific serology after SIT. At autopsy, M. bovis lesions were detected in all four experimentally infected bulls. Our results indicate that in Map exposed cattle, M. bovis diagnosis using IFN-γ assays needs a combination of PPD-B/A and ESAT-6/CFP10 for early and optimal sensitivity and that sensitivity of MPB83/MBP70 serodiagnosis is dramatically increased by prior skin testing. Map exposure did not interfere with the development of SIT in M. bovis infected animals, but resulted in a false positive M. bovis specific IFN-γ and antibody response after SIT in one of the two control animals (which remained negative in skin-test). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The purpose of the present study was to investigate the diagnostic value of T cells spot test (T-Spot TB) combined with interferon-γ (INF-γ) and interleukin-27 (IL-27) in tuberculous pleurisy. Sixty patients with tuberculous pleurisy (observation group) and 60 patients with non-tuberculous pleurisy (control group) were enrolled in this study. T-Spot TB was performed to detect the pleural effusion of two groups of patients. Levels of IFN-γ and IL-27 in serum and pleural effusion were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Relative expression of IFN-γ mRNA and IL-27 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected by RT-PCR. Positive rate of T-Spot TB in observation group was 96.7% (58 cases), which was significantly higher than that in control group (p<0.05). Concentration of INF-γ in pleural effusion of observation group was 468.6±24.8 ng/l, which was significantly higher than that in control group (131.3±18.7 ng/l, p<0.05). Concentration of IL-27 in pleural effusion of observation group was 423.4±37.2 ng/l, which was significantly higher than that in control group (116.2±15.5 ng/l, p<0.05). Concentrations of INF-γ and IL-27 in serum of observation group were 48.2±13.4 and 41.7±10.6 ng/l, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in control group (38.6±11.2 and 35.3±8.4 ng/l, p<0.05). Relative expression levels of INF-γ mRNA and IL-27 mRNA in observation group were significantly higher than those in control group (p<0.05). Therefore, combination of T-Spot TB with INF-γ and IL-27 has significant application value in the clinical diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy, and should be popularized. © 2018, Spandidos Publications.

Ionogram objectified slight hepatic cytolysis and chest X-ray showed bilateral miliaria. BK research using sputum was negative as well as Genexpert TB test. Anatomopathological examination of the osteomedullar biopsy revealed epitheliogigantocellular granuloma without caseous necrosis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed mycobacterium tuberculosis in osteomedullary biopsy. Liver biopsy showed epithelioid granuloma without caseous necrosis. The diagnosis of multifocal tuberculosis with pulmonary, hematopoietic and hepatic impairment was retained. Miliary Tuberculosis is a severe form of tuberculosis. Bacilloscopies are often negative and the diagnosis can be retained based on other sampling, including cerebrospinal fluid sampling and osteomedullary biopsy. Different kinds of biopsies enable diagnosis in rare cases. PCR, a technique used in molecular biology, has enabled to shorten the window period from disease onset to diagnosis as well as treatment implementation. Miliary tuberculosis can be life-threatening; therefore, sometimes, treatment must be administered before certain diagnosis. © Nabil Tiresse et al.},

abstract={One of the differential diagnoses of cervical lymphadenitis is tuberculous lymphadenitis, which can be difficult to confirm. Herein, we report a case of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis, in which the diagnosis was made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and direct smear examination for acid-fast bacilli. A 95-year-old female patient was referred to us with a cervical mass. She had undergone surgical incision and drainage for a left cervical abscess four months previously. One month later, she was referred for plastic surgery to treat a fistula that had developed at the site of incision. Three months thereafter, she was referred to us from the plastic surgery department for a right cervical mass with redness of the overlying skin. Ultrasonography revealed a mass with an irregular margin, poor blood flow, and heterogeneous contents on the right side of her neck. Cervical lymphadenitis was suspected and an antibiotic was prescribed. However, the size of the mass increased and an abscess evolved. The T-SPOT.TB blood test was positive, indicating the diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis. We aspirated pus from the mass, and examination of direct smears of the pus and PCR revealed the causative organism as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Based on this experience, we recommend the use of PCR, direct smear examination, and interferon-γ release assays, such as T-SPOT.TB, for confirming the diagnosis of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis. © 2018 Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

abstract={Central nervous system (CNS) disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is highly devastating. Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most common form of CNS tuberculosis (TB). Rapid, sensitive, and affordable diagnostic tests are not available. Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) stain has a very low sensitivity in cases of TBM, the sensitivity rates is of about 10–20%.The detection rate can be improved by taking large volume CSF samples (>6 ml) and prolonged slide examination (30 min). Culture of MTB from the CSF is slow and insufficiently sensitive. The sensitivity is different, which varies from 36% to 81.8%. The microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS) assay was recommended by the World Health Organization in 2011. The sensitivity is 65%, which is more sensitive and faster than CSF smear. Commercial PCR assays were found to be insensitive at detecting MTB in CSF samples. Many research provided the value of ADA on the TBM diagnosis. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are not recommended for diagnosis of active TB disease. Imaging is essential in diagnosis and showing complications of CNS TB. Thwaites criteria and the Lancet consensus scoring system (LCSS) were developed to improve the diagnosis of TBM. Clinicians will continue to make judgment based on clinical examination, inflammatory CSF examinations, imaging studies, and scoring systems. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={Melioidosis, a syndrome with protean clinical manifestations, is caused by Gram-negative soil saprophyte Burkholderiapseudomallei. Among its diverse clinical presentations, the involvement of spine is a rare phenomenon and can mimic tuberculosis on presentation. A 65-year-old female with a known case of diabetes presented with fever with lower back pain. Blood culture grew Staphylococcus aureus, and as per sensitivity report, clindamycin and cefazolin were started. X-ray and MRI lumbosacral spine showed spondylodiscitis (likely Koch's). Decompression and biopsy were done, and a sample was sent for microbiological investigations that showed no growth of any significant pathogen; furthermore, all tests for tuberculosis diagnosis also remained negative. Active Melioidosis Detect Lateral Flow Assay was used on the tissue sample, which was positive for B. pseudomallei Capsular Polysaccharide (CPS) antigen; the case was confirmed by typethree secretion system 1 PCR for melioidosis. Antibiotics were changed to parenteral ceftazidime for 2 weeks followed by oral cotrimoxazole.

abstract={Tuberculoma is one of the manifestations of tuberculosis infection in the central nervous system. Even though its prevalence is only 1%, the mortality rate is high. Clinical presentation in immunocompromised patients with tuberculoma maybe different, thus making the diagnosis difficult. We present the case of a 13-year-old girl who was admitted for routine intravenous administration of cyclophospha-mide and steroid therapy for nephritis due to systemic lupus erythematosus. She experienced severe headache and focal seizure on the second day of hospitalization. Neurology examination did not show any abnormalities. The Xpert MTB/RIF from the cerebrospinal fluid and sputum yielded negative results. Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed tuberculoma with caseous necrosisaround the fibrous capsule in the right occipital lobe of the brain. Electroencephalography showed no abnormalities. Clinical improvement was seen after 3weeks of treatment; however, antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity occurred. © 2018 by Turkish Thoracic Society.},

abstract={Background: The prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis infections had increased among the type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patients in India, although the biological basis underlying this susceptibility remains poorly characterized. Based on the symptom’s, chest X-rays and their correlation with clinical and diagnostic parameters, we had suspected diabetic-tuberculosis co-infections. As Chest X-Ray plays a vital role in the identification of pulmonary tuberculosis infections, we emphasized more on it. Chest X-ray features included were; (infiltrate, cavitation, miliary shadows, pleural effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and extent of lesions) such features were analyzed to identify associations with biological/clinical parameters through univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Method: The study was carried out in diabetic type 2 patients suspected with pulmonary tuberculosis infections, Warangal, India. Spoligotyping was used for identification, detection and characterization of M. tuberculosis complex bacteria in clinical samples. This method is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a highly polymorphic direct repeat locus in the M. tuberculosis genome. It is helpful in detecting causative bacteria and in providing epidemiologic information on genotyping strain identities. Results: Based on the chest X-Ray of 200 diabetic patients suspected with pulmonary infections, we found 26 infiltrates, 30 cavitation, 28 miliary shadows, 35 pleural effusion, 46 mediastinal lymphadenopathy and 35 were confirmed for the extent of lesions, which supported us to further screen for pulmonary tuberculosis of 200 subjects tested, 113 were males, 85 were females and 2 were children. All 200 subjects were tested for pulmonary tuberculosis, 36 were positive by smear microscopy and 20 were culture positive. Phenotypic and genotypic variations were found for all the 20 identified clinical isolates, by conventional and molecular methods of 20 clinical isolates, 4 MDR-TB were identified based on the Drug Susceptibility Test for first-line drugs. Of 20 clinical isolates, we took 10 clinical isolates (4-were MDR-TB and 6-were MTB) and 1-was control sample of H37RV used for spoligotyping and showed different patterns Bejing (1) and Lineages of East Asian, of family EA13(2) and Lineages of Indo-Oceanic, of family LAM1(1) and Lineages of Euro-American and 6 were found to be MTB of family 33(2) and Lineages of Indo-Oceanic, of family CAS(4) and Lineages of Un-known family. CAS (Central Asian) of M.tuberculosis strains showed more prevailing spoligotype pattern in Diabetic Pulmonary Tuberculosis patients. Conclusion: Implementing such a method in clinical settings would be useful in surveillance of tuberculosis transmission and in interventions to prevent further spread of this disease among the Diabetic Pulmonary Tuberculosis co-infections. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Pseudotumour is a benign inflammatory lesion. Mycobacterial spindle cell pseudotumour (MSP) is a rare pseudotumour. It is a benign proliferation of spindle-shaped histiocytes containing acidfast mycobacterium, commonly reported in immunocompromised patients. MSP is usually associated with mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Here, we present the case of a 38-year-old gentleman with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who presented with low-grade fever for 1-month duration. Clinically, he had generalised lymphadenopathy. Chest X-ray showed miliary infiltration in bilateral lung fields. Lymph nodal biopsy showed spindle-shaped histiocytes filled with acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, suggestive of MSP. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains were positive for CD68, S-100 and negative for CD31, which are consistent with MSP. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the biopsy tissue was positive for MTB. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was continued and antitubercular therapy (ATT) was started. The fever resolved within two weeks and there was a resolution of lymph nodal swelling by 6 weeks. The diagnosis of MSP associated with mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) makes our case interesting. It is of utmost importance to differentiate MSP from Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and other pseudotumours and to know whether it is of tubercular or non-tubercular origin, as the treatment is entirely different. © 2018, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

abstract={Introduction: In an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance among both bacterial and fungal pathogens, the ability to identify infectious microorganisms directly in clinical specimens to guide effective antimicrobial therapy early in the course of disease has become paramount. Molecular diagnostic tests that can detect pathogens in multiple specimen types including blood, sputum, stool, urine or cerebrospinal fluid, can decrease the time to diagnosis often to less than 1 hour and improve both antimicrobial use and associated infection prevention measures. Although molecular tests typically demonstrate high degrees of sensitivity and specificity, their cost and the lack of outcome studies showing their positive impact on patient management can be impediments to uptake in laboratories. Areas covered: Diagnostic tests used to identify a broad range of infectious agents causing respiratory tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, sepsis, as well as tests for biomarkers indicative of infection are reviewed. Data are based on a search of the literature using PubMed. Expert commentary: Rapid molecular diagnostic methods are the standard of care for many sexually transmitted diseases and are used increasingly to identify agents of sepsis. Host response markers to identify the presence of infection and differentiate between bacterial and viral agents will be the next major wave of diagnostic tools. Barriers to implementation of molecular diagnostic tests include siloed hospital budgets and the reluctance of many physicians to switch to rapid technologies that, while often superior to traditional microbiological methods in sensitivity and specificity, have little published outcome data to support their use. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Background: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening recessive genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the gene encoding the fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR). The CF clinical phenotype shows wide variation ranging from severe disease in early childhood in those homozygous for the p.Phe508del mutation to absence of the vas deferens in otherwise healthy men homozygous for the p.Arg117His mutation. Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from whole blood from 62 patients with CF. The CFTR mutation was determined by Allele-Specific PCR assay. The spearman and linear regression analysis were used to obtain the correlation between phenotype and genotype relationship. Results: Out of total 62 patients, 35 (56.4%) were male. The mean age of the patients was 15.56 ± 6.65 years. Mutations in CFTR were detected in 64.5% of the patients. The commonest mutations were p.Phe508del (33.9%), p.Arg117His; [5T] (5.64%), p.Arg117His; [7T] (4.03%) and p.Trp1282X (5.64%). Mutations p.Ile507del (4%), p.Gly542X (4%), p.Asn1303Lys (2.42%), c.489+1G>T (1.6%), p.Gly551Asp (1.6%) and c.1585-1G>A (1.6%) were also detected. Most mutations were detected in west and south of Iran, while p.Phe508del mutation was dominant mutation (75%) in east and southeast of Iran. The study showed either an association between this mutation with severity of disease and sex or an association between p.Arg117His mutations and age at diagnosis. Conclusion: The geographic distribution of gene mutation in Iranian cystic fibrosis patients was very heterogenic. In spite of the study that showed a correlation between p.Phe508del and severity of disease, to find any correlation between genotype and phenotype a broad and multi-centered study is recommended. © 2018 NRITLD, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Iran.},

abstract={HIV-associated disseminated TB (tuberculosis) has been under-recognised and poorly characterised. Blood culture is the gold-standard diagnostic test, but is expensive, slow, and may under-diagnose TB dissemination. In a cohort of hospitalised HIV patients, we aimed to report the prevalence of TB-blood-culture positivity, performance of rapid diagnostics as diagnostic surrogates, and better characterise the clinical phenotype of disseminated TB. HIV-inpatients were systematically investigated using sputum, urine and blood testing. Overall, 132/410 (32.2%) patients had confirmed TB; 41/132 (31.1%) had a positive TB blood culture, of these 9/41 (22.0%) died within 90-days. In contrast to sputum diagnostics, urine Xpert and urine-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) combined identified 88% of TB blood-culture-positive patients, including 9/9 who died within 90-days. For confirmed-TB patients, half the variation in major clinical variables was captured on two principle components (PCs). Urine Xpert, urine LAM and TB-blood-culture positive patients clustered similarly on these axes, distinctly from patients with localised disease. Total number of positive tests from urine Xpert, urine LAM and MTB-blood-culture correlated with PCs (p < 0.001 for both). PC1&PC2 independently predicted 90-day mortality (ORs 2.6, 95%CI = 1.3-6.4; and 2.4, 95%CI = 1.3-4.5, respectively). Rather than being a non-specific diagnosis, disseminated TB is a distinct, life-threatening condition, which can be diagnosed using rapid urine-based tests, and warrants specific interventional trials. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Simple effective tools to monitor the long treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are lacking. Easily measured host derived biomarkers have been identified but need to be validated in larger studies and different population groups. Here we investigate the early response in IP-10 levels (between day 0 and day 7 of TB therapy) to identify bacteriological status at diagnosis among 127 HIV-infected patients starting TB treatment. All participants were then classified as responding or not responding to treatment blindly using a previously described IP-10 kinetic algorithm. There were 77 bacteriologically confirmed cases and 41 Xpert MTB/RIF® and culture negative cases. Most participants had a measurable decline in IP-10 during the first 7 days of therapy. Bacteriologically confirmed cases were more likely to have high IP-10 levels at D0 and had a steeper decline than clinically diagnosed cases (mean decline difference 2231 pg/dl, 95% CI: 897-3566, p = 0.0013). Bacteriologically confirmed cases were more likely to have a measurable decline in IP-10 at day 7 than clinically diagnosed cases (48/77 (62.3%) vs 13/41 (31.7%), p < 0.001). This study confirms the association between a decrease in IP-10 levels during the first week of treatment and a bacteriological confirmation at diagnosis in a large cohort of HIV positive patients. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Objective We validated the accuracy of host selected signature gene set using unstimulated whole blood (WB), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). Methods The unstimulated WB and PBMC from 1417 individuals with active pulmonary TB patients, other lung diseases and healthy participants were analyzed using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results The WB cohort test demonstrates that the combination of GBP5 and KLF2 can differentiate active TB versus HC with sensitivity and specificity of 77.8% and 87.1%, respectively; but most importantly active TB versus OD with sensitivity and specificity of 96.1% and 85.2%, respectively. Again during treatment course, the TB score of GBP5 and KLF2, analytes secretion and clinical parameters were found to be associated in disease progression. In the PBMC cohort test, we found that the only and best discriminatory combination was GBP5, DUSP3 and KLF2 inthe active TB versus HC with a sensitivity and specificity of 76.4% and 85.9%, respectively. Conclusions Our study reveals that GBP5 and KLF2 may be useful as a diagnostic tool for active TB, also the two-gene set may serve as surrogate biomarkers for monitoring TB therapy. © 2017},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major worldwide health problem and has caused millions of deaths in the past few years. Current diagnostic methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and sputum culture, are time-consuming and cannot prevent the rapid spreading of TB during the diagnostic period. In this connection, detecting biomarkers specific to TB at molecular level in plasma of patients will provide a rapid means for diagnosis. In this study, we first evaluated the differential expression of the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the plasma from patients with TB (TB positive), community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthy individuals (CG) using lncRNA microarray scanning. It was found that there were 2116 specific lncRNAs differentially expressed in the TB positive samples (1102 up-regulated and 1014 down-regulated), which accounted for 6.96% of total lncRNAs. Twelve differentially expressed lncRNAs discovered in microarray were subsequently validated by using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Two lncRNAs (ENST00000354432 and ENST00000427151) were further validated with more Tuberculosis samples. These results suggested the expression level of lncRNAs and the two validated lncRNAs in plasma could be the potential molecular biomarkers for the rapid diagnosis of Tuberculosis. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) remained as one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide despite an overall decline in its incidence rate globally. Extrapulmonary TB is uncommon and only accounts for 10-20% of overall TB disease burden. Abdominopelvic TB is the sixth most common location of extrapulmonary TB. The symptoms and signs are often insidious and nonspecific. Diagnosing abdominopelvic TB can be very challenging at times and poses great difficulties to the clinician. Infection with nontuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) is even rarer especially in an immunocompetent patient. We report a case of NTM in abdominopelvic TB. A 37-year-old foreign worker, para 3, presented with a one-week history of suprapubic pain associated with fever. An assessment showed presence of a right adnexal mass. She was treated as tuboovarian abscess with intravenous antibiotics. Unfortunately, she did not respond. She underwent exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperatively, features of the mass were suggestive of a right mature cystic teratoma with presence of slough and cheesy materials all over the abdominal cavity as well as presence of ascites. Diagnosis of NTM was confirmed with PCR testing using the peritoneal fluid. This case was a diagnostic dilemma due to the nonspecific clinical presentation. Management of such rare infection was revisited. © 2017 Beng Kwang Ng et al.},

abstract={Cavities are important in clinical diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in the regulation of inflammation, the relation between plasma miRNA and pulmonary tuberculosis with cavity remains unknown. In this study, plasma samples were derived from 89 cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis (CP-TB) patients, 89 non-cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis (NCP-TB) patients and 95 healthy controls. Groups were matched for age and gender. In the screening phase, Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology was employed to analyze miRNA profiles in plasma samples pooled from CP-TB patients, NCP-TB patients and healthy controls. During the training and verification phases, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to verify the differential expression of selected miRNAs among groups. Illumina high-throughput sequencing identified 29 differentially expressed plasma miRNAs in TB patients when compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis validated miR-769-5p, miR-320a and miR-22-3p as miRNAs that were differently present between TB patients and healthy controls. ROC curve analysis revealed that the potential of these 3 miRNAs to distinguish TB patients from healthy controls was high, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) ranged from 0.692 to 0.970. Moreover, miR-320a levels were decreased in drug-resistant TB patients than pan-susceptible TB patients (AUC = 0.882). In conclusion, we identified miR-769-5p, miR-320a and miR-22-3p as potential blood-based biomarkers for TB. In addition, miR-320a may represent a biomarker for drug-resistant TB. © 2017 Cui et al.

abstract={Purpose Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death among people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Several factors influence the efficacy of TB treatment by leading to suboptimal drug concentrations and subsequently affecting treatment outcome. The aim of this cohort is to determine the association between anti-TB drug concentrations and TB treatment outcomes. Participants Patients diagnosed with new pulmonary TB at the integrated TB-HIV outpatient clinic in Kampala, Uganda, were enrolled into the study and started on first-line anti-TB treatment. Findings to date Between April 2013 and April 2015, the cohort enrolled 268 patients coinfected with TB/HIV; 57.8% are male with a median age of 34 years (IQR 29-40). The median time between the diagnosis of HIV and the diagnosis of TB is 2 months (IQR 0-22.5). The majority of the patients are antiretroviral therapy naive (75.4%). Our population is severely immunosuppressed with a median CD4 cell count at enrolment of 163 cells/μL (IQR 46-298). Ninety-nine per cent of the patients had a diagnosis of pulmonary TB confirmed by sputum microscopy, Xpert/RIF or culture and 203 (75.7%) have completed TB treatment with 5099 aliquots of blood collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Future plans This cohort provides a large database of well-characterised patients coinfected with TB/HIV which will facilitate the description of the association between serum drug concentrations and TB treatment outcomes as well as provide a research platform for future substudies including evaluation of virological outcomes.

abstract={Sustained elimination of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) requires the reduction and control of parasite reservoirs to minimize the transmission of Leishmania donovani infection. A simple, reproducible and definitive diagnostic procedure is therefore indispensable for the early and accurate detection of parasites in VL, Relapsed VL (RVL) and Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients, all of whom are potential reservoirs of Leishmania parasites. To overcome the limitations of current diagnostic approaches, a novel quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method based on Taqman chemistry was devised for the detection and quantification of L. donovani in blood and skin. The diagnostic efficacy was evaluated using archived peripheral blood buffy coat DNA from 40 VL, 40 PKDL, 10 RVL, 20 cured VL, and 40 cured PKDL along with 10 tuberculosis (TB) cases and 80 healthy endemic controls. Results were compared to those obtained using a Leishmania-specific nested PCR (Ln-PCR). The real time PCR assay was 100% (95% CI, 91.19-100%) sensitive in detecting parasite genomes in VL and RVL samples and 85.0% (95% CI, 70.16-94.29%) sensitive for PKDL samples. In contrast, the sensitivity of Ln-PCR was 77.5% (95% CI, 61.55-89.16%) for VL samples, 100% (95%CI, 69.15-100%) for RVL samples, and 52.5% (95% CI, 36.13-68.49%) for PKDL samples. There was significant discordance between the two methods with the overall sensitivity of the qPCR assay being considerably higher than Ln-PCR. None of the assay detected L. donovani DNA in buffy coats from cured VL cases, and reduced infectious burdens were demonstrated in cured PKDL cases who remained positive in 7.5% (3/40) and 2.5% (1/40) cases by real-time PCR and Ln-PCR, respectively. Both assays were 100% (95% CI, 95.98-100) specific with no positive signals in either endemic healthy control or TB samples. The real time PCR assay we developed offers a molecular tool for accurate detection of circulating L. donovani parasites in VL, PKDL and RVL patients, as well as being capable of assessing response to treatment. As such, this real time PCR assay represents an important contribution in efforts to eliminate VL. © 2017 Hossain et al.

abstract={Focal brain lesion is a neurological complication in HIV, which is marked as a space occupying lesion (SOL) and needs rapid and effective treatment. This lesion is mainly caused by encephalitis toxoplasma and primary central nervous system lymphoma related to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which is difficult to distinguish using CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The gold standard of diagnosing focal brain lesion has been brain biopsy, but this examination is an invasive procedure that causes complications. The objective of this study is to obtain the rapid laboratory diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) and EBV infection. In this experimental study, blood and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained from HIV patients who were admitted to the Neurology Department of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. The samples were examined using duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect T. gondii and EBV. The first step was the optimization of duplex real-time PCR, including the annealing temperature, primer and probe concentration, elution volume, and template volume. Minimal DNA detection was used to measure minimal T. gondii and EBV. Cross reactions were determined for technical specificity using the bacteria and viruses Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, Candida spp, cytomegalovirus, herpes zoster virus, and varicella zoster virus. Duplex real-time PCR was applied optimally to patients. In the optimization of duplex real-time PCR, the annealing temperature of T. gondii and EBV were 58 °C, the concentration of primer forward and reverse for T. gondii and EBV were 0.2 μM, the concentration of probe for T. gondii and EBV were 0.4μM and 0.2 μM, respectively. Minimal DNA detection of T. gondii and EBV were 5.68 copy/ml and 1.31 copy/ml, respectively. There was no cross reaction between another bacteria and virus that were used as the primer and probe for T. gondii and EBV. The blood duplex real-time PCR was positive for T. gondii (16%), EBV (40%), and both (16%). The cerebrospinal fluid samples were positive for T. gondii (20%), EBV (28%), and both (4%). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease that has been threatening public health for many centuries. The clinical diagnostic procedure for TB is time-consuming and laborious. In the last 20 years, real-time fluorescence-based quantitative PCR (real-time PCR) has become a better alternative for TB diagnosis in clinics due to its sensitivity and specificity. Recently, digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) has been developed, and it might be an ideal alternative to conventional real-time PCR for microorganism detection. In this study, we aimed to assess the capacity of ddPCR and real-time PCR for detecting low levels of circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA. The study involved testing whole blood samples for an MTB DNA target (known as IS6110). Blood samples were obtained from 28 patients with pulmonary TB, 28 patients with extrapulmonary TB, and 28 healthy individuals. The results show that ddPCR could be used to measure low levels of MTB DNA, and it has the potential to be used to diagnose pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB based on clinical samples. © 2017 Yang, Han, Liu, Bai, Xu, Bao, Feng, Tao, Ma and Peng.},

abstract={Background: Lymphoma complicated with hemophagocytic syndrome and tuberculosis has been rarely reported. The clinical and radiological presentation of these potentially fatal conditions can be easily confused and there is a potential for misdiagnosis. Case Report: We present a 58-year-old Hispanic female who was admitted to the hospital with dizziness and fever. Her initial admission diagnosis was severe sepsis secondary to community acquired pneumonia. She was started on intravenous antibiotics. Due to mediastinal lymphadenopathy, lymphoma was considered as a differential diagnosis for which she underwent bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound-guided sampling of her mediastinal lymph nodes. Lymph node aspirate was suggestive of lymphoma. Initial cultures were negative. Her clinical course was complicated with respiratory failure, cytopenia, and rapidly progressive cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent cervical lymph node excision and bone marrow biopsy. The pathology of the lymph nodes confirmed T cell lymphoma, and bone marrow revealed hemophagocytosis. The patient was started on chemotherapy but she continued to deteriorate and died on day 20 of her hospital admission. Post-mortem results of cultures from a cervical lymph node biopsy and PCR were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Conclusions: We suggest an aggressive tissue diagnosis with staining for acid-fast bacilli for early diagnosis in patients presenting with hemophagocytic syndrome secondary to lymphoma as coexisting tuberculosis is a consideration. Tuberculosis re-activation should be considered in patients from an endemic region who present with lymphoma and a deteriorating clinical condition. © Am J Case Rep, 2017.},

abstract={Background: Introduction of GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay has constituted a major breakthrough for tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics. Several patient factors may influence diagnostic performance of Xpert including sputum quality. Objective: We carried out a prospective, observational, cross-sectional study to determine the effect of sputum quality on diagnostic performance of Xpert among presumed TB patients in Uganda. Methods: We collected clinical and demographic information and two sputum samples from participants. Staff recorded sputum quality and performed LED fluorescence microscopy and mycobacterial culture on each sample. If both smear examinations were negative, Xpert testing was performed. We calculated diagnostic yield, sensitivity, specificity, and other indicators for Xpert for each stratum of sputum quality in reference to a standard of mycobacterial culture. Results: Patients with salivary sputum showed a trend towards a substantially higher proportion of samples that were Xpert-positive (54/286, 19%, 95% CI 15–24) compared with those with all other sputum sample types (221/1496, 15%, 95% CI 13–17). Blood-stained sputum produced the lowest sensitivity (28%; 95% CI 12–49) and salivary sputum the highest (66%; 95% CI 53–77). Specificity didn’t vary meaningfully by sample types. Salivary sputum was significantly more sensitive than mucoid sputum (+13%, 95% CI +1 to +26), while bloodstained sputum was significantly less sensitive (-24%, 95% CI -42 to -5). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the need to exercise caution in collecting sputum for Xpert and in interpreting results because sputum quality may impact test yield and sensitivity. In particular, it may be wise to pursue additional testing should blood-stained sputum test negative while salivary sputum should be readily accepted for Xpert testing given its higher sensitivity and potentially higher yield than other sample types. These findings challenge conventional recommendations against collecting salivary sputum for TB diagnosis and could inform new standards for sputum quality. © 2017 Meyer et al.

abstract={Introduction: Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of Central Nervous System Tuberculosis (CNS-TB) and constitutes about 6% of all Extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) cases. Most guidelines for the diagnosis and management of TBM agree on the use of simple Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis using molecular tools like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). However, the sensitivity of PCR varies while using a CSF sample. In the present study, we have compared the diagnostic utility of PCR assay in both peripheral blood and CSF sample collected from TBM cases. Aim: To evaluate the application of the peripheral blood PCR assay as an alternate tool for TBM diagnosis compared to conventional CSF-PCR based system Materials and Methods: A total of 50 TBM patients were pros-pectively recruited from in patient department wards of Central India Institute of Medical Sciences (CIIMS) between January 2014 - Feburary 2015. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) specific IS6110 PCR and BactT liquid culture were performed in 20 of recruited cases classified as Stage 1, 2 and 3 based on British Medical Research Council (BMRC) contemporary clinical criteria for the severity of TBM. Clinical characteristics were summarised in terms of percentages for categorical variables, i.e., age groups, gender, signs and symptoms. All statistical analysis was carried out using MedCalc software version 11.6. Results: Overall IS6110 PCR positivity in CSF was around 80% (16/20), which was higher than culture (29.3%) and peripheral blood (39%). Out of 8 positive cases, stage wise positivity of peripheral blood PCR assay in three TBM stages was 0% (stage1) 50% (stage 2) and 67% (Stage 3) respectively. Positivity of peripheral blood PCR was significantly more (86%) in patients with CSF culture/ IS6110 PCR positive for MTB infection with sensitivity and specificity of 50 and 100% respectively. Increased positivity rates of peripheral blood PCR was observed with decreased CSF/Blood sugar ratio in stage 3 cases, suggesting enhanced probability of mycobacterial blood dissemination in cases of TBM severity. Conclusion: Our results suggest that although the molecular diagnosis of TBM infection in CSF remains the method of choice, peripheral blood based PCR can be used as a good alternative to CSF in case of TBM severity where the repeated CSF collection may be needed. However, study demands further validation in large cohorts to justify the present hypothesis. © 2017, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research. All rights reserved.},

abstract={To evaluate the value of miR-29a expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculous meningitis (TBM). Our study enrolled 112 children with TBM and 130 healthy children, from which PBMC and CSF were collected. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of miR-29a in PBMC and CSF, and then analyze the diagnostic value. Compared with control group, the miR-29a expressions in PBMC and CSF were increased in TBM children (both P < 0.05), and the expressions were associated with following factors: intracranial hypertension, conscious disturbance, focal cerebral symptoms, meningeal irritation, hydrocrania, abnormal electroencephalogram and extra-cerebral tuberculous (all P < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of miR-29a in PBMC was 67.20%, 88.50% and 0.852, respectively, and that in CSF was 81.10%, 90.00% and 0.890, respectively, and that in combination of PBMC and CSF was 84.40%, 95.38% and 0.934, respectively. miR-29a expression in PBMC and CSF may provide a reference for the diagnosis of pediatric TBM. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: We previously reported that one-third of HIV-positive adults requiring medical admission to a South African district hospital had laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis (TB) and that almost two-thirds of cases could be rapidly diagnosed using Xpert MTB/RIF-testing of concentrated urine samples obtained on the first day of admission. Implementation of urine-based, routine, point-of-care TB screening is an attractive intervention that might be facilitated by use of a simple, low-cost diagnostic tool, such as the Determine TB-LAM lateral-flow rapid test for HIV-associated TB. Methods: Sputum, urine and blood samples were systematically obtained from unselected HIV-positive adults within 24 hours of admission to a South African township hospital. Additional clinical samples were obtained during hospitalization as clinically indicated. TB was defined by the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in any sample using Xpert MTB/RIF or liquid culture. The diagnostic yield, accuracy and prognostic value of urine-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing were determined, but urine-LAM results did not inform treatment decisions. Results: Consecutive HIV-positive adult acute medical admissions not already receiving TB treatment (n = 427) were enrolled regardless of clinical presentation or symptoms. TB was diagnosed in 139 patients (TB prevalence 32.6%; median CD4 count 80 cells/μL). In the first 24 hours of admission, sputum (spot and/or induced) samples were obtained from 37.0% of patients and urine samples from 99.5% of patients (P < 0.001). The diagnostic yields from these specimens were 19.4% (n = 27/139) for sputum-microscopy, 26.6% (n = 37/139) for sputum-Xpert, 38.1% (n = 53/139) for urine-LAM and 52.5% (n = 73/139) for sputum-Xpert/urine-LAM combined (P < 0.01). Corresponding yields among patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/μL were 18.9%, 24.3%, 55.4% and 63.5%, respectively (P < 0.01). The diagnostic yield of urine-LAM was unrelated to respiratory symptoms, and LAM assay specificity (using a grade-2 cut-off) was 98.9% (274/277; 95% confidence interval [CI] 96.9-99.8). Among TB cases, positive urine-LAM status was strongly associated with mortality at 90 days (adjusted hazard ratio 4.20; 95% CI 1.50-11.75). Conclusions: Routine testing for TB in newly admitted HIV-positive adults using Determine TB-LAM to test urine provides major incremental diagnostic yield with very high specificity when used in combination with sputum testing and has important utility among those without respiratory TB symptoms and/or unable to produce sputum. The assay also rapidly identifies individuals with a poor prognosis. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Tuberculosis is one of the main etiologies to evoke in the context of lymphocyte pleurisy. However, diagnosis is difficult and is based on mycobacteriology that is not enough sensitive and time-consuming, or on histology that requires invasive biopsy gesture. This literature review, carried out from Medline, summarizes the main meta-analyzes, reviews, and originator publications in English on biomarkers, classic and more innovative, studied for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. Among the immuno-biochemical markers, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), isoenzyme of adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) and total adenosine deaminase (ADA) seem the most relevant with respective sensitivities of 89% (87-91), 97.2% (95 to 98.7) and 92% (90-93) and specificities of 97% (96-98), 94.2% (91.8 to 96) and 90% (89-91). About molecular biology, PCR Xpert MTB/RIF has a sensitivity of 46.4% (26.3 to 67.8), which is much higher than the direct examination, while providing rapid diagnostic confirmation, with a specificity of 99.1% (95.2 to 99.8), and a resistance to rifampicin screening. The release assay of interferon-γ (IGRA) is less effective with a sensitivity of 75% (69-81) and a specificity of 82% (75-88) in blood and a sensitivity of 80% (74-86%) and a specificity of 72% (64-80) in pleural fluid. Other biomarkers (including several cytokines) might have an interest but are still under evaluation. These innovative methods, particularly the determination of ADA and the use of PCR Xpert MTB/RIF should find their place in the diagnostic algorithm of TB pleurisy.},

abstract={Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of severe anaemia in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in South Africa. However, TB can be difficult to diagnose as it may be extra pulmonary and paucibacillary. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate undiagnosed TB in patients with HIV infection and severe anaemia and to identify the optimal investigations for diagnosing TB. Setting: Mthatha General Hospital, a district hospital. Methods: The study was a case series. Results: Haemoglobin levels ranged from 3.6 g/dL to 7.9 g/dL, the mean CD4 count was 176 cells/μL and 80% of patients had a positive TB symptom screen. Forty-three (86%) patients had either clinical or bacteriologically proven TB of whom 33 had pulmonary TB, 34 had extra pulmonary TB and 24 had both types. The diagnostic yield for TB was: chest X-ray (CXR) 91%; ultrasound (US) abdomen pericardium and lower chest 62%; sputum Xpert MTB/RIF 35%; TB blood culture 21% and TB urine culture 15%. Blood and urine cultures did not identify any additional cases over those identified by CXR and US. The laboratory turnaround times were as follows: sputum Xpert, 1.6 days; blood culture, 20 days and urine culture, 28 days. CXR and US were done within one day of initial patient assessment. Conclusions: The majority of HIV patients with severe anaemia had TB disease, and extra pulmonary TB was as prevalent as pulmonary TB. CXR, US and sputum Xpert were the optimum tests for rapid diagnosis of TB. South African national TB/HIV guidelines should incorporate these specific tests to diagnose TB in patients with HIV and severe anaemia. © 2017. The Authors.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease which remains a global health problem till date. A number of cytokine and chemokine have been reported to be associated with MTB clearance, reactivation or cure but there are no consensus biomarkers to differentiate the severity of TB. In this study, we determined the changes in plasma C- reactive protein (C-RP) and Fibrinogen levels in Drug sensitive Tuberculosis (DSTB) patients at diagnosis, Multi drug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) patients at diagnosis and during chemotherapy. Twenty-four (24) patients MDRTB patients and 24 newly diagnosed DSTB patients from University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan, Nigeria were recruited for the study by a Consultant Chest physician using clinical history, Chest X-ray and GENE Xpert test. Five (5) milliliters of blood was drawn from the anti-cubital fossa vein into lithium heparin tubes before the commencement of chemotherapy, 2 months, 4 months and 6 months of anti-TB therapy. Plasma obtained was analyzed for C-RP and fibrinogen using ELISA. Data was presented as mean ± SD. Student t-test was used for mean comparison. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Mean CRP level in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis patients was significantly higher at diagnosis compared with controls. Mean fibrinogen levels in the drug sensitive and multi drug resistant tuberculosis were significantly lower at diagnosis compared to controls. The mean CRP and fibrinogen levels in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis were significantly reduced during chemotherapy compared with before commencement of chemotherapy. Plasma CRP and fibrinogen are suggested as possible markers for monitoring treatment response in MDRTB patients. © 2017, Ibadan Biomedical Communications Group. All rights reserved.},

M. tuberculosis was subsequently isolated from the gastric aspirate specimen. After 2 months of treatment with antituberculous medication, the patient developed alow grade fever and left-sided chest pain. A CT scan revealed a left pleural effusion and a right subphrenic abscess. Tuber-culous pleurisy with paradoxical response was diagnosed on the basis of an increased lymphocyte count and increased adenosine deaminase activity in the pleural fluid exudate. A percutaneous ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the sub-phrenic abscess was performed. Histological analysis revealed epithelioid cell granulomas with necrosis and PCR for M. tuberculosis using puncture needle washing fluid returned positive results. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of subphrenic abscess with paradoxical response, caused by M, tuberculosis, was made. Subphrenic abscess caused by M, tuberculosis is an important consideration during antituber-culous therapy.},

abstract={To better understand the host immune response involved in the progression from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) to active tuberculosis (TB) and identify the potential signatures for discriminating TB from LTBI, we performed a genomewide transcriptional profile of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.TB)-specific antigensstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with TB, LTBI individuals and healthy controls (HCs). A total of 209 and 234 differentially expressed genes were detected in TB vs. LTBI and TB vs. HCs, respectively. Nineteen differentially expressed genes with top fold change between TB and the other 2 groups were validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and showed 94.7% consistent expression pattern with microarray test. Six genes were selected for further validation in an independent sample set of 230 samples. Expression of the resistin (RETN) and kallikrein 1 (KLK1) genes showed the greatest difference between the TB and LTBI or HC groups (P < 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed that the areas under the curve (AUC) for RETN and KLK1 were 0.844 (0.783- 0.904) and 0.833 (0.769-0.897), respectively, when discriminating TB from LTBI. The combination of these two genes achieved the best discriminative capacity [AUC = 0.916 (0.872-0.961)], with a sensitivity of 71.2% (58.7%-81.7%) and a specificity of 93.6% (85.7%-97.9%). Our results provide a new potentially diagnostic signature for discriminating TB and LTBI and have important implications for better understanding the pathogenesis involved in the transition from latent infection to TB activation. © Pan et al.},

abstract={Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection has been regional outbreak, recently. The traditional focus on the patterns of “reductionism” which was associated with single molecular changes has been unable to meet the demand of early diagnosis and clinical application when current tuberculosis infection happened. In this study, we employed a systems biology approach to collect large microarray data sets including mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) to identify the differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs in the whole blood of TB patients. The aim was to identify key genes associated with the immune response in the pathogenic process of tuberculosis by analyzing the co-regulatory network that was consisted of transcription factors and miRNAs as well as their target genes. The network along with their co-regulatory genes was analyzed utilizing Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED) and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). We got 21 (19 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes that were co-regulated by transcription factors and miRNAs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the 21 differentially expressed genes were predominantly involved in Tuberculosis signaling pathway, which may play a major role in tuberculosis biological process. Quantitative realtime PCR was performed to verify the over expression of co-regulatory genes (FCGR1A and CEBPB). The genetic expression was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics in TB patients and inferences drawn. Our results suggest the TF-miRNA gene co-regulatory network may help us further understand the molecular mechanism of immune response to tuberculosis and provide us a new angle of future biomarker and therapeutic targets. © 2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

abstract={Background: The lack of effective means for the early diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of the high mortality associated with this form of lung cancer. This study aims to explore the potential significance of serum miRNA in the auxiliary diagnosis of NSCLC. Methods: The relative serum levels of 10 miRNAs in 120 patients with NSCLC, 45 patients with benign lung diseases, and 45 healthy controls were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were then used to analyze the significance of the expression of these 10 miRNAs in the diagnosis of NSCLC, as well as to compare them with the current commonly used tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Results: The serum levels of miR-125b and miR-22 in the NSCLC patients were significantly higher than those in the other two groups (p < 0.05), but the serum expression of miR-15b in the NSCLC patients was significantly lower than that in the other two groups (p < 0.01). The sensitivities of serum miR-22 and miR-15b in detecting early NSCLC (stage I + II) were significantly higher than that of CEA (p < 0.05). Area under the curves (AUCs) of serum miR-22, miR-125b, and miR-15b in the diagnosis of NSCLC were 0.725, 0.704, and 0.619, respectively, and the diagnostic significance of these three serum miRNAs for NSCLC was higher than that of serum CEA (AUC = 0.594). Conclusions: Serum miRNAs have potential as NSCLC-screening tumor markers, and serum miR-22 and miR-15b might be used as reference indexes for the early diagnosis of NSCLC in the future.},

abstract={Background Expansion of HIV viral load (VL) testing services are required to meet increased targets for monitoring patients on antiretroviral treatment. South Africa currently tests >4million VLs per annum in 16 highly centralised, automated high-throughput laboratories. The Xpert HIV-1 VL assay (Cepheid) was evaluated against in-country predicates, the Roche Cobas Taqmanv2 and Abbott HIV-1RT, to investigate options for expanding VL testing using GeneXpert's random access, polyvalent capabilities and already established footprint in South Africa with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (207 sites). Additionally, the performance of Xpert HIV-1VL on alternative, off-label specimen types, Dried Blood Spots (DBS) and whole blood, was investigated. Method Precision, accuracy (agreement) and clinical misclassification (1000cp/ml) of Xpert HIV-1VL plasma was compared to Taqmanv2 (n = 155) and Abbott HIV-1 RT (n = 145). Misclassification of Xpert HIV-1VL was further tested on DBS (n = 145) and whole blood (n = 147). Results Xpert HIV-1VL demonstrated 100% concordance with predicate platforms on a standardised frozen, plasma panel (n = 42) and low overall percentage similarity CV of 1.5% and 0.9% compared to Taqmanv2 and Abbott HIV-1 RT, respectively. On paired plasma clinical specimens, Xpert HIV-1VL had low bias (SD 0.32-0.37logcp/ml) and 3% misclassification at the 1000cp/ml threshold compared to Taqmanv2 (fresh) and Abbott HIV-1 RT (frozen), respectively. Xpert HIV-1VL on whole blood and DBS increased misclassification (upward) by up to 14% with increased invalid rate. All specimen testing was easy to perform and compatible with concurrent Xpert MTB/RIF Tuberculosis testing on the same instrument. Conclusion The Xpert HIV-1VL on plasma can be used interchangeably with existing predicate platforms in South Africa. Whole blood and DBS testing requires further investigation, but polyvalency of the GeneXpert offers a solution to extending VL testing services. © 2016 Gous et al.

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) is a common disease in Pakistan with 18 % of extra-pulmonary cases. Pakistan ranks fourth amongst high burden countries for TB in the world. Mediastinal involvement is rare in particular in the forms of lymphadenitis without lung damaging. The typology of the migration flows has modified the tuberculosis’ epidemiological distribution and the number of the extrapulmonary cases are increasing in Europe and in Italy. Diagnosis of mediastinal tuberculosis is difficult as the clinical presentation lacks specificity, imaging studies do not provide conclusive information and the differential diagnosis is a common challenge in clinical practice. The suspect of tuberculosis must be considered including acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining (Ziehl-Nielsen and auramine), cultures and nucleic acid technology methods. We report two cases of mediastinal tuberculosis without a pulmonary tuberculosis in immunocompetent patients. This last condition, makes our cases even more rare. The first case is a man of 48-years-old presented with syncope, arrhythmia and weight loss of 20 kg during the last four months. The second case is a man of 29-years-old presented with fever (102 °F), dry cough and nocturnal sweating. The process that lead to the diagnosis of mediastinal tuberculosis, particularly in immunocompetent patients and without a concurrent diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, is difficult to implement in a general clinical practice. These cases require a close examination of the differential diagnosis and the different and complex clinical pictures related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis must not be excluded. Moreover, it is needed to adopt and coordinate both mini-invasive diagnostic systems (e.g. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration, EBUS-TBNA) and mycobacterial tests (microscopy, cultures and nucleic acid amplification techniques, NAAT) able to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of tuberculosis with an acceptable precision. Our cases demonstrated the key role of mycobacterial cultures in the diagnosis of these rare forms of mediastinal tuberculosis. © 2016, Società Italiana di Patologia Clinica e Medicina di Laboratorio.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem. Patients with TB have a high rate of vitamin D deficiency, both at diagnosis and during the course of treatment with anti-tuberculosis drugs. Although data on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) clearance are uncertain from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), vitamin D enhances the expression of the anti-microbial peptide human cathelicidin (hCAP18) in cultured macrophages in vitro. One possible explanation for the mixed (primarily negative) results of RCTs examining vitamin D treatment in TB infection is that anti-TB drugs given to enrolled subjects may impact actions of vitamin D to enhance cathelicidin in macrophages. To address this hypothesis, human macrophage-like monocytic (THP-1) cells were treated with varying doses of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in the presence of the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3). The expression of hCAP18 was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 1,25(OH)2D3 strongly induced expression of hCAP18 mRNA in THP-1 cells (fold-change from control). The combination of the standard 4-drug TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) in the cultured THP-1 cells demonstrated a significant decrease in hCAP18 mRNA at the dosage of 10 µg/mL. In 31 subjects with newly diagnosed drug-sensitive TB randomized to either high-dose vitamin D3 (1.2 million IU over 8 weeks, n = 13) versus placebo (n = 18), there was no change from baseline to week 8 in hCAP18 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in plasma concentrations of LL-37, the protein product of hCAP18. These data suggest that first-line anti-TB drugs may alter the vitamin D-dependent increase in hCAP18 and LL-37 human macrophages. © 2016},

abstract={Background: Early mortality among HIV-positive adults starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains high in resource-limited settings, with tuberculosis (TB) the leading cause of death. However, current methods to estimate TB-related deaths are inadequate and most autopsy studies do not adequately represent those attending primary health clinics (PHCs). This study aimed to determine the autopsy prevalence of TB and other infections in adults enrolled at South African PHCs in the context of a pragmatic trial of empiric TB treatment ("TB Fast Track"). Methods and Findings: Adults with CD4≤150 cells/μL, not on ART or TB treatment, were enrolled to TB Fast Track and followed up for at least six months. Minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) was conducted as soon as possible after death. Lungs, liver, and spleen were biopsied; blood, CSF, and urine aspirated; and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained. Samples underwent mycobacterial, bacterial, and fungal culture; molecular testing (including Xpert® MTB/RIF); and histological examination. 34 MIAs were conducted: 18 (53%) decedents were female; median age was 39 (interquartile range 33-44) years; 25 (74%) deaths occurred in hospitals; median time from death to MIA was five (IQR 3-6) days. 16/34 (47%) had evidence of TB (14/16 [88%] with extrapulmonary disease; 6/16 [38%] not started on treatment antemortem); 23 (68%) had clinically important bacterial infections; four (12%) cryptococcal disease; three (9%) non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease; and two (6%) Pneumocystis pneumonia. Twenty decedents (59%) had evidence of two or more concurrent infections; 9/16 (56%) individuals with TB had evidence of bacterial disease and two (13%) cryptococcal disease. Conclusions: TB, followed by bacterial infections, were the leading findings at autopsy among adults with advanced HIV enrolled from primary care clinics. To reduce mortality, strategies are needed to identify and direct those at highest risk into a structured pathway that includes expedited investigation and/or treatment of TB and other infections. © 2016 Karat et al.

abstract={Objectives We evaluated the ability of the Xpert® MTB/RIF assay to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis in whole blood of children with tuberculosis in tuberculosis endemic settings with high rates of HIV infection. Methods From June 2011 to September 2012 we prospectively enrolled children with symptoms or signs suggestive of tuberculosis at three research centres in Tanzania and Uganda. After clinical assessment, respiratory specimens were collected for microscopy and culture, as well as whole blood for Xpert® MTB/RIF. Children were classified according to standardised case definitions. Results A total of 232 children were evaluated; 14 (6.0%) had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. The Xpert® MTB/RIF assay detected M. tuberculosis in 5/232 (2.2%) blood samples with 1 (0.4%) error reading and presumably 1 (0.4%) false-positive result. The sensitivity of the assay in children with culture-confirmed (1/14) versus no tuberculosis (1/117) was 7.1% (95% CI, 1.3–31.5). Three of the five Xpert® MTB/RIF positive patients had negative cultures, but were classified as probable tuberculosis cases. Assay sensitivity against a composite reference standard (culture-confirmed, highly probable or probable tuberculosis) was 5.4% (95% CI, 2.1–13.1). Conclusion Whole blood Xpert® MTB/RIF demonstrated very poor sensitivity, although it may enhance the diagnostic yield in select cases, with culture-negative tuberculosis. © 2016 The British Infection Association},

Despite its worldwide application, the IFN-γ assay has not been applied in Egypt. The aim of this study was to determine the appropriate cut-off value of IFN-γ assay to complement the skin test screening in Egypt. The relative sensitivity (Ser ) of PPD and antigen cocktail-based IFN-γ assays (IFN-γ-BA and IFN-γ-EC) was analysed retrospectively, relative to bTB confirmatory tests (culture and PCR), using single cervical tuberculin (SCT) test reactors during 2011-2013. The absolute specificity (Sp) was studied using blood samples collected from cattle from one bTB-free herd. Analysis of the bTB database-generated sheets indicates the infection rate had decreased from 2009 to 2012 and then increased in 2013. The disease is concentrated in the Egyptian Nile Delta and Valley relative to elsewhere in the country. The cut-offs for IFN-γ-EC assay could be optimized to provide higher sensitivity, comparable to cut-offs for IFN-γ-BA assay. Data analysis suggests (PPDbOD  > 0.1, PPDbOD  - NILOD  > 0.05 and PPDbOD  > PPDaOD ) and (ECOD  - NILOD  ≥ 0.1) cut-off strategies to get optimal IFN-γ-BA and IFN-γ-EC assays results respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the prevalence of bTB in cattle in Egypt and pointing out the appropriate cut-off criteria to optimize IFN-γ assay as a routine ancillary test for diagnosis of bTB in Egypt. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Background: Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of EPTB is challenging in resource-limited settings due to difficulties in obtaining samples, as well as the paucibacillarity of the specimens. Skeletal tuberculosis accounts for 10-35 % of EPTB cases, with vertebral osteomyelitis (Pott's disease) representing 50 % of the cases. We present two cases of suspected Pott's disease, diagnosed through GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay in urine at a rural Tanzanian hospital. Case Presentation: Case I A 49-year old male, HIV-1 positive, on co-formulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine/efavirenz since 2009 and CD4 counts of 205 cells/μL (13 %). He presented with lower back pain and progressive lower limb weakness for two weeks prior to admission. The physical examination revealed bilateral flaccid paraplegia with reduced reflexes, but otherwise unremarkable findings. A lateral lumbar X-ray showed noticeable reduction of intervertebral space between L4 and L5, and a small calcification in the anterior longitudinal ligament between L4 and L5, being compatible with focal spondylosis deformans but inconclusive with regard to tuberculous spondylitis. An abdominal ultrasound showed normal kidneys, bladder and prostate gland. The urinalysis and complete blood counts (CBC) were normal. M. Tuberculosis was detected through GeneXpert MTB/RIF in centrifuged urine, with no resistance to rifampicin. Case II A 76-year old female, HIV-1 negative, presented with lower back pain and progressive weakness and numbness of the lower limbs for two months prior to admission. The physical examination revealed paraplegia, but otherwise unremarkable findings. The lumbosacral X-ray findings were compatible with spondylosis deformans of the lumbar spine and possible tuberculous spondylitis in L3-L4. The abdominal and renal ultrasound showed normal kidneys and bladder. The urinalysis and CBC were normal. M. Tuberculosis was detected through GeneXpert MTB/RIF in centrifuged urine, with no resistance to rifampicin. Conclusion: We report two cases of suspected tuberculous spondylitis diagnosed through Xpert MTB/RIF in urine samples from a rural Tanzanian hospital. Urine testing using Xpert MTB/RIF reflects disseminated disease and renal involvement, and may offer a feasible additional diagnostic approach for Pott's disease in rural Africa. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Introduction: HIV infection is a risk factor for opportunistic pneumonias such as tuberculosis (TB) and for age-associated health complications. Short telomeres, markers of biological aging, are also associated with an increased risk of age-associated diseases and mortality. Our goals were to use a single cohort of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals hospitalized with pneumonia to assess whether shortened telomere length was associated with HIV infection, TB diagnosis, and 2-month mortality. Methods: This was a sub-study of the IHOP Study, a prospective observational study. Participants consisted of 184 adults admitted to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda who underwent evaluation for suspected TB and were followed for 2 months. Standardized questionnaires were administered to collect demographic and clinical data. PBMCs were isolated and analyzed using quantitative PCR to determine telomere length. The association between HIV infection, demographic and clinical characteristics, and telomere length was assessed, as were the associations between telomere length, TB diagnosis and 2-month mortality. Variables with a P≤0.2 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariate models. Results: No significant demographic or clinical differences were observed between the HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects. Older age (P<0.0001), male gender (P = 0.04), total pack-years smoked (P<0.001), alcohol consumption in the past year (P = 0.12), and asthma (P = 0.08) were all associated (P<0.2) with shorter telomere length in bivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis adjusting for these five variables, HIV-positive participants had significantly shorter telomeres than HIV-negative participants (β = -0.0621, 95% CI -0.113 to -0.011, P = 0.02). Shortened telomeres were not associated with TB or short-term mortality. Conclusions: The association between HIV infection and shorter telomeres suggests that HIV may play a role in cellular senescence and biological aging and that shorter telomeres may be involved in age-associated health complications seen in this population. The findings indicate a need to further research the impact of HIV on aging. © 2016 Auld et al.

abstract={Aim: A cross-sectional study was undertaken to know the herd prevalence and evaluate the single intradermal tuberculin testing (SITT), culture isolation, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis (TB). Materials and Methods: A total of 541 cows of three dairy farms of Bareilly and Mukteshwar were screened by SITT followed by collection of pre-scapular lymph node (PSLN) aspirates (71), milk (54), and blood (71) samples from reactor animals. These clinical samples were processed for culture isolation and direct PCR-based identification and species differentiation. Results: Out of 541 cows screened by SITT, 71 (13.12%) animals were found positive. Mycobacteria were isolated from 3 (4.22%) PSLN aspirate but not from any cultured milk and blood samples. 28 (39.43%) PSLN aspirate and 5 (9.25%) milk samples were positive for Mycobacterium TB (MTB) complex (MTC) by PCR amplification for the IS6110 insertion sequence; however, blood samples were found negative. For species differentiation, multiplex-PCR using 12.7 kb primers was conducted. Out of 28 PSLN aspirate, Mycobacterium bovis was detected in 18 (64.28%) and MTB in 8 (28.57%), whereas 2 aspirate samples (7.14%) were positive for both the species. All the five milk positive samples were positive for M. bovis. Conclusion: Direct detection of bovine TB by a molecular-based method in dairy animals after preliminary screening was appeared to be more sensitive and specific compared to the conventional method (i.e., culture isolation). Its application in form of serial testing methodology for the routine diagnosis and thereafter, culling of infected stock may be suggested for the control programs in dairy herds. The PSLN aspirate was found to be the most suitable specimen for culture isolation and PCR-based detection of Mycobacterium spp. among live infected animals. © Thakur, et al.},

abstract={S E T T ING: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. In Zambia, smear microscopy and chest radiography (CXR) are the primary TB diagnostic tools, and most cases are not bacteriologically confirmed. OBJECTIVE : We implemented enhanced screening to determine the TB burden among new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinic enrollees. DESIGN: Consecutive adult HIV clinic enrollees were screened, regardless of symptoms. All underwent microscopy (Ziehl-Neelsen/fluorescence microscopy) on three sputum specimens, physical examination, and digital CXR. Sputum, blood and urine specimens were cultured. Xpert® MTB/RIF testing was performed retrospectively. RESULT S : From July 2011 to April 2012, 399 patients were enrolled. The median age was 34.4 years; body mass index was 20.8 kg/m2, CD4 count was 202 cells/ll and 86% were symptomatic. Culture-confirmed TB was diagnosed in 72/399 (18%) patients; an additional 31/ 399 (8%) were culture-negative but diagnosed clinically. Symptom screening for any cough, fever, weight loss or night sweats had high sensitivity (95%) but low specificity (14%) for detecting culture-confirmed cases. Among culture-confirmed cases, 35/72 (49%) were missed clinically and detected only by culture. Xpert was 64% sensitive and 98% specific. CONCLUS IONS : High TB prevalence was found in Zambians newly enrolled into HIV care. Screening with sensitive diagnostics should be considered with culture when feasible in this population. © 2016 The Union.},

abstract={PCR is the most sensitive molecular diagnostic available for infectious diseases. The goal for low-resource settings is a simple, inexpensive instrument. Toward this goal, we previously published a self-contained sample preparation instrument that uses magnetics and prearrayed reagents in thin tubing to extract nucleic acids and perform isothermal amplification and detection of extracted biomarkers. To incorporate PCR thermal cycling, after biomarker is magnetically extracted from a patient sample, the section of tubing containing the extracted biomarker and PCR reagents is alternately positioned within two constant temperature blocks. This instrument was evaluated initially by extracting and amplifying a 140 bp fragment of the IS6110 sequence of tuberculosis from TE buffer. The mean cycle threshold for 5 × 106 copies of IS6110 was 25.5 ± 1.5 cycles (n = 4), which was significantly different from negative control samples (34.0 ± 2.6 cycles; n = 3). Using a more clinically relevant sample, we extracted and amplified Plasmodium falciparum DNA from malaria-infected human blood cultures. The average cycle threshold for 1% parasitemia samples was 24.7 ± 1.5 cycles (n = 3) and significantly different from negatives (31.5 ± 2.1 cycles; n = 3). This approach integrates biomarker extraction, PCR amplification, and detection in a simple, linear tubing design with potential for use as a low-resource instrument. © 2016, © 2016 Society for Laboratory Automation and Screening.},

PCR is a very sensitive method for detection of infectious agents, but the sensitivity of molecular diagnosis is largely dependent on the efficiency of the DNA extraction methods. The objective of this study was to evaluate DNA extraction methods for direct detection of Mycobacterium bovis in bovine tissue. Nine commercial kits for DNA extraction were evaluated when combined with two real time PCRs. The DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit from QIAGEN showed better performance and sensitivity followed by the DNA Mini Kit RBC and FTA Elute Micro Card. Results suggested that, even when the analytical sensitivity of the qPCR is very high, the extraction method can influence the diagnostic sensitivity. © 2016, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria.

abstract={Objective: Rare disease Background: Pott’s disease (PD) or spinal tuberculosis is a rare condition which accounts for less than 1% of total tuberculosis (TB) cases. The incidence of PD has recently increased in Europe and the United States, mainly due to immigration; however, it is still a rare diagnosis in Scandinavian countries, and if overlooked it might lead to significant neurologic complications. Case Report: A 78-year-old woman, originally from Eastern Europe, presented to the emergency department with a complaint of nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and severe back pain. On admission she was febrile and had leukocytosis and increased C-reactive protein. Initial spinal x-ray was performed and revealed osteolytic changes in the vertebral body of T11 and T12. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine illustrated spondylitis of T10, T11, and T12, with multiple paravertebral and epidural abscesses, which was suggestive of PD. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the patient’s gastric fluid was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT). Based on MRI and PCR findings, standard treatment for TB was initiated. Results of the spine biopsy and culture showed colonies of MT and confirmed the diagnosis afterwards. Due to the instability of the spine and severe and continuous pain, spine-stabilizing surgery was performed. Her TB was cured after nine months of treatment. Conclusions: PD is an important differential diagnosis of malignancy that should be diagnosed instantly. History of exposure to TB and classic radiologic finding can help make the diagnosis. © Am J Case Rep.},

abstract={Background Identification of blood biomarkers that prospectively predict progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease might lead to interventions that combat the tuberculosis epidemic. We aimed to assess whether global gene expression measured in whole blood of healthy people allowed identification of prospective signatures of risk of active tuberculosis disease. Methods In this prospective cohort study, we followed up healthy, South African adolescents aged 12–18 years from the adolescent cohort study (ACS) who were infected with M tuberculosis for 2 years. We collected blood samples from study participants every 6 months and monitored the adolescents for progression to tuberculosis disease. A prospective signature of risk was derived from whole blood RNA sequencing data by comparing participants who developed active tuberculosis disease (progressors) with those who remained healthy (matched controls). After adaptation to multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), the signature was used to predict tuberculosis disease in untouched adolescent samples and in samples from independent cohorts of South African and Gambian adult progressors and controls. Participants of the independent cohorts were household contacts of adults with active pulmonary tuberculosis disease. Findings Between July 6, 2005, and April 23, 2007, we enrolled 6363 participants from the ACS study and 4466 from independent South African and Gambian cohorts. 46 progressors and 107 matched controls were identified in the ACS cohort. A 16 gene signature of risk was identified. The signature predicted tuberculosis progression with a sensitivity of 66·1% (95% CI 63·2–68·9) and a specificity of 80·6% (79·2–82·0) in the 12 months preceding tuberculosis diagnosis. The risk signature was validated in an untouched group of adolescents (p=0·018 for RNA sequencing and p=0·0095 for qRT-PCR) and in the independent South African and Gambian cohorts (p values <0·0001 by qRT-PCR) with a sensitivity of 53·7% (42·6–64·3) and a specificity of 82·8% (76·7–86) in the 12 months preceding tuberculosis. Interpretation The whole blood tuberculosis risk signature prospectively identified people at risk of developing active tuberculosis, opening the possibility for targeted intervention to prevent the disease.

abstract={Diagnosis of tuberculosis in children is challenging; even with advanced technologies, the diagnosis is often difficult to confirm microbiologically in part due to the paucibacillary nature of the disease. Clinical diagnosis lacks standardization, and traditional and molecular microbiologic methods lack sensitivity, particularly in children. Immunodiagnostic tests may improve sensitivity, but these tests cannot distinguish tuberculosis disease from latent infection and some lack specificity. While molecular tools like Xpert MTB/RIF have advanced our ability to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to determine antimicrobial resistance, decades old technologies remain the standard in most locales.

abstract={AIM: To investigate the expression pattern of plasma long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in Chrohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Microarray screening and qRT-PCR verification of lncRNAs and mRNAs were performed in CD and control subjects, followed by hierarchy cluster ing, GO and KEGG pathway analyses. Significantly dysregulated lncRNAs were categorized into subgroups of antisense lncRNAs, enhancer lncRNAs and lincRNAs. To predict the regulatory effect of lncRNAs on mRNAs, a CNC network analysis was performed and cross linked with significantly changed lncRNAs. The overlapping lncRNAs were randomly selected and verified by qRT-PCR in a larger cohort. RESULTS: Initially, there were 1211 up-regulated and 777 down-regulated lncRNAs as well as 1020 up-regulated and 953 down-regulated mRNAs after microarray analysis; a heat map based on these results showed good categorization into the CD and control groups. GUSBP2 and AF113016 had the highest fold change of the up- And down-regulated lncRNAs, whereas TBC1D17 and CCL3L3 had the highest foldchange of the up- And down-regulated mRNAs. Six (SNX1, CYFIP2, CD6, CMTM8, STAT4 and IGFBP7) of 10 mRNAs and 8 (NR-033913, NR-038218, NR-036512, NR-049759, NR-033951, NR-045408, NR-038377 and NR-039976) of 14 lncRNAs showed the same change trends on the microarray and qRT-PCR results with statistical significance. Based on the qRT-PCR verified mRNAs, 1358 potential lncRNAs with 2697 positive correlations and 2287 negative correlations were predicted by the CNC network. CONCLUSION: The plasma lncRNAs profiles provide preliminary data for the non-invasive diagnosis of CD and a resource for further specific lncRNA-mRNA pathway exploration. © 2016 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

abstract={Objective: To express heparin-binding haemagglutinin adhesin (HBHA) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) in prokaryotic cells, purify the recombinant protein and evaluate its significance in serological diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). Methods: The hbha gene was amplified from the genome of M. tb H37Rv by PCR and cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET-28a (+). The constructed recombinant plasmid pET-28ah was transformed to E. coli BL2l(DE3) for expression under induction of IPTG. The expressed recombinant HBHA (rHBHA) was purified by nickel ion affinity chromatography and analyzed for antigenic specificity by Western blot. Serum samples were collected from 71 patients with TB and 30 healthy volunteers, and determined for IgA and IgG levels against HBHA by ELISA, based on which the significance of rHBHA in serological diagnosis of TB was evaluated using ESAT-6 and Ag85A as control antigens. Results: Both restriction analysis and sequencing proved that recombinant plasmid pET-28ah was constructed correctly. The expressed recombinant HBHA mainly existed in a form of inclusion body, and reached a high purity after purification by nickel ion affinity chromatography. The purified HBHA showed specific binding to mouse anti-His tag monoclonal antibody. The IgG levels against rHBHA, ESAT-6 and Ag85A as well as IgA level against rHBHA in patients with TB were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers as control (P < 0. 05). However, the IgA levels against ESAT-6 and Ag85A in two groups showed no significant difference (P < 0. 05). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve showed good diagnostic effect of rHBHA-specific IgA assay with AUC of 0. 711, which was superior to those of ESAT-6 (0. 512) and Ag85A (0. 531). Conclusion: Recombinant HBHA was showed good efficiency in diagnosis of TB, which might be used as a candidate antigen for serological diagnosis of the disease.},

abstract={Recently, Micro Electro-Mechanical systems (MEMS) have been vital in molecular diagnosis. In this paper, micro-cantilever beam based bio-sensing system is designed and analyzed for the detection of bio-molecules. Modal and static analysis is performed to study the vibration frequencies and deflection of cantilever respectively. The surface of the cantilever is coated with the anti-bodies of the suspected antigen in a patient's blood. The anti-bodies are specific for specific antigens. Hence, the presence of mycobacterium tuberculosis in a suspected patient's blood is identified through the deflection of cantilever beam. The deflection of the beam is detected using capacitance method. 3D finite element analysis is performed to study the stability, sensitivity and modal frequencies of the cantilever beam(s). The modal frequencies are very important in vibration to voltage conversion of a capacitor for deflection detection. Fixed beam and stepped beam are also considered for comparison. The model is found to be cost effective as well as simple when compared to the conventional techniques like ELISA and PCR. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is a neglected disease that has been restricted to East Africa for many decades. Several cases in refugees from the Horn of Africa have been recently diagnosed in four European countries. Case presentation: We report four additional cases of LBRF in asylum seekers from Somalia and Eritrea who presented with fever shortly after arriving in Switzerland during a seven-month period. Multiple spirochetes were visualized on stained blood films which were identified as Borrelia recurrentis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. All patients recovered after antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone and/or doxycycline. Concurrent infections (malaria and tuberculosis) were diagnosed in half of our patients. Possible modes of transmission and preventive measures are discussed. Conclusions: These reported cases highlight the ongoing transmission of LBRF in migrants from East Africa. Diagnosis of LBRF cases and prevention of autochthonous transmission in asylum seeker camps are important steps for the near future. © 2016 Osthoff et al.},

abstract={Molecular diagnostic tests have been the single major development in pneumonia diagnostics over recent years. Nucleic acid detection tests (NATs) have greatly improved the ability to detect respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens that do not normally colonize the respiratory tract. In contrast, NATs do not yet have an established role for diagnosing pneumonia caused by bacteria that commonly colonize the nasopharynx due to difficulties discriminating between pathogens and coincidental carriage strains. New approaches are needed to distinguish infection from colonization, such as through use of quantitative methods and identification of discriminating cut-off levels. The recent realization that the lung microbiome exists has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of pneumonia involving the interaction between multiple microorganisms. New developments in molecular diagnostics must account for this new paradigm. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={Objectives: Early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is essential for a positive outcome, but sensitive, specific, and rapid diagnostic tests for TBM are lacking. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays in HIV-uninfected patients with suspected TBM. Methods: All HIV-uninfected patients with suspected TBM were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary care hospital in an intermediate TB-burden country, during a 6-year period. ELISPOT assays were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and cerebrospinal fluid-mononuclear cells (CSF-MC). Results: Of the 276 evaluable patients, 90 (33%) were classified as having TBM (30 definite cases, 19 probable, and 41 possible), and 186 (67%) as having non-TBM. When comparing definite TBM versus non-TBM, the sensitivity and specificity of the PBMC ELISPOT assay (≥6 spots; manufacturer's recommended cut-off) for diagnosing TBM were 96% (95% CI, 82-100) and 58% (95% CI, 50-66), respectively. The CSF-MC ELISPOT assay (≥38 spots; receiver operating characteristic [ROC]-derived cut-off) was a useful rule-in test with specificity of 95% (96% CI, 90-98). Its sensitivity was 68% (95% CI, 45-86), which was superior those of AFB smear microscopy (14%; P < 0.001) and CSF Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR (41%; P = 0.07). Combining this assay with M. tuberculosis PCR, clinical score, and both together increased sensitivity to 86%, 91%, and 95%, respectively, while retaining about 95% specificity. Conclusions: The CSF-MC ELISPOT assay appears to be a rapid and accurate rule-in test for the diagnosis of TBM and a useful adjunct for diagnosing TBM in HIV-uninfected patients. © 2016 The British Infection Association.},

abstract={Background In children, integration of HIV in MNCH services has been shown to incr. ease uptake of early infant diagnosis. This article examines bottlenecks and opportunities for scaling up integrated pediatric HIV services in Nepal. Methods This is a descriptive study using both mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, conducted in January 2015 in 19 facilities in five regions of Nepal most affected by HIV epidemic. The qualitative methods comprised in-depth structured interviews with key informants (leadership of The National Center for AIDS and STD Control and National Public Health Laboratory, district management teams, medical officers in charge of health facilities and HIV clinics, frontline staff at antenatal care and HIV clinics and laboratory). The quantitative methods were used to abstract data of HIV-infected pregnant women seen between January and December 2014, HIV-exposed infants aged less than 12 months, and HIV infected children aged less than 15 years who were initiated HIV treatment from 2010 to 2014. Structured tools were used to collect data which were analysed using IBM SPSS. Results Of the 19 facilities assessed, 18(98%), 18(98%), 14(75%), and 11(58%) provided prevention of mother-Tochild transmission (PMTCT), Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), pediatric ART and nutrition rehabilitation services, respectively. However, only 1(5%) facility collected onsite dried blood spots (DBS) for PCR HIV testing and 6(32%) facilities provided counselling and referral for DBS. In 2014, of the 121 HIV-exposed infants recorded, only 21(17%) received PCR test. The median turnaround time of the PCR test results was 54 days. Of the 21 records with PCR test, 11(52.5%) were from PMTCT clinics, 7(33%) from Nutritional rehabilitation clinics, and 3(14.5%) from pediatric outpatient clinic. Conversely, 934 children were initiated ART between 2010 and 2014, of which 5% were infants and 29% aged between 1 and 5 years. 298(32%) had comorbidities of which 64% had malnutrition. A total of 534(57%) had tuberculosis (TB) status assessed of which 58(11%) had active TB. Infants had lowest retention (63%), high mortality (17.4%), and loss to follow-up (10.9%). Conclusion Few facilities collect DBS and few children receive PCR tests with limited linkage to ART. This has led to late ART initiation, comorbidities, including TB coinfections and poor outcomes. The results indicate that there are opportunities for improving HIV case finding among HIV-exposed infants in PMTCT, EPI, TB, and nutrition services if provider initiated testing and counselling at the point of service delivery is institutionalized in these settings.},

abstract={Background: Control of the global burden of tuberculosis is obstructed due to lack of simple, rapid and cost effective diagnostic techniques that can be used in resource poor-settings. To facilitate the early diagnosis of TB directly from clinical specimens, we have standardized and validated the use of nested multiplex PCR, targeting gene fragments IS6110, MTP40 and 32kD α-antigen encoding genes specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and non-tubercular mycobacteria (NTM), in comparison to smear microscopy, solid culture and single step multiplex PCR. The results were evaluated in comparison to a composite reference standard (CRS) comprising of microbiological results (smear and culture), clinical, radiological and cytopathological findings, clinical treatment and response to anti-tubercular therapy. Methods: The nested multiplex PCR (nMPCR) assay was evaluated to test its utility in 600 (535 pulmonary and 65 extra-pulmonary specimens) clinically suspected TB cases. All specimens were processed for smear, culture, single step multiplex PCR and nested multiplex PCR testing. Results: Out of 535 screened pulmonary and 65 extra-pulmonary specimens, 329 (61.5 %) and 19 (29.2 %) cases were culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Based on CRS, 450 patients had "clinical TB" (definitive-TB, probable-TB and possible-TB). Remaining 150 were confirmed "non-TB" cases. For culture, the sensitivity was low, 79.3 % for pulmonary and 54.3 % for extra-pulmonary cases. The sensitivity and specificity results for nMPCR test were evaluated taken composite reference standard as a gold standard. The sensitivity of the nMPCR assay was 97.1 % for pulmonary and 91.4 % for extra-pulmonary TB cases with specificity of 100 % and 93.3 % respectively. Conclusion: Nested multiplex PCR using three gene primers is a rapid, reliable and highly sensitive and specific diagnostic technique for the detection and differentiation of M. tuberculosis complex from NTM genome and will be useful in diagnosing paucibacillary samples. Nested multiplex PCR assay was found to be better than single step multiplex PCR for assessing the diagnosis of TB. © 2016 Sinha et al.},

abstract={Parasitological methods for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) require invasive sampling procedures. The aim of this study was to detect Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) DNA by real time-PCR method in peripheral blood of symptomatic VL patient and compared its performance with nested PCR, an established molecular method with very high diagnostic indices. 47 parasitologically confirmed VL patients diagnosed by direct agglutination test (DAT > 3200), bone marrow aspiration and presented characteristic clinical features (fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia) and 40 controls (non-endemic healthy control-30, Malaria-2, Toxoplasma gondii-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-2, HBV-1, HCV-1, HSV-1 and CMV-1) were enrolled in this study. SYBR-green based real time-PCR and nested PCR was performed to amplify the Kinetoplast DNA minicircle gene using the DNA extracted from Buffy coat. From among 47 patients, 45 (95.7 %) were positive by both nested-PCR and real time-PCR. These results indicate that real time-PCR was not only as sensitive as a nested-PCR assay for detection of Leishmania kDNA in clinical sample, but also more rapid. The advantage of real time-PCR based methods over nested-PCR is simple to perform, more faster in which nested-PCR requires post-PCR processing and reducing contamination risk. © 2014, Indian Society for Parasitology.},

abstract={Introduction: Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be located in every organ of the human body developing specific tuberculosis histopathological aspects. Hepatic and splenic tuberculosis may be suspected in immunocompromised patients with hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, fever and elevated liver enzymes. Diagnosis is confirmed by culture of a pathological sample or by histological examination of a biopsy of the affected tissue or organ for M. tuberculosis. Case report: 21 years old female known with HIV Infection Category C3 (CD4 -10 cells / mm3), treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) since November 2014, diagnosed in January 2015 with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy, tetra-ataxia, tetra paresis and secondary epilepsy with repeated admissions to an Infectious Department of our hospital for prolonged febrile syndrome, nausea and weight loss is thoroughly investigated for hepatosplenic abscesses identified by CT-scan. In May 2015 a liver biopsy performed in a Hospital in Bucharest and Real Time PCR identified M. tuberculosis 610,000 copies/ml and Rifampicin resistance gene present. Culture confirmed M. tuberculosis. Extended DST (after 60 days) revealed sensitivity just for Ethionamide - tuberculosis XDR (extensively resistant). Initial treatment with tuberculosis drugs according to regimen WHO category 1 was individualized for the identified resistances. ART was also modified because of resistance to Rifampicin. Her condition slowly improved with fever remission and improvement of biological inflammatory syndrome and neurological manifestations associating physical therapy and specialized treatment. Conclusions: Extremely rare and very serious case of XDR TB with atypical localizations due to marked immunodeficiency. It represents a therapeutic challenge involving a multidisciplinary team and prolonged admissions in many specialized departments. Copyright © 2016 CELSIUS.},

Risk factors possibly associated with bovine tuberculosis (BTB) were also evaluated. Results: Of the 802 samples analyzed, one milk (0.25 %) and eight blood (2 %) samples were positive for M. bovis in the qPCR and their identities were confirmed by sequencing. Animals positive for M. bovis were found in six (30 %) of the 20 properties visited. None of the risk factors evaluated were statistically associated with BTB. Conclusions:M. bovis DNA was detected in one milk sample what may pose a risk to public health because raw milk is commonly consumed in Brazil. © 2016 da Silva Cezar et al.},

abstract={There is an urgent need for new tools to combat the ongoing tuberculosis (TB) pandemic. Gene expression profiles based on blood signatures have proved useful in identifying genes that enable classification of TB patients, but have thus far been complex. Using real-time PCR analysis, we evaluated the expression profiles from a large panel of genes in TB patients and healthy individuals in an Indian cohort. Classification models were built and validated for their capacity to discriminate samples from TB patients and controls within this cohort and on external independent gene expression datasets. A combination of only four genes distinguished TB patients from healthy individuals in both cross-validations and on separate validation datasets with very high accuracy. An external validation on two distinct cohorts using a real-time PCR setting confirmed the predictive power of this 4-gene tool reaching sensitivity scores of 88% with a specificity of around 75%. Moreover, this gene signature demonstrated good classification power in HIV+ populations and also between TB and several other pulmonary diseases. Here we present proof of concept that our 4-gene signature and the top classifier genes from our models provide excellent candidates for the development of molecular point-of-care TB diagnosis in endemic areas. © 2016 EMBO.},

abstract={Background: The occurrence of non-contiguous, multiple, and remote involvement tuberculous spondylitis is rare. The clinical presentation in patients with multifocal musculoskeletal tuberculosis may closely mimic that in patients with multiple bone metastases, which makes the accurate clinical diagnosis challenging. Herein, we report a multifocal musculoskeletal tuberculosis case that was misdiagnosed for 8 months as multiple bone metastases. Case presentation: A 63-year-old male farmer of Chinese Han ethnicity presented to us with pain in left side of the neck, right side of the chest and the back for 10 months without typical tuberculosis symptoms. His past medical history, the CT and fluoroscopy-guided biopsy were negative for tuberculosis. Interferon gamma by T-SPOT was also negative. Radiological findings including CT, MRI and PET-CT suggested that the patient had multiple metastases. Accordingly, the patient was misdiagnosed as having musculoskeletal tumors until a swelling under the right nipple ulcerated. The smear test for acid-fast bacilli and the PCR test for TB-DNA of the pus from the swollen area were both positive, leading to the final correct diagnosis of musculoskeletal tuberculosis. Conclusion: The proper diagnosis of musculoskeletal tuberculosis is clinically challenging due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis variants involved and atypical presentations, especially when the lesions are multiple. Our findings indicate that multiple tuberculous spondylitis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of multiple musculoskeletal lesions. © 2016 Ye et al.},

abstract={Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease in that 90 % of those latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis present no symptoms, but possess a 10 % lifetime chance of developing active TB. To prevent the spread of the disease, early diagnosis is crucial. However, current methods of detection require improvement in sensitivity, efficiency or specificity. In the present study, we conducted a microarray experiment, comparing the gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells among individuals with active TB, latent infection, and healthy conditions in a Taiwanese population. Results: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that most of the differentially expressed genes belonged to immune responses, inflammation pathways, and cell cycle control. Subsequent RT-PCR validation identified four differentially expressed genes, NEMF, ASUN, DHX29, and PTPRC, as potential biomarkers for the detection of active and latent TB infections. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the expression level of PTPRC may discriminate active TB patients from healthy individuals, while ASUN could differentiate between the latent state of TB infection and healthy condidtion. In contrast, DHX29 may be used to identify latently infected individuals among active TB patients or healthy individuals. To test the concept of using these biomarkers as diagnostic support, we constructed classification models using these candidate biomarkers and found the Naïve Bayes-based model built with ASUN, DHX29, and PTPRC to yield the best performance. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that gene expression profiles in the blood can be used to identify not only active TB patients, but also to differentiate latently infected patients from their healthy counterparts. Validation of the constructed computational model in a larger sample size would confirm the reliability of the biomarkers and facilitate the development of a cost-effective and sensitive molecular diagnostic platform for TB. © 2015 Lee et al.},

abstract={A novel indirect immuno-polymerase chain reaction (I-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of circulating anti-Ag85B (antigen 85B, Rv1886c), anti-ESAT-6 (early secretory antigenic target-6, Rv3875) and anti-cord factor (trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate) antibodies from the sera samples of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) patients and the results were compared with an analogous enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We covalently attached the amino-modified reporter DNA to the dithiothreitol (DTT)-reduced anti-human IgG antibody through a chemical linker succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). The detection of cocktail of anti-Ag85B, anti-ESAT-6 and anti-cord factor antibodies was found to be superior to the detection of individual antibodies. The sensitivities of 89.5% and 77.5% with I-PCR and 70.8% and 65% with ELISA were observed in smear-positive and smear-negative PTB cases, respectively with high specificity (90.9%). On the other hand, a sensitivity of 77.5% with I-PCR and 65% with ELISA was observed in EBTB cases. The detection of cocktail of antibodies by I-PCR is likely to improve the utility of existing algorithms for TB diagnosis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Laboratory investigation revealed pancytopenia (white blood cells, 2,020 cells/ μL; hemoglobin, 10.2 g/dL; platelets, 52,000 cells/μL), hypertriglyceridemia (229 mg/dL), and hyperferritinemia (1,420 ng/mL). Bone marrow biopsy showed a hypocellular bone marrow with a large numbers of histiocytes and marked hemophagocytosis; based on these findings, she was diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with both the bone marrow aspiration and sputum samples revealed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antitubercular therapy with immune modulation therapy including dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated. The results of all laboratory tests including bone marrow biopsy and PCR with both the bone marrow aspiration and sputum samples were normalized after treatment. Thus, early bone marrow biopsy and the use of techniques such as PCR can avoid delays in diagnosis and improve the survival rates of patients with tuberculosis-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. © 2016 by The Korean Pediatric Society.},

abstract={The decision to treat active tuberculosis (TB) is dependent on microbiological tests for the organism or evidence of disease compatible with TB in people with a high demographic risk of exposure. The tuberculin skin test and peripheral blood interferon-γ release assays do not distinguish active TB from a cleared or latent infection. Microbiological culture of mycobacteria is slow. Moreover, the sensitivities of culture and microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and nucleic acid detection by PCR are often compromised by difficulty in obtaining samples from the site of disease. Consequently, we need sensitive and rapid tests for easily obtained clinical samples, which can be deployed to assess patients exposed to TB, discriminate TB from other infectious, inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, and to identify subclinical TB in HIV-1 infected patients prior to commencing antiretroviral therapy. We discuss the evaluation of peripheral blood transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to develop the next generation of rapid diagnostics for active TB. We catalogue the studies published to date seeking to discriminate active TB from healthy volunteers, patients with latent infection and those with other diseases. We identify the limitations of these studies and the barriers to their adoption in clinical practice. In so doing, we aim to develop a framework to guide our approach to discovery and development of diagnostic biomarkers for active TB. � 2016 Haas et al.},

abstract={The epidemic of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) presented a major challenge for TB treatment today. We performed iTRAQ labeling coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) and Solexa sequencing among MDR-TB patients, drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) patients, and healthy controls. A total of 50 differentially expressed proteins and 43 differentially expressed miRNAs (fold change >1.50 or <0.60, P<0.05) were identified in the MDR-TB patients compared to both DS-TB patients and healthy controls. We found that 22.00% of differentially expressed proteins and 32.56% of differentially expressed miRNAs were related, and could construct a network mainly in complement and coagulation cascades. Significant differences in CD44 antigen (CD44), coagulation factor XI (F11), kininogen-1 (KNG1), miR-4433b-5p, miR-424-5p, and miR-199b-5p were found among MDR-TB patients, DS-TB patients and healthy controls (P<0.05) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SYBR green qRT-PCR validation. A strong negative correlation, consistent with the target gene prediction, was found between miR-199b-5p and KNG1 (r=-0.232, P=0.017). Moreover, we established the MDR-TB diagnostic model based on five biomarkers (CD44, KNG1, miR-4433b-5p, miR-424-5p, and miR-199b-5p). Our study proposes potential biomarkers for MDR-TB diagnosis, and also provides a new experimental basis to understand the pathogenesis of MDR-TB. © Ivyspring International Publisher.},

abstract={A 3-year-old girl child presented with swelling in her right lower jaw that had started 5 days previously. History revealed the child being non-immunised. Initial-evaluation revealed proptosis and bony hard swelling over the right body of the mandible. Radiological evaluation including a CT scan indicated expansile osteolytic lesion involving the body-ramus with onion-peel periosteal reaction suggesting osteomyelitis/malignancy. Blood investigations showed raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and eosinophilia. Family screening for tuberculosis (TB) revealed that the patient, her father and siblings were PPD positive though chest screening and sputum examinations were negative in all of them. Lesion biopsy showed acute/chronic osteomyelitis with eosinophilia, tilting diagnosis towards eosinophilic granuloma/Hand-Schuller-Christian disease. Further investigations for diabetes insipidus, histiocytosis-X, skull-pelvic-femur radiographs, abdominal ultrasonography, ophthalmic consultation and PCR-TB test were negative. Histology, radiography, purified protein derivative (PPD)-positive result and history led to the diagnosis of primary TB of the mandible. Complete resolution occurred following antitubercular therapy. The case report emphasises that diagnosis of TB can sometimes be based on circumstantial evidence and positive response to antitubercular therapy even in view of a negative PCR result. © 2016 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.},

abstract={In order to diagnose TB infection, tuberculin skin test and interferon gamma release assay are available. The tuberculin test has a sensitivity of 99 % and a specificity of 95 %. For the detection of interferon gamma in blood there are currently two tests available: TBGold QuantiFERON-In-Tube (with a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.90), and T-SPOT-TB (sensitivity 0.90 and specificity 0.93). To diagnose the disease, a microscopy of direct smears for acid-fast bacilli is used if the physician is facing an extensive cavitary lung disease due to M. tuberculosis (this test has a high sensitivity: 80-90 %). The most common staining techniques used are Ziehl-Neelsen and Kinyoun, and the fluorescent technique, auramine-rhodamine. The culture is the gold standard and it has a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity over 90 %, but the results take weeks. The nucleic acid amplification test has an overall sensitivity and specificity of 0.85 and 0.97, respectively. In the presence of a pleural effusion is necessary to perform a pleural biopsy for culture with a sensitivity of 85 % if it is percutaneous and 98 % if it was taken by thoracoscopy. The adenosine deaminase can be determined in pleural fluid with a sensitivity and specificity of 95 %.

abstract={We investigated the diagnostic values of microRNA-31 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis in Chinese patients. Sixty-five children with TB were selected for this study, which was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases People’s Hospital of Laiwu City between December 2013 and December 2014. Sixty healthy children, selected in parallel, served as the control group. Real-time PCR was used to detect miR-31 expression in PBMCs. Serum levels of IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB, and IFN-γ was detected by ELISA. ROC curve was employed to evaluate the diagnostic value of miR-31 in pediatric TB. Results show that expression of miRNA-31 in pediatric TB patients was significantly lower than that in normal children (0.48 ± 0.15 vs 1.23 ± 0.36, P < 0.05). By contrast, serum levels of the innate immune response cytokines, IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB, and IFN-γ, were significantly higher in pediatric TB patients compared with normal children (P < 0.05). Furthermore, miRNA-31 expression was negatively correlated with serum levels of IL-6 (t = 69.91, P < 0.001), TNF-α (t = 10.96, P < 0.001), NF-κB (t = 39.94, P < 0.001), and IFN -γ (t = 37.94, P < 0.001). The cut-off threshold of miR-31 for pediatric TB diagnosis is 0.835 with a sensitivity of 98.5% and a specificity of 86.7%. Therefore, miR-31 has the potential to be a diagnostic marker in pediatric TB patients. © FUNPEC-RP.},

abstract={Background: Effective infectious disease control requires early diagnosis and treatment initiation. Pointof-care testing offers rapid turn-around-times, facilitating same day clinical management decisions. To maximize the benefits of such POC testing programs, we need to understand how rapid tests are used in everyday clinical practice. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey study, 400 primary healthcare providers in two cities in South Africa were interviewed on their use of rapid tests in general, and tuberculosis diagnostic practices, between September 2012 and June 2013. Public healthcare facilities were selected using probability-sampling techniques and private healthcare providers were randomly selected from the Health Professional Council of South Africa list. To ascertain differences between the two healthcare sectors 2-sample z-tests were used to compare sample proportions. Results: The numbers of providers interviewed were equally distributed between the public (n = 200) and private sector (n = 200). The most frequently reported tests in the private sector include blood pressure (99.5%), glucose finger prick (89.5%) and urine dipstick (38.5%); and in the public sector were pregnancy (100%), urine dipstick (100%), blood pressure (100%), glucose finger prick (99%) and HIV rapid test (98%). The majority of TB testing occurs in the public sector, where significantly more providers prefer Xpert MTB/RIF assay, the designated clinical TB diagnostic tool by the national TB program, as compared to the private sector (87% versus 71%, p-value >0.0001). Challenges with regard to TB diagnosis included the long laboratory turn-around-time, difficulty in obtaining sputum samples and lost results. All providers indicated that a new POC test for TB should be rapid and cheap, have good sensitivity and specificity, ease of sample acquisition, detect drug-resistance and work in HIV-infected persons. Conclusion/significance: The existing centralized laboratory services, poor quality assurance, and lack of staff capacity deter the use of more rapid tests at POC. Further research into the practices and choices of these providers is necessary to aid the development of new POC tests. © 2015 Davids et al.

abstract={Background: There is an urgent need for a simple and accurate test for the diagnosis of human Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the infectious agent causing tuberculosis (TB). Here we describe a serological test based on light emitting recombinant proteins for the diagnosis of pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Methods: Luciferase Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS), a fluid-phase immunoassay, was used to examine antibody responses against a panel of 24 different M. tuberculosis proteins. Three different strategies were used for generating the constructs expressing the recombinant fusion M. tuberculosis proteins with luciferase: synthetic gene synthesis, Gateway recombination cloning, and custom PCR synthesis. A pilot cohort of African pulmonary TB patients was used for initial antibody screening and confirmatory studies with selected antigens were performed with a cohort from Thailand and healthy US blood donors. In addition to testing M. tuberculosis antigens separately, a mixture that tested seven antigens simultaneously was evaluated for diagnostic performance. Results: LIPS testing of a pilot set of serum samples from African pulmonary TB patients identified a potential subset of diagnostically useful M. tuberculosis antigens. Evaluation of a second independent cohort from Thailand validated highly significant antibody responses against seven antigens (PstS1, Rv0831c, FbpA, EspB, bfrB, HspX and ssb), which often showed robust antibody levels up to 50- to 1000-fold higher than local community controls. Marked heterogeneity of antibody responses was observed in the patients and the combined results demonstrated 73.5 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for detection of pulmonary TB. A LIPS test simultaneously employing the seven M. tuberculosis antigen as a mixture matched the combined diagnostic performance of the separate tests, but showed an even higher diagnostic sensitivity (90 %) when a cut-off based on healthy US blood donors was used. Conclusion: A LIPS immunoassay employing multiple M. tuberculosis antigens shows promise for the rapid and quantitative serological detection of pulmonary TB. © 2015 Burbelo et al.},

abstract={Disseminated Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a leading cause of bloodstream infection and severe sepsis in sub-Saharan African settings with a high burden of tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Despite the high prevalence of M. tuberculosis bacteremia in these settings it is underrecognized. This is in part because timely diagnosis of M. tuberculosis bacteremia is difficult using traditional TB diagnostics. Novel triage algorithms and rapid diagnostic tests are needed to expedite the identification and treatment of patients with severe sepsis due to M. tuberculosis bacteremia. In this article, we emphasize the importance of M. tuberculosis bacteremia as an under-recognized etiology of severe sepsis, and discuss the potential role of two emerging rapid diagnostic tests in the triage and prognostication of critically ill patients with advanced HIV infection and suspected disseminated M. tuberculosis. We conclude with the recommendation that clinicians in high TB-HIV burden settings strongly consider empiric anti-tuberculosis treatment in patients with advanced HIV infection and severe sepsis in the appropriate clinical context. Future studies are needed to assess diagnostic and prognostic algorithms for severe sepsis caused by disseminated M. tuberculosis in these settings, and the safety, efficacy, and duration of empiric anti-tuberculosis treatment. © 2015 The Union.},

abstract={Background The PD-1 axis is a cell intrinsic immunoregulatory pathway that mediates T cell exhaustion in chronic infection particularly in some viral infections. We hypothesized that PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 would be highly expressed in untreated tuberculosis patients compared to controls due to their chronic infection and would decrease with successful TB treatment. Materials and Methods Untreated tuberculosis patients (n = 26) were recruited at diagnosis and followed up during treatment. Household contacts (n = 24) were recruited to establish baseline differences. Blood gene expression ex vivo was investigated using qRT-PCR. Flow cytometry was performed to establish protein expression patterns. Results PD-L1 gene expression was found to be elevated in active TB disease; however, this was not observed for PD-1 or PD-L2. The intensive phase of TB treatment was associated with a significant decline in PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 gene expression. PD-1 protein expression on the surface of NK cells, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was similar in patients with active TB disease compared to controls but declined with successful TB treatment, with the greatest decline occurring on the NK cells followed by CD8+ T cells and then CD4+ T cells. Granzyme B/PD-1 co-expression declined with successful intensive phase treatment. Conclusion Modulation of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway through TB treatment indicates changes in the peripheral T cell response caused by live Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) followed by the response to dead bacilli, antigen-release and immuno-pathology resolution.

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis is an important zoonotic disease transmitted by direct contact, respiratory pathway, ingestion of unpasteurised milk and milk product, raw or undercooked meat. Tuberculosis can be difficult to diagnose based only on the clinical signs. Tuberculosis is usually diagnosed in the field with the tuberculin skin test. Sputum and other body fluids may be collected for microbiological examination. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have also been described. Diagnostic blood tests include the lymphocyte proliferation assay, the interferon gamma (IFN-γ) assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). In this study a total of 50 animals were tested by using tuberculin skin test (TST), lateral flow rapid test, IFN-γ assay and real time PCR. The animals were selected randomly among 178 cattle in dairy farms with the aged between 3-5 years and suspected of having tuberculosis. Forty five cattle were positive out of 50 for TST while 31 for reactive by the IFN-γ assay and 28 for rapid test and 9 for real time PCR. The purpose behind such variable as age was to compare sensitivity of tuberculin skin test, the IFN-γ assay and TB lateral flow rapid test and real time PCR examination for the diagnosis of field outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis in Turkey. © 2015 Veteriner Fakultesi Dergisi.

abstract={Background: Autopsy studies of HIV/AIDS-related hospital deaths in sub-Saharan Africa reveal frequent failure of pre-mortem diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), which is found in 34-64 % of adult cadavers. We determined the overall prevalence and predictors of TB among consecutive unselected HIV-positive adults requiring acute hospital admission and the comparative diagnostic yield obtained by screening urine and sputum samples obtained on day 1 of admission with Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert). Methods: To determine overall TB prevalence accurately, comprehensive clinical sampling (sputum, urine, blood plus other relevant samples) was done and TB was defined by detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in any sample using Xpert and/or mycobacterial liquid culture. To evaluate a rapid screening strategy, we compared the diagnostic yield of Xpert testing sputum samples and urine samples obtained with assistance from a respiratory study nurse in the first 24 h of admission. Results: Unselected HIV-positive acute adult new medical admissions (n = 427) who were not receiving TB treatment were enrolled irrespective of clinical presentation or symptom profile. From 2,391 cultures and Xpert tests done (mean, 5.6 tests/patient) on 1,745 samples (mean, 4.1 samples/patient), TB was diagnosed in 139 patients (median CD4 cell count, 80 cells/μL). TB prevalence was very high (32.6 %; 95 % CI, 28.1-37.2 %; 139/427). However, patient symptoms and risk factors were poorly predictive for TB. Overall, ≥1 non-respiratory sample(s) tested positive in 115/139 (83 %) of all TB cases, including positive blood cultures in 41/139 (29.5 %) of TB cases. In the first 24 h of admission, sputum (spot and/or induced samples) and urine were obtainable from 37.0 % and 99.5 % of patients, respectively (P <0.001). From these, the proportions of total TB cases (n = 139) that were diagnosed by Xpert testing sputum, urine or both sputum and urine combined within the first 24 h were 39/139 (28.1 %), 89/139 (64.0 %) and 108/139 (77.7 %) cases, respectively (P <0.001). Conclusions: The very high prevalence of active TB and its non-specific presentation strongly suggest the need for routine microbiological screening for TB in all HIV-positive medical admissions in high-burden settings. The incremental diagnostic yield from Xpert testing urine was very high and this strategy might be used to rapidly screen new admissions, especially if sputum is difficult to obtain. © 2015 Lawn et al.},

abstract={Introduction: To investigate the diagnostic performance of folate receptor-positive circulating tumor cells in distinguishing non- small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from lung benign disease by using a novel ligand-targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection technique. Methods: Circulating tumor cells were enriched from 3-ml peripheral blood by immunomagnetic depletion of leukocytes and then labeled with a conjugate of a tumor-specific ligand folic acid and a synthesized oligonucleotide. After washing off free conjugates, the stripped bound conjugates were analyzed by quantitative PCR. Results: Seven hundred fifty-six participants (473 patients with NSCLC, 227 patients with lung benign disease, and 56 healthy donors) were randomly assigned to a training set and a test set. The circulating tumor cell (CTC) levels in patients with NSCLC were significant higher than those with lung benign disease (p < 0.001) and healthy donors (p < 0.001). Compared with carcinoembryonic antigen, neuron-specific enolase, and Cyfra21-1, CTCs displayed the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (training set, 0.815; validation set, 0.813) in the diagnosis of NSCLC, with a markedly sensitivity (training set, 72.46%; validation set, 76.37%) and specificity (training set, 88.65%; validation set, 82.39%). The model combining CTCs with carcinoembryonic antigen, neuronspecific enolase, and Cyfra21-1 was more effective for the diagnosis of NSCLC than tumor makers alone (sensitivity and specificity in the training set, 84.21% and 83.91%; validation set, 88.78% and 87.36%, respectively). In addition, the CTC levels were higher in patients with stage III/IV NSCLC compared with those with stage I/II disease. Conclusion: Ligand-targeted PCR technique was feasible and reliable for detecting folate receptor-positive CTCs in patients with NSCLC, and CTC levels could be used as a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of NSCLC.},

abstract={Background: Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a type of diffuse interstitial lung disease characterized by the pathology of fibroblastic plugs in the lumens of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. The occurrence of BOOP in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has rarely been described, and there have been no clinical case reports in Korea. Case presentation: A 24-year-old female who had been diagnosed with HIV ten years prior was admitted due to a 1-year history of cough and sputum production and a 3-day history of fever. She had poor adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) due to gastrointestinal troubles. At the time of admission, her CD4 T-cell count was 5 cells/mm3. A high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan showed tiny centrilobular nodules with a tree-in-bud pattern in both lungs. Bacterial culture, Pneumocystis jirovecii polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (Ag) assay, and respiratory virus PCR were negative. Rapid chest x-ray improvement was seen after a 7-day treatment with anti-tuberculosis medication, ceftriaxone, and clarithromycin. Miliary tuberculosis seemed unlikely considering the rapid radiologic improvement and negative tuberculosis PCR results. Due to the unknown etiology, we performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to determine the cause of the diffuse lung infiltration. Pathologic findings were consistent with BOOP, while tissue acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain and tuberculosis PCR results were negative. Tuberculosis medication and intravenous ceftriaxone were discontinued, while treatment with clarithromycin monotherapy was sustained. Five months after discharge, the patient was asymptomatic with a normal chest x-ray and as her adherence to ART improved, her CD4 T-cell count rose to 181 cells/mm3. Clarithromycin was discontinued at that time and the patient is currently receiving regular outpatient follow-up. Conclusion: This case suggests that macrolides are a potential treatment option in HIV-infected patients with mild BOOP. In cases that are otherwise unexplained or unresponsive to treatment, BOOP should be taken into consideration and surgical biopsy performed to confirm a diagnosis of BOOP. © 2015 Jung et al.},

abstract={Abstract Summary The goal of this study was to identify a host gene signature that can distinguish tuberculosis (TB) from other pulmonary diseases (OPD). We conducted real-time PCR on whole blood samples from patients in Brazil. TB and OPD patients (asthma and non-TB pneumonia) differentially expressed granzyme A (GZMA), guanylate binding protein 5 (GBP5) and Fc gamma receptor 1A (CD64). Receiver operating characteristic, tree classification and random forest analyses were applied to evaluate the discriminatory power of the three genes and find the gene panel most predictive of patients' disease classification. Tree classification produced a model based on GBP5 and CD64 expression. In random forest analysis, the combination of the three genes provided a robust biosignature to distinguish TB from OPD with 95% specificity and 93% sensitivity. Our results suggest that GBP5 and CD64 in tandem may be the most predictive combination. However, GZMA contribution to the prediction model requires further investigation. Regardless, these three genes show promise as a rapid diagnostic marker separating TB from OPD. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Background HIV-1 and Plasmodium falciparum malaria cause substantial morbidity in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially as co-infecting pathogens. We examined the relationship between presence of P. falciparum DNA in plasma samples and clinical malaria as well as the impact of atazanavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI), on P. falciparum PCR positivity. Methods ACTG study A5175 compared two NNRTI-based regimens and one PI-based anti-retroviral (ARV) regimen in antiretroviral therapy naïve participants. We performed nested PCR on plasma samples for the P. falciparum 18s rRNA gene to detect the presence of malaria DNA in 215 of the 221 participants enrolled in Blantyre and Lilongwe, Malawi. We also studied the closest sample preceding the first malaria diagnosis from 102 persons with clinical malaria and randomly selected follow up samples from 88 persons without clinical malaria. Results PCR positivity was observed in 18 (8%) baseline samples and was not significantly associated with age, sex, screening CD4+ T-cell count, baseline HIV-1 RNA level or co-trimoxazole use within the first 8 weeks. Neither baseline PCR positivity (p = 0.45) nor PCR positivity after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (p = 1.0) were significantly associated with subsequent clinical malaria. Randomization to the PI versus NNRTI ARV regimens was not significantly associated with either PCR positivity (p = 0.5) or clinical malaria (p = 0.609). Clinical malaria was associated with a history of tuberculosis (p = 0.006) and a lower BMI (p = 0.004). Conclusion P. falciparum DNA was detected in 8% of participants at baseline, but was not significantly associated with subsequent development of clinical malaria.

abstract={To study the various modes of presentation, diagnosis, and management of surgical emergencies of tubercular abdomen. This prospective study of surgical emergencies of tubercular abdomen was conducted in 50 patients who attended our surgical emergency from 2006 to 2008. Patients were evaluated thoroughly with history, physical examination, routine investigations, and special investigations such as ELISA, PCR, barium studies of gastrointestinal tract, and diagnostic laparoscopy as required and managed with medical and surgical treatment as necessary. The most of patients were from rural areas, in the third to sixth decades with slight male preponderance. Abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation were commonest presenting symptoms. About 20 % patients had history of pulmonary tuberculosis and 16 % patients presented with ascites. PCR for blood and ascitic fluid was positive in 72 and 87.5 % patients, respectively. About 24 % patients were managed nonoperatively and responded to ATT. About 76 % patients needed surgery among which one-fifth of patients were operated in emergency. Procedures like adhesiolysis of gut (47.3 %), strictureplasty (10.5 %), resection anastomosis (5.2 %), right hemicolectomy (5.2 %), and ileotransverse anastomosis (7.8 %) were performed in 30 patients and peritoneal biopsy and lymph node biopsy in the remaining 8 patients. Both medically and surgically managed patients were put on antitubercular therapy. Abdominal tuberculosis is a disease of middle-aged rural people, presenting commonly with abdominal pain and vomiting with right lower abdominal tenderness. PCR (blood and ascites) for tuberculosis is much more sensitive than IgM ELISA (blood and ascites). The most of patients required surgical procedures and all patients responded dramatically to antitubercular therapy symptomatically with increase in the hemoglobin level and decrease in ESR. © 2012, Association of Surgeons of India.},

abstract={The new immunodiagnostic tests based on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific antigen, early secretory antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10), showed promising results in the diagnosis of tuberculosis infection. However, there are only few studies in the published literature on performance tests in cerebrospinal fluid. We investigated whether a rapid diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) could be established by interferon-γ blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests in children. We used the QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube test (QFT-IT) on blood and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT-G) on the CSF of 63 subjects with TBM (including 25 case of definite TBM and 38 cases of probable TBM) and 62 controls. The CSF analyses indicated possible TBM in 63.4% of cases. The sensitivity of the CSF culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was only 39.6%. The sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test (TST) was 49.2% and the specificity was 88.6%. The estimated sensitivities of the QFT-G for the CSF and QFT-IT for the blood in culture confirmed TBM cases (gold standard) were 84% and 80%, respectively. The estimated specificities were 98.2% for the CSF and 87.9% for the blood. This study showed that the sensitivity of QFT for the CSF could be higher than TST and culture and slightly higher in CSF than in blood. The specificity of QFT-G for the CSF was higher those of the TST, but the specificity of QFT-IT is lower. QFT-G of the CSF is a useful diagnostic marker of tuberculosis that may improve the management of TBM, but the test results must be correlated with clinical, radiological and characteristics of CSF. New researches are needed to investigate the performance of QFT-G in the CSF compared with ELISPOT and PCR. © 2015, University of Medicine and Pharmacy Targu Mures. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The development of simple, accurate, rapid and cost-effective technologies for mutation detection is crucial to the early diagnosis and prevention of numerous genetic diseases, pharmacogenetics, and drug resistance. Proofreading PCR (PR-PCR) was developed for mutation detection in 1998 but is rarely applied due to its low efficiency in allele discrimination. Here we developed a modified PR-PCR method using a ddNTP-blocked primer and a mixture of DNA polymerases with and without the 3′-5′ proofreading function. The ddNTP-blocked primer exhibited the best blocking efficiency to avoid nonspecific primer extension while the mixture of a tiny amount of high-fidelity DNA polymerase with a routine amount of Taq DNA polymerase provided the best discrimination and amplification effects. The modified PR-PCR method is quite capable of detecting various mutation types, including point mutations and insertions/deletions (indels), and allows discrimination amplification when the mismatch is located within the last eight nucleotides from the 3′-end of the ddNTP-blocked primer. The modified PR-PCR has a sensitivity of 1-5 × 102 copies and a selectivity of 5 × 10-5 mutant among 107 copies of wild-type DNA. It showed a 100% accuracy rate in the detection of P72R germ-line mutation in the TP53 gene among 60 clinical blood samples, and a high potential to detect rifampin-resistant mutations at low frequency in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using an adaptor and a fusion-blocked primer. These results suggest that the modified PR-PCR technique is effective in detection of various mutations or polymorphisms as a simple, sensitive and promising approach. © 2015 Hao et al.},

abstract={Objectives: A recently developed RD-1 gene-based assay for diagnosing tuberculous peritonitis (TBP) has given promising results. We therefore created a clinical algorithm for differentiating TBP from other diagnoses using peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid mononuclear cells (PBMC/PF-MC) along with conventional tests. Methods: All adult patients with suspected TBP in whom enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays were performed both on PBMC and PF-MC were prospectively enrolled over a 6-year period. Confirmed TBP with positive cultures or Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR, probable TBP with PF changes consistent with TBP, caseating granuloma, and a successful response to anti-TB therapy, as well as possible TBP without exclusion of TBP, were each defined. Results: A total of 74 patients were enrolled. Of these, 45 (61%) (19 confirmed, 16 probable, and 10 possible) were classified as TBP. The other 29 (39%) patients were classified as not TB. The sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of the tested methods for diagnosing TBP were as follows: PBMC ELISPOT (≥6 spots), 84% and 59%; PF-MC ELISPOT (≥6 spots), 87% and 86%; PF-MC/PBMC ratio (≥3), 69% and 97%; and PF-ADA level (≥21U/L), 82% and 79%. The areas under the ROC curves were as follows: PF-MC ELISPOT, 0.90; PF-MC/PBMC ratio, 0.82; PBMC ELISPOT, 0.80; and PF-ADA, 0.80, respectively. When a 2-step algorithm ('PBMC ELISPOT ≥6 spots or PF-ADA ≥21U/L' as a rule-out test and 'PF-MC/PBMC ratio ≥3' as a rule-in test) was applied, 67% (30/45) of the patients with TBP were accurately classified without undergoing invasive procedures. Conclusions: A 2-step algorithm using the PBMC/PF-MC ELISPOT assays and PF-ADA appears to be a promising rapid and non-invasive approach for diagnosing TBP. © 2014 The British Infection Association.},

abstract={Early detection and effective treatment are crucial for tuberculosis control, but global case detection rates remain low. The diagnosis of paediatric and extrapulmonary disease is problematic and there are, as yet, no rapid screening tests to assist active case finding in the community. Progress has been made in clinic-based detection tools with the introduction of Xpert MTB/RIF, a nucleic acid amplification test that combines sample processing and analysis in a single instrument to provide a diagnostic result and detection of resistance to rifampicin in under 2. h. Enthusiasm for Xpert MTB/RIF has been high and global rollout has been facilitated by donor agencies. However, concerns remain about access and sustainability due to the high cost and infrastructure requirements. Although more sensitive than smear microscopy, early studies suggest the impact of the new test on case detection rates and patient survival has been limited. Alternative technologies are being developed, including non-sputum-based tests to assist the detection of extrapulmonary disease. Evaluation studies are needed to provide evidence of the impact of the new technologies on patient outcomes. This will enable appropriate placement of new diagnostic products in the healthcare system to support the control and eventual eradication of tuberculosis disease. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Blood stream tuberculosis (TB), caused by (MTB) is common among HIV-positive patients, turning rapidly fatal unless detected and treated promptly. Blood culture is currently the standard test for the detection of MTB in whole blood but results take weeks; patients deteriorate markedly and often die before a diagnosis of blood stream TB is made. Rapid molecular tests on whole blood, with potential for same day diagnosis of blood stream TB usually show low sensitivity due to the problem of insufficient MTB DNA template when extraction is performed directly on low blood volumes. This study assessed the influence of blood volume on the sensitivity of a HyBeacon PCR assay-the FluoroType ® MTB (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) on direct detection of MTB in whole blood. Methods: Prospective recruitment of HIV-positive patients with clinical suspicion of blood stream TB but not on anti-TB or HIV drug treatment was done. Venous blood samples were collected and DNA extracted using the MolYsis (Molzym, Bremen, Germany) methods; for study A, from duplicate 1 ml ( 42 patients) and for study B ( 31 patients) from 9 ml EDTA blood samples. The FluoroType ® MTB PCR assay targeting an IS 6110 sequence was performed and results compared with blood culture. Results: The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the FluoroType ® MTB PCR in study A was 33% and 97%, respectively. Corresponding values in study B were 71% and 96%, respectively. In both studies, one case each of blood culture-negative blood stream TB was detected with the FluoroType ® MTB PCR assay. The median time to positivity of blood culture was 20.1 (range 12 - 32 ) for study A and 19.9 days (range 15 - 30 ) for study B. Conclusion: Larger blood volumes ( 9 ml) improved and gave acceptable sensitivity of direct PCR diagnosis of blood stream TB. © Bwanga et al.},

abstract={The present study was aimed at evaluating the role of a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay in the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and comparison of its performance with the in-house conventional PCR (C-PCR) assay. A RT-PCR assay using SYBR green methodology and C-PCR targeting a segment of the gene for mycobacterial IS6110 region were evaluated in 109 clinical samples consisting of 59 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and 50 sputum samples for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). When compared with the findings of clinical observations, the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR in detecting TBM was 87.5 and 88.5%, respectively and that of C-PCR assay was 79.1 and 88.5%, respectively in the same set of CSF samples. For detecting PTB, sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR was 91.7 and 84.6% and C-PCR assays was 77 and 92.8%, respectively in sputum samples. The overall accuracy of the RT-PCR assay was higher compared with that of the C-PCR assay. Additionally, the RT-PCR has the advantage of a short experimental time, low risk of sample contamination, and offers the possibility to quantify bacterial load, making it a powerful tool for the rapid diagnosis of TBM and PTB.},

abstract={Tuberculosis still represents a big global public health challenge. The diagnosis of tuberculosis and the differentiation between active and latent tuberculosis remain difficult, particularly in childhood, because of the lack of a gold standard test for diagnosis. In the last decade, novel diagnostic assays have been developed. Among immunologic tests, new assays based on the measurement of different cytokines released by specific T cells in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, other than INF-γ, have been investigated. Promising results rely on nucleic acid amplification techniques, also able to detect drugs resistance.

abstract={Background: Granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis (GIN) is common due to infections, drugs or sarcoidosis. However, the cause is often difficult to establish and the studies are limited. We studied the etiology of GIN and compared the clinical and histological features and outcome in different etiologies at a tertiary care center in North India. Methods: Renaö biopsies fromGIN cases diagnosed fromJanuary 2004 to April 2014were retrieved. Stain for acid fast bacilliwas performed in all biopsies. Etiological diagnosis was based on clinical features, extra-renal manifestations, radiology, history of drug intake and demonstration of infective agent. Tissue PCR for tubercular DNA was performed in seven biopsies. Results: Seventeen GIN patients [mean age 35 ± 15 years; males 11] were identified. Tuberculosis was the commonest etiology followed by idiopathic, sarcoidosis and fungal. Both tuberculosis and sarcoidosis patients presented with subnephrotic proteinuria and raised serum creatinine. Acid fast bacilli were demonstrated in 1/9 and necrosis was demonstrated in 3/9 granulomas in tuberculosis. Tissue PCR for tubercular DNA was positive in six TB patients and negative in one sarcoidosis patient. Patients responded well to appropriate therapy. Conclusion: Etiological diagnosis of GIN is essential for timelyand appropriate therapy. Tuberculosis is the commonest etiology (53%) in the tropics. Necrosis in granuloma, demonstration of acid fast bacilli, blood interferon gamma release assay and urine culture is not sensitive for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in GIN. Our findings suggest that tissue PCR for tuberculosis performed in an appropriate clinical setting is useful in the diagnostic evaluation of GIN. © The Author 2015.

abstract={Background: Prompt and accurate diagnosis of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is highly challenging. Current conventional techniques lack sensitivity and are time-consuming. Here, we report our experience with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) using two targets namely IS6110 and protein antigen b in the diagnosis of extra-pulmonary TB. Materials and Methods: A total of 150 patients of extra-pulmonary TB visiting tertiary care center in north India between September 2008 and December 2009 were included in the study. Sixty-six biopsy samples and 84 were body fluids from these patients were subjected for microscopy (Ziehl-Neelsen), culture on LJ medium and for Multiplex PCR using IS6110 and Protein b antigen. Results: Smear positivity was noted in 11 samples (7.33%), and LJ culture yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 8 biopsies and 9 body fluids with overall positivity of 11.3%. The multi-targeted PCR could detect M. tuberculosis in a total of 112 samples. Of 112 positive samples, only Protein b band was detected in 7 samples and only IS6110 was detected in 5 samples. Overall Protein b, PCR could detect 71.33% of the cases, whereas IS6110 was positive in 66.6% of the cases. Overall the sensitivities of microscopy, culture, IS6110 PCR, Protein b PCR and MPCR were 7.33%, 11.3%, 66.67%, 71.3% and 74.6%, respectively. Thus by using more than two targets the sensitivity increased from 66.67% of IS6110 to 74.6% in MPCR. Conclusion: Multiplex polymerase chain reaction using IS6110 and Protein b antigen is a highly sensitive and specific tool in the diagnosis of pauci-bacillary conditions like extra-pulmonary TB.},

abstract={Background: With the development of assisted reproductive technology, more patients with infertility prefer to get pregnant by in vitro fertilization and embryo transplantation (IVF-ET). But the indications of IVF-ET must be strictly controlled by the clinicians. Case report: We described a case of a 29-year-old pregnant Chinese woman with military tuberculosis. She was admitted to the hospital with complaints of fever and shortness of breath. She received IVF-ET 83 days ago, because of infertility with bilateraltubal occlusion, and was in pregnancy status. We presented the clinical, laboratory and two chest CT scan features of the patient. The second chest CT scan showed randomly distributed, innumerable tiny, military nodules throughout the lungs. The fluorescence quantitative PCR of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The M. tuberculosis was cultured from BALF on Day 29. So we made the diagnosis of military tuberculosis. Conclusion: It is important to rule out tuberculosis for the infertility patients especially with bilateraltubal occlusion before IVF-ET in order to avoid tuberculosis disseminate during pregnancy. © 2015 Makerere University, Medical School.

abstract={Interferon (IFN)-γ release assays have limited sensitivity and cannot differentiate between active tuberculosis (TB) disease and latent TB infection (LTBI). Numerous cytokines and regulator factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Additional cytokines and chemokines associated with M. tuberculosis infection may improve the performance of IFN-γ release assays. We developed a real-time RT-PCR TaqMan assay for targeting levels of eight human targets [IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and evaluated the assay with three different study groups. Results showed that the sensitivity of TNF-α, IL-2R, and CXCL10 in the active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group was 96.43%, 96.43%, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of IL-2R and CXCL10 in the latent tuberculosis infection group was 86.36% and 81.82%, respectively. Statistical results showed that TNF-α and CXCL9 were the best individual markers for differentiating between the PTB, LTBI, and non-TB groups. For optimal sensitivity and differentiation of M. tuberculosis infection status, the simultaneous detection of multiple targets was attempted. The combination of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2R, and the combination of TNF-α, IL-2R, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed the best performance for detecting active PTB (both 100% positivity) and LTBI (86.36% and 81.82% positivity, respectively). These results imply that the combination of suitable markers is useful in efficiently diagnosing TB and differentiating M. tuberculosis infection status. © 2015 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the Association for Molecular Pathology.

abstract={Purpose. To review the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis of the sternoclavicular joint in 13 patients. Methods. Records of 9 men and 4 women aged 26 to 47 (mean, 36.5) years who presented with tuberculosis of the right (n=8) or left (n=5) sternoclavicular joint were reviewed. Results. All 13 patients had a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate at presentation. Nine patients presented with systemic symptoms including malaise, fever, or loss of weight/appetite. Local symptoms included cold abscess (n=5), tenderness and non-fluctuant swelling (n=4), and discharging sinus (n=4). The mean duration of symptoms was 2.7 (range, 1–7) months. Four patients had multifocal involvement of the proximal ulna (n=1), lung (n=2), and meninges (n=1). Aspiration (n=3), fine needle aspiration cytology (n=4), drainage (n=2), or curettage (n=4) of the swelling, abscess, or sinus was performed, and the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology (n=8), polymerase chain reaction (n=5), or culture (n=1). Two patients were diagnosed based on clinical suspicion. 11 patients responded to antituberculous therapy (ATT), and symptoms resolved after 6 to 8 weeks. Two patients did not respond to ATT after 3 months and were screened for immunocompromising disorders or drug resistance. Their CD4 count and CD4:CD8 ratio was low, and an immunomodulation regimen was prescribed as an adjunct to ATT. Conclusion. A high level of clinical suspicion is needed to diagnose tuberculosis of the sternoclavicular joint in patients with pain/tenderness, discharging sinus, or cold abscess. A combination of histopathological and microbiological tests, and PCR can confirm the diagnosis. © 2015, Hong Kong University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Neuroinfections are serious diseases. They are associated with frequent development of permanent, debilitating consequences or even death. The aim of this work was to determine potentially preventable agents by vaccinations in patients who were hospitalized in the years 2004-2013 at the Department of Infectious Diseases of the University Hospital Ostrava. The prospective study included 1463 patients, of which 283 patients had purulent meningitis and 1,180 patients had aseptic meningitis. The criterion for the diagnosis was the number of elements in cerebrospinal fluid over 5x106/l. The diagnosis of purulent meningitis was established by cultivation cerebrospinal fluid and blood culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. The diagnosis of aseptic meningitis was established by serological tests for tick-borne encephalitis, enterovirus, mumps, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Lyme disease. PCR was used to investigate enterovirus, influenza virus, and herpes viruses. Among the 283 patients with purulent meningitis, potentially preventable agents were detected in 124 cases (44%), of which 70 cases it was Streptococcus pneumoniae, in 51 cases Neisseria meningitidis, in 7 cases Haemophilus influenzae type b and in 1 case Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among the 1,180 patients with aseptic meningitis potentially preventable agents were detected in 257 cases (22%). Tick-borne encephalitis in 186 cases, 54 cases of varicella zoster virus infection, 14 cases of mumps and 3 cases of flu. From the results we can state that vaccination is an important prevention of neuroinfections and it is desirable to increase immunization coverage especially of risk populations. © 2015, Medakta s.r.o.

abstract={Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is characterised by heavy proteinuria, hypoproteinaemia and oedema presenting in the first 3 months of life. We present a 27-day-old female patient admitted to the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital with CNS; one of twins and HIV exposed but uninfected. The child had a cytomegalovirus (CMV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive result in the urine, confirmed on two separate occasions. The CMV PCR for qualitative testing of CMV DNA was negative and quantitative testing was not done. CMV retinitis and central nervous system involvement were absent. Despite treatment with gancyclovir, the CNS did not improve. Further management required indomethacin followed by unilateral nephrectomy to decrease administration of albumin infusions to control oedema. Unfortunately, due to loss to follow-up, the patient demised from probable sepsis. We discuss the challenges we faced with respect to the diagnosis and management of CNS in a resource-limited setting where transplantation is not readily available. © 2015, Health and Medical Publishing Group.

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common zoonotic disease, caused by Mycobacterium bovis (M. Bovis), responsible for significant economic losses worldwide. Its diagnosis is based on the detection of cell mediated immunity under the exposure to protein purified derivative tuberculin (PPD), a complex and poorly characterized reagent. The cross-reactivity to non-tuberculous mycobacterium species (false-positive results) has been crucial to develop a more proper antigen. In the present study, we selected six M. Bovis Open Reading Frames (Mb1992, Mb2031c, Mb2319, Mb2843c, Mb2845c and Mb3212c) by in-silico analysis and evaluated them in experimental and natural infection; none of these antigens had been previously assessed as diagnostic antigens for bTB. The reactivity performance was tested in animals with both positive and negative Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) results as well as in cattle infected with Mycobacterium avium subesp. paratuberculosis (MAP). The six recombinant antigens individually induced an IFN-γ response, with overall responder frequency ranging from 18.3 to 31%. Mb2845c was the most valuable antigen with the potential to discriminate TST-positive cattle from either TST-negative or MAP infected animals. Mb2845c showed similar performance to that observed with ESAT-6 and PPD-B among TST and MTC specific-PCR positive animals, although this result needs to be proven in further studies with a higher sample size. Our data confirm the feacibility to implement bioinformatic screening tools and suggest Mb2845c as a potential diagnostic antigen to be tested in protein cocktails to evaluate their contribution to bTB diagnosis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={IFN-gamma releasing assays (IGRAs) such as T-SPOT.TB assay and QuantiFERON-TB In-Tube (QFT-GIT) have yielded promising results for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). However, little is known about the usefulness of these assays for diagnosing disseminated TB. We therefore compared their usefulness with traditional tests in patients with disseminated TB. All adult patients with suspected disseminated TB were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary hospital in an intermediate TB-burden country during a 6-year period. Disseminated TB was defined as involvement of the bone marrow or ≥2 noncontiguous organs, or presence of miliary lung lesions. A total of 101 patients with confirmed and probable disseminated TB were finally analyzed. Of these 101 patients, 52 (52%) had miliary TB and the remaining 49 (48%) had nonmiliary disseminated TB. In addition, 63 (62%) had no underlying disease. Chronic granuloma with/without necrosis, acid-fast bacillus staining, Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR, and culture for M tuberculosis were positive in 77% (41/53), 43% (43/101), 70% (67/96), and 72% (73/101), of the patients, respectively. The T-SPOT.TB assay was positive in 90% (91/101) of them. The sensitivity of the TSPOT. TB assay in patients with miliary TB (90%) was similar to that in patients with nonmiliary TB (90%) (P> 0.99). In a subgroup analysis of the 58 patients in whom both QFT-GIT and the T-SPOT.TB results were available, the sensitivity of QFT-GIT (67%) was lower than that of T-SPOT.TB (95%) (P<0.001). In conclusion, T-SPOT.TB assay may be a helpful adjunct test for disseminated TB. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem. Routine laboratory tests or newly developed molecular detection are limited to the quality of sputum sample. Here we selected genes specific to TB by a minimum redundancy-maximum relevancy package using publicly available microarray data and determine level of selected genes in blood collected from a Thai TB cohort of 40 active TB patients, 38 healthy controls and 18 previous TB patients using quantitative real-time PCR. FCGR1A, FCGR1B variant 1, FCGR1B variant 2, APOL1, GBP5, PSTPIP2, STAT1, KCNJ15, MAFB and KAZN had significantly higher expression level in active TB individuals as compared with healthy controls and previous TB cases (P<0.01). A mathematical method was applied to calculate TB predictive score, which contains the level of expression of seven genes and this score can identify active TB cases with 82.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity as compared with conventional culture confirmation. In addition, TB predictive scores in active TB patients were reduced to normal after completion of standard short-course therapy, which was mostly in concordant with the disease outcome. These finding suggested that blood gene expression measurement and TB Sick Score could have potential value in terms of diagnosis of TB and anti-TB treatment monitoring. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={Introduction Liver hilar tuberculous lymphadenitis is extremely rare. A case of liver hilar tuberculous lymphadenitis mimicking lymph node metastasis of anal canal cancer that was successfully diagnosed by laparoscopic lymph node biopsy is reported. Presentation of case A 49-year-old man with a past medical history of pulmonary tuberculosis suffering from anal canal cancer with left inguinal lymph node metastasis underwent laparoscopic anterior perineal resection and left inguinal lymph node dissection in February 2010. Subsequently, he underwent dissection of right inguinal lymph node metastases from anal canal cancer twice in February and October 2013. In July 2014, follow-up computed tomography (CT) showed a 26 mm × 23 mm lesion with calcification on the anterior side of the portal vein in the hepatoduodenal ligament. He had no jaundice. Positron emission tomography with 2[18 F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG-PET) revealed a mass with high uptake. Suspecting a lymph node metastasis from anal canal cancer, laparoscopic lymph node biopsy was performed. Histopathological and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examinations yielded a diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis. No evidence of recurrence of cancer has been seen during the 5 years of follow-up after the surgery for anal canal cancer. Discussion FDG-PET imaging is rarely useful for differentiating cancer from tuberculosis lesions. Laparoscopic lymph node biopsy is a safe, effective alternative to open surgical biopsy. Conclusion Tuberculous lymphadenitis should be included among the differential diagnoses of liver hilar lymphadenopathy in patients with a history of tuberculous. Laparoscopic lymph node biopsy is useful for the diagnosis of undiagnosed lymphadenopathy. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Visceral leishmaniasis is an infection with an insidious and disabling course caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania. In Europe, it is mostly associated with HIV infection. Systemic lupus erythematosus and its treatment are associated with increased risk of infection, neoplastic and concomitant autoimmune disorders. The association of these diseases may go unnoticed. A 60 year-old Caucasian woman with lupus presented with a one-year history of fever, malaise, weakness and weight loss. The highlights on physical examination were pallor, palpable hepatosple-nomegaly and low-grade fever. Blood tests showed pancytopenia, hyperproteinemia with hypoalbu-minemia and hypergammaglobulinemia; electrophoresis showed a polyclonal gamma curve. Full-body CT scan revealed massive hepatosplenomegaly. Microbiology investigation was negative for the most common pathogens, including tuberculosis. There were no signs of hematologic malignancy in the bone marrow smear. PCR for Leishmania infantum was positive both in blood and bone marrow. The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin B, and immunosuppression was adjusted. She showed rapid clinical improvement and 6 months later had no signs of disease. The differential diagnosis in a patient with lupus presenting with fever and multisystemic manifestations includes infectious or neoplastic disorders. The patient lived in an endemic area of Leishmania, and typical clinical and analytical changes were all present, making this case highly educational. The case highlights the importance of a patient's epidemiological background and how it can lead to the diagnosis and timely treatment of a rare disease. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Background Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in HIV-positive individuals, causing 1.1 million incident cases and 0.32 million deaths in 2012. Diagnosis of TB is particularly challenging in HIV-coinfected individuals, due to a high frequency of smear-negative disease, atypical presentations, and extrapulmonary TB. Objective The aim of this article was to review the current literature on molecular diagnostics for TB with an emphasis on the performance of these diagnostic tests in the HIV-positive population. Methods We searched the PubMed database using at least one of the terms TB, HIV, diagnostics, Xpert MTB/RIF, nucleic acid amplification tests, drug susceptibility testing, RNA transcription, and drew on World Health Organization publications. Findings With increased focus on reducing TB prevalence worldwide, a new set of tools for diagnosing the disease have emerged. Molecular tools such as Xpert MTB/RIF and line-probe assays are now in use or are being rolled out in many regions. The diagnostic performance of these and other molecular assays are discussed here as they pertain to the HIV-positive population. Conclusions Molecular diagnostics offer a useful addition and at times, alternative, to traditional culture methods for the diagnosis of TB. However, most of these tests suffer from decreased accuracy in the HIV-positive population. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={The present study analysed the concordance among four different molecular diagnostic methods for tuberculosis (TB) in pulmonary and blood samples from immunocompromised patients. A total of 165 blood and 194 sputum samples were collected from 181 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with upper respiratory complaints, regardless of suspicious for TB. The samples were submitted for smear microscopy, culture and molecular tests: a laboratory-developed conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the Gen-Probe and Detect-TB Ampligenix kits. The samples were handled blindly by all the technicians involved, from sample processing to results analysis. For sputum, the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 96.7% for qPCR, 81.8% and 94.5% for Gen-Probe and 100% and 66.3% for Detect-TB, respectively. qPCR presented the best concordance with sputum culture [kappa (k) = 0.864)], followed by Gen-Probe (k = 0.682). For blood samples, qPCR showed 100% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity, with a substantial correlation with sputum culture (k = 0.754) and with the qPCR results obtained from sputum of the corresponding patient (k = 0.630). Conventional PCR demonstrated the worst results for sputa and blood, with a sensitivity of 100% vs. 88.9% and a specificity of 46.3% vs. 32%, respectively.

abstract={Background: Detection of the mycobacterial cell wall antigen lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in urine can be used to diagnose HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB) using a qualitative (positive/negative) read-out. However, it is not known whether the quantity of LAM present in urine provides additional prognostic information. Methods/Findings: Consecutively recruited adult outpatients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa were investigated for TB regardless of clinical symptoms using sputum smear microscopy and liquid culture (reference standard). Urine samples were tested using the Clearview TB-ELISA for LAM and the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The ELISA optical densities (OD) were used as a quantitative assessment of urine LAM. Among 514 patients with complete sputum and urine LAM OD results, culture-confirmed TB was diagnosed in 84 patients. Twenty-three (27.3%) were LAM-positive with a median LAM OD of 0.68 (IQR 0.16-2.43; range, 0.10-3.29) and 61 (72.6%) were LAM negative (LAM OD <0.1 above background). Higher LAM ODs were associated with a range of prognostic indices, including lower CD4 cell counts, lower haemoglobin levels, higher blood neutrophil counts and higher mycobacterial load as assessed using both sputum and urine samples. The median LAM OD among patients who died was more than 6.8-fold higher than that of patients who remained alive at 3 months (P<0.001). The small number of deaths, however, precluded adequate assessment of mortality risk stratified according to urine LAM OD. Conclusions: In patients with HIV-associated TB, concentrations of LAM in urine were strongly associated with a range of poor prognostic characteristics known to be associated with mortality risk. Urine LAM assays with a semi-quantitative (negative vs. low-positive vs. high-positive) read-out may have improved clinical utility over assays with a simple binary result. © 2014 Kerkhoff et al.},

abstract={Introduction: Currently only limited data exist regarding the availability and clinical use of molecular and immunological tests for tuberculosis (TB) in the European setting. Methods: Web-based survey of Paediatric-Tuberculosis- Network-European-Trialsgroup (ptbnet) and Tuberculosis-Network-European- Trialsgroup (TBnet) members conducted June to December 2013. Both networks comprise clinicians, microbiologists, epidemiologists and researchers predominately based in Europe. Results: 191 healthcare professionals from 31 European countries participated. Overall, 26.8% of respondents did not have access to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay; only 44.6% had access to the assay in-house. However, a substantial proportion had access to other commercial and/or non-commercial PCR-based assays for TB (68.8% and 31.8%, respectively). Only 6.4% did not have access to any PCR-based assays for TB. A large proportion of participants with access to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay had used it for the analysis of non-respiratory samples [pleural fluid: 36.5%, gastric aspirates: 34.7%, cerebrospinal fluid: 34.7%, stool samples: 4.3%, blood/serum: 2.6%, 'other samples' (which included biopsy/tissue samples, lymph node aspirates, joint aspirates and urine samples): 16.5%]. Regarding interferon-gamma release assays, a greater proportion of respondents had access to the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay (84.7%) than to the T-SPOT.TB assay (52.2%). Conclusions: Both immunological and molecular TB tests are widely available across Europe. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay is more widely used than the T-SPOT.TB assay, which may reflect the difficulties of integrating an ELISPOT assay into the routine laboratory setting. Although Xpert MTB/RIF assays are optimised and solely licensed for the analysis of sputum samples, in clinical practice they are commonly used for non-respiratory samples. Further research is needed to establish how current molecular TB tests impact on patient care and outcome in the routine clinical setting. © 2014 Tebruegge et al.},

abstract={Osteoarticular infections remain a significant cause of morbidity worldwide in young children. They can have a devastating impact with a high rate of serious and long-lasting sequelae, especially on remaining growth. Depending on the localisation of infection, they manifest as osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, a combination of both (i.e., osteomyelitis with adjacent septic arthritis) or spondylodiscitis. Osteoarticular infections can be divided into three types according to the source of infection: haematogenous; secondary to contiguous infection; or secondary to direct inoculation. During the last few years, many principles regarding diagnostic assays and the microbiological causes of these infections have evolved in a significant manner. In the present current-opinion review, we discuss recent concepts regarding epidemiology, physiopathology, and the microbiology of bone and joint infections in young children, as well as clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of these infections. Clinicians caring for children need to be especially well versed in these newer concepts as they can be used to guide evaluation and treatment.},

abstract={Objective: To explore the level of soluble programmed death ligand 1 (sPD-L1) in pleural effusion and peripheral blood of patients with tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) and elucidate its clinical implications. Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed pleural effusion at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from June 2012 to March 2013 were enrolled and divided into 3 groups of TPE, malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and non-tuberculous non-malignant pleural effusion (non-TPE non-MPE) according to the nature of pleural effusion. The level of sPD-L1 in pleural effusion and peripheral blood was analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Flow cytometry was used to detect the changes of immune cell subsets in pleural effusion. And the gene expressions of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) were detected in different effusions by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: A total of 77 newly diagnosed patients with pleural effusion were enrolled, 24 patients with TPE, 39 patients with MPE, 14 patients with non-TPE non-MPE. The level of sPD-L1 in TPE was higher than that in MPE and non-TPE non-MPE (4.2 (2.6-6.3), 1.4 (0.8-2.1), 1.8 (1.2-2.6) μg/L, P &lt; 0.001). No significant difference existed in the levels of sPD-L1 in peripheral blood samples (P=0.811). The average content of sPD-L1 in pleural effusion in all patients was statistically higher than that in peripheral blood (2.0 (1.4-3.7), 1.5 (1.0-2.0) μg/L, P=0.004). The proportion of CD8 subset, PD-L1 on CD14+ monocytes and the mRNA level of PD-L1, MMP-3 in TPE were higher than in MPE and non-TPE non-MPE (P =0.001, P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001), and the mRNA level of PD-L1 in TPE was positively correlated with the level of MMP-3 (r = 0.887, P &lt; 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that sPD-L1 had a sensitivity of 82.6%, a specificity of 83.8% and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.854 for differential diagnosis of TPE from other conditions. Combinations of sPD-L1, PD-L1 on CD14+ monocytes and adenosine deaminase (ADA) measurements further increased the sensitivity up to 91.3%, specificity up to 89.2% and AUC up to 0.989. Conclusion: The elevated expression of sPD-L1 in tuberculous pleural effusion may aid the diagnosis of TPE. Copyright © 2014 by the Chinese Medical Association.},

abstract={Background: Renal transplant recipients are at high risk of developing multiple infections, often concomitantly because of their immunocompromised status. Post renal transplant infections are often elusive and require extensive evaluation for proper diagnosis and treatment. A high index of suspicion is required and an attempt should be made to confirm the microbiological diagnosis from each site involved to rule out multiple infections.Case presentation: We report a 50-year-old female, a renal allograft recipient who presented with left hemiplegia, esophageal ulcers and fever 3 months after her transplant. Esophageal biopsy revealed Cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclusions and the whole blood quantitative CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive. Neuroimaging showed a brain abscess, stereotactic biopsy from which revealed Scedosporium apiospermum on fungal culture. Her tacrolimus and mycophenolate were stopped and she was managed with intravenous ganciclovir and voriconazole. With these measures, she showed marked improvement in her general and neurological condition. Two months later, she developed recurrence of fever with dry cough. Radiological investigation revealed a cavitating lung lesion, a needle aspiration from which demonstrated acid-fast bacilli. She was started on antituberculous treatment. With these measures, she recovered completely and maintained good graft function despite being on only prednisolone 10 mg once a day.Conclusion: Although CMV disease is not uncommon in the first three months post transplant, Scedosporium is a rare cause of brain abscess. On the other hand, tuberculosis is common in transplant recipients, especially in developing countries, like India. However, this is the first case report of occurrence of these three infections in the same patient, demonstrating the importance of a good microbiological work-up from each site involved in immunosuppressed subjects. © 2014 Rathi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: The relationship between anemia and undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) in patients living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa is incompletely defined. We assessed the prevalence of TB among those with HIV-related anemia and evaluated new means of rapid TB diagnosis. METHODS: Blood hemoglobin levels were measured in unselected antiretroviral treatment-naive patients in Cape Town, South Africa, and anemia was classified according to World Health Organization criteria. All patients were screened for TB by testing paired sputum samples using liquid culture (reference standard), fluorescence microscopy, and Xpert MTB/RIF. Urine samples were tested for lipoarabinomannan (LAM) using the Determine TB-LAM diagnostic assay. RESULTS: Of 602 adults screened, 485 had complete results. Normal hemoglobin levels were found in 44.5% (n = 216) of patients, and mild, moderate, or severe anemia were present in 24.9% (n = 121), 25.4% (n = 123) and 5.2% (n = 25) of patients, respectively. Culture-confirmed pulmonary TB was diagnosed in 8.8% (19/216) of those without anemia compared with 16.5% (20/121), 26.0% (32/123), and 40.0% (10/25) among those with mild, moderate, or severe anemia, respectively (P < 0.001). Anemia was a strong independent predictor of TB. The sensitivities of diagnostic assays were much higher among those with moderate/severe anemia compared with those with no/mild anemia using sputum microscopy (42.9% vs 15.4%), urine LAM (54.8% vs 0%), sputum microscopy plus urine LAM (71.4% vs 15.4%), and sputum Xpert (73.8% vs 41.0%) (P < 0.01 for all). CONCLUSIONS: A very high prevalence of undiagnosed TB was found in patients with moderate or severe anemia. Such patients should be prioritized for routine microbiological investigation using rapid diagnostic assays. © 2013 by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.},

abstract={Background: Severe malnutrition is a risk factor for pneumonia due to a wide range of pathogens but aetiological data are limited and the role of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is uncertain. Methods: We prospectively investigated severely malnourished young children (<5 years) with radiological pneumonia admitted over a 15-month period. Investigations included blood culture, sputa for microscopy and mycobacterial culture. Xpert MTB/RIF assay was introduced during the study. Study children were followed for 12 weeks following their discharge from the hospital. Results: 405 eligible children were enrolled, with a median age of 10 months. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from blood culture in 18 (4.4%) children, of which 72% were Gram negatives. Tuberculosis was confirmed microbiologically in 7% (27/ 396) of children that provided sputum - 10 by culture, 21 by Xpert MTB/RIF assay, and 4 by both tests. The diagnostic yield from induced sputum was 6% compared to 3.5% from gastric aspirate. Sixty (16%) additional children had tuberculosis diagnosed clinically that was not microbiologically confirmed. Most confirmed tuberculosis cases did not have a positive contact history or positive tuberculin test. The sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF assay compared to culture was 67% (95% CI: 24-94) and 92% (95% CI: 87-95) respectively. Overall case-fatality rate was 17% and half of the deaths occurred in home following discharge from the hospital. Conclusion and Significance: TB was common in severely malnourished Bangladeshi children with pneumonia. X-pert MTB/RIF assay provided higher case detection rate compared to sputum microscopy and culture. The high mortality among the study children underscores the need for further research aimed at improved case detection and management for better outcomes. © 2014 Chisti et al.},

abstract={Background: Complement functions as an important host defense system and complement C5 and C7 have been implicated in immunopathology of tuberculosis. However, little is known about the role of other complement components in tuberculosis. Methods: Complement gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of tuberculosis patients and controls were determined using whole genome transcriptional microarray assays. The mRNA and protein levels of three C1q components, C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC, were further validated by qRT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The percentages of C1q expression in CD14 positive cells were determined by flow cytometry. Finally, C1qC protein level was quantified in the pleural fluid of tuberculosis and non-tuberculosis pleurisy. Results: C1q expression increases significantly in the peripheral blood of patients with active tuberculosis compared to healthy controls and individuals with latent TB infection. The percentage of C1q-expressing CD14 positive cells is significantly increased in active TB patients. C1q expression in the peripheral blood correlates with sputum smear positivity in tuberculosis patients and is reduced after anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. Notably, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that C1qC mRNA levels in peripheral blood efficiently discriminate active from latent tuberculosis infection and healthy controls. Additionally, C1qC protein level in pleural effusion shows improved power in discriminating tuberculosis from non-tuberculosis pleurisy when compared to other inflammatory markers, such as IL-6 and TNF-α. Conclusions: C1q expression correlates with active disease in human tuberculosis. C1q could be a potential diagnostic marker to discriminate active tuberculosis from latent tuberculosis infection as well as tuberculosis pleurisy from non-tuberculosis pleurisy. © 2014 Cai et al.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant human health issue. More effective biomarkers for use in tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, including markers that can discriminate between healthy individuals and those with latent infection, are urgently needed. To identify a set of such markers, we used Solexa sequencing to examine microRNA expression in the serum of patients with active disease, healthy individuals with latent TB, and those with or without prior BCG inoculation. We identified 24 microRNAs that are up-regulated (2.85-1285.93 fold) and 6 microRNAs that are downregulated (0.003-0.11 fold) (P<0.05) in patients with active TB relative to the three groups of healthy controls. In addition, 75 microRNAs were up-regulated (2.05-2454.58 fold) and 11 were down-regulated (0.001-0.42 fold) (P<0.05) in latent-TB infected individuals relative to BCG- inoculated individuals. Of interest, 134 microRNAs were differentially-expressed in BCG-inoculated relative to un-inoculated individuals (18 up-regulated 2.9-499.29 fold, 116 down-regulated 0.0002-0.5 fold), providing insights into the effects of BCG inoculation at the microRNA level. Target prediction of differentially-expressed microRNAs by microRNA-Gene Network analysis and analysis of pathways affected suggest that regulation of the host immune system by microRNAs is likely to be one of the main factors in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. qRT-PCR validation indicated that hsa-miR-196b and hsa-miR-376c have potential as markers for active TB disease. The microRNA differentialexpression profiles generated in this study provide a good foundation for the development of markers for TB diagnosis, and for investigations on the role of microRNAs in BCG-inoculated and latent-infected individuals. © 2014 Zhang et al.},

abstract={Background and Aims: The morbidity of ulcerative colitis (UC) is increasing in China every year. In addition, there is a lack of accurate diagnostic indices with which to evaluate the activity of the disease. The aim of this study was to identify UC-associated proteins as biomarkers for the diagnosis, and objective assessment of disease activity. Methods: Differential expression of serum proteins from UC patients compared to normal controls was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The expression of heat shock factor 2(HSF2)in colonic mucosa in Crohn's disease, Behcet's disease, ulcerative colitis, intestinal tuberculosis, infective enteritis, intestinal lymphoma, and normal controls was investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of the HSF2 in colonic mucosa of UC subjects with varying severity of disease was measured by real time-PCR and Western Blots. The expression of HSF2 was inhibited by HSF2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection in Caco-2 cells. The concentrations of HSF2, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serum and IL-1β, and TNF-α in the supernatants of transfected Caco-2 cells were determined by ELISA. Results: HSF2 was differentially expressed in UC patients compared to normal controls. HSF2 expression was significantly higher in the intestinal mucosa of UC patients compared to other six groups. The results of immunohistochemistry, real time-PCR, Western Blots, and ELISA showed that the expression of HSF2 increased in parallel with the severity of UC. The serum concentration of HSF2 also positively correlated with levels of IL-1β and TNF-α. After down-regulation expression of HSF2 in Caco-2 cells by RNA interference, the productions of IL-1β and TNF-α stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased dramatically. Conclusions: HSF2 appears to be a potential novel molecular marker for UC activity, and may provide a basis for studies on the pathogenesis and novel therapeutic targets for UC. © 2014 Miao et al.},

abstract={The study was aimed for molecular detection of mycobacterial DNA in different clinical samples using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system and rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. A total of 508 clinical specimens (blood 343, menstrual fluid 53, endometrial tissue 43, body fluid 36, pus from lymph nodes 18, sputum 8, urine 5 and semen 2) were included in this study. We extracted DNA using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and performed real-time assay using Rotor-Gene Q machine from Corbett Research, Australia for specific amplification of IS6110 sequence of mycobacterial genome. The RT-PCR result was also compared with bacterial culture and acid-fast bacillus staining. RT-PCR assay showed positivity in 52 cases and negative in 456 cases. Corresponding positive results in culture and acid-fast bacillus staining methods were 49 cases and 24 cases respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis by RT-PCR were 93.87% and 98.69% respectively taking positive culture results as reference standards. The overall positive and negative predictive values were 88.46% and 99.34% respectively. RT-PCR is a useful diagnostic tool for rapid and sensitive detection of mycobacteria in different clinical samples. The easy processing, fast reporting and relative lack of contamination issues make it worthy as a possible replacement to time consuming culture techniques. Moreover, it has added advantage of quantification of mycobacterial DNA, hence bacterial load.},

abstract={Objectives: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is more sensitive, specific, and rapid than the conventional methods of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture. The aim of this study was to determine if the Xpert MTB/rifampicin (RIF) assay had additional advantages over nested PCR for the detection of MTB in a geographical area with intermediate tuberculosis (TB) incidence. Methods: Between February and December 2013, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR, as well as AFB smear and culture, were simultaneously performed on 198 clinical samples (160 pulmonary and 38 non-pulmonary specimens) collected from 171 patients hospitalized at Hallym University Medical Center for possible TB. The accuracy of the diagnosis of MTB culture-positive TB and the turnaround time of reporting laboratory results were calculated and compared. Rifampin resistance by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay was reviewed with that of conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). Results: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR for diagnosis of MTB culture-positive pulmonary TB were 86.1% vs. 69.4% (P=0.1563), 97.8% vs. 94.1% (P=0.2173), 91.2% vs. 75.8% (P=0.1695), and 96.4% vs. 92.0% (P=0.2032), respectively. The median turnaround times of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR were 0 [0-4] days and 4 [1-11] days, respectively (P < 0.001). Two cases of rifampin resistance, as determined by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, were found to be multi-drug resistant (MDR) pulmonary TB by DST. Conclusions: The Xpert MTB/RIF assay seemed to be sensitive, specific, and comparable to nested PCR for identifying MTB among clinically suspected TB patients, and the assay can be valuable in giving a timely identification of resistance to rifampin. © Pioneer Bioscience Publishing Company.},

abstract={Background: Xpert MTB/RIF ('Xpert') and urinary lipoarabinomannan (LAM) assays offer rapid tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, but have suboptimal sensitivity when used individually in HIV-positive patients. The yield of these tests used in combination for the diagnosis of active TB among HIV-infected TB suspects is unknown. Design: Study of comparative diagnostic accuracy nested into a prospective study of HIV-infected individuals with signs and/or symptoms of TB in Uganda. Methods: Xpert testing of archived sputum was conducted for culture-confirmed TB cases and TB suspects in whom a diagnosis of TB was excluded. Additional testing included sputum smear microscopy, sputum culture (solid and liquid media), mycobacterial blood culture, and urinary testing for LAM using a lateral flow test ('LF-LAM') and an enzyme-linked immunosorbance assay ('ELISA-LAM'). Results: Among 103 participants with culture-confirmed TB, sensitivity of Xpert was 76% (95% confidence interval, CI 0.66-0.84), and was superior to that of LF-LAM (49%, 95% CI 0.39-0.59, P<0.001). Specificity was greater than 97% for both tests among 105 individuals without TB. The combination of smear microscopy and LF-LAM identified 67% (95% CI 0.57-0.76) of culture-confirmed TB cases and approached sensitivity of Xpert testing alone (P=0.15). The sensitivity of the combination of Xpert and LF-LAM was 85% (88/103 95% CI 0.77-0.92), which was superior to either test alone (P<0.05) and approached sensitivity of sputum liquid culture testing (94%, 95% CI 0.88-0.98, P=0.17). Conclusion: Sputum Xpert and urinary LAM assays were complementary for the diagnosis of active TB in HIV-infected patients, and sensitivity of the combination of these tests was superior to that of either test alone. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={South Africa implemented Xpert MTB/RIF as the initial diagnostic test for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Xpert MTB/RIF's accuracy for diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) was investigated. EPTB specimens (n7,916) from hospitalized patients received over a 6-month period at a high-throughput TB referral laboratory in Johannesburg were investigated. Largevolume specimens were centrifuged, tissue biopsy specimens homogenized, and all specimens checked for growth of contaminating bacteria on blood agar. Contaminated samples received NALC-NaOH (N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide) decontamination prior to liquid culture. Residual specimens (volumes>1 ml) after inoculation of culture (n1,175) were tested using the Xpert MTB/RIF sputum protocol. Using culture as the reference, Xpert MTB/RIF's overall sensitivity was 59% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 53% to 65%) and specificity was 92% (CI, 90% to 94%), with the highest sensitivities of 91% (95% CI, 78% to 97%) for pus, 80% (95% CI, 56% to 94%) for lymph node aspirates, and 51% (95% CI, 44% to 58%) for fluids (ascitic, 59%; pleural, 47%). A difference in sensitivities was noticed between specimens classified as having a thick (87% [95% CI, 76% to 94%]) versus clear (watery) (48% [95% CI, 36% to 61%]) appearance. This was unchanged with traces of blood (52% [95% CI, 44% to 60%]) or precentrifugation (57% [95% CI, 28% to 82%]) among clear specimens. Xpert MTB/RIF generated an additional 124 specimen results that were contaminated by Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tubes (MGIT; 10.5%) and diagnosed rifampin (RIF) resistance earlier (9.6% [25/260]). Xpert MTB/RIF's performance on EPTB specimens provides very promising results and should be considered for incorporation into national TB guidelines. Xpert MTB/RIF is less affected by contaminating bacteria and reduces laboratory labor and diagnostic delay compared to traditional methods. © 2014 American Society for Microbiology.

abstract={BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection is a global health problem. Failure to accurately identify cases of active MTB has serious effects on both patients and the community. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear has poor sensitivity and culture methods have a delay ranging from 1 to 8 weeks for diagnosis. Nucleic acid amplification assays may be suitable candidates for this purpose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, we evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in 190 patients with pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis whom were admitted to Tehran Imam Khomeini hospitals during 2006-2010. Three ml citrated blood samples were obtained from cases. DNA extraction was performed by QIAGEN commercial kit and PCR performed with IS1081 Primer. RESULTS: Fifty six cases had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and 134 were pulmonary. Overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 41.1% and 95.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MTB-PCR assay on PBMC using IS1081 primer has a low sensitivity and now can not use as a single or alternative diagnostic test for tuberculosis. However, with regard to its high specificity can use for help diagnosing of TB in cases have no enough sputum (or other specimens) to examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Improved diagnostic tests for tuberculosis in children are needed. We hypothesized that transcriptional signatures of host blood could be used to distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in African children who either were or were not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHODS: The study population comprised prospective cohorts of children who were undergoing evaluation for suspected tuberculosis in South Africa (655 children), Malawi (701 children), and Kenya (1599 children). Patients were assigned to groups according to whether the diagnosis was culture-confirmed tuberculosis, culture-negative tuberculosis, diseases other than tuberculosis, or latent tuberculosis infection. Diagnostic signatures distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases and from latent tuberculosis infection were identified from genomewide analysis of RNA expression in host blood. RESULTS: We identified a 51-transcript signature distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases in the South African and Malawian children (the discovery cohort). In the Kenyan children (the validation cohort), a risk score based on the signature for tuberculosis and for diseases other than tuberculosis showed a sensitivity of 82.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.6 to 94.3) and a specificity of 83.6% (95% CI, 74.6 to 92.7) for the diagnosis of culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Among patients with cultures negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis who were treated for tuberculosis (those with highly probable, probable, or possible cases of tuberculosis), the estimated sensitivity was 62.5 to 82.3%, 42.1 to 80.8%, and 35.3 to 79.6%, respectively, for different estimates of actual tuberculosis in the groups. In comparison, the sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for molecular detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in cases of culture-confirmed tuberculosis was 54.3% (95% CI, 37.1 to 68.6), and the sensitivity in highly probable, probable, or possible cases was an estimated 25.0 to 35.7%, 5.3 to 13.3%, and 0%, respectively; the specificity of the assay was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: RNA expression signatures provided data that helped distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in African children with and those without HIV infection.

abstract={Diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis (E-TB) remains a challenge because clinical samples obtained from sites that are not easily accessible are sometimes paucibacillary, decreasing the sensitivity of diagnostic tests. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is widely used for adjunct diagnosis of E-TB with extrasanguinous fluid. However, ADA is not a specific marker for E-TB, so a more specific test is urgently needed for the confirmation of E-TB. Recently, an IFN-gamma releasing assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells and extrasanguinous fluid mononuclear cells, and the newly-developed Xpert MTB/RFP have shown promising results for the rapid diagnosis of E-TB. Although the regimen of antituberculous medication for E-TB is similar to that for pulmonary tuberculosis, the treatment of E-TB is occasionally complicated due to a paradoxical response during antituberculous therapy and after the completion of antituberculous therapy, especially in tuberculous lymphadenopathy. The proposed algorithm for the management of paradoxical response in tuberculous lymphadenopathy is presented, and the treatment for E-TB in various sites is briefly reviewed. © 2014 Korean Medical Association.},

abstract={The diagnostic usefulness of Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN)-stained sputum smears combined with conventional polymerase chain reaction (ZN/PCR) to amplify IS6110 region DNA extracted from ZN slides was evaluated. The objective was to verify if this association could improve tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in patients at remote sites. The study was carried out in 89 patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB as defined by the Brazilian Manual for TB Treatment. The participants were recruited in a reference unit for TB treatment in Rondônia, a state in the Amazonian area in northern Brazil. ZN, PCR, and culture performed in the sputum samples from these patients were analyzed in different combinations (i.e., ZN plus PCR and ZN plus culture). The prevalence rates of pulmonary TB in these patients were 32.6 and 28.1% considering culture and ZN/PCR, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of ZN/PCR were 86 and 93%, respectively. ZN/PCR was able to detect more TB cases than ZN alone. This method could offer a new approach for accurate tuberculosis diagnosis, especially in remote regions of the world where culture is not available. © 2014, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica.

abstract={Background: Culture and specific staining (including Zeil-Nelson and fluorescent methods) are standard measures for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). These methods are time-consuming and sometimes have a low level of accuracy. In addition, in some cases obtaining samples for smear and culture involves invasive procedures; while in other cases there is no suitable sample for evaluation. Therefore, there is a need for faster and more accurate diagnostic methods. Objectives: The current study investigated the diagnostic value of tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (TB-PCR) of urine in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Patients and Methods: This case-control study included; 77 proven pulmonary tuberculosis cases (according to the national TB protocol), and 30 subjects who were completely healthy. The urine samples (50 mL) were mixed with 0.5 mL Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid. DNA extraction and PCR testing were performed on all blood samples using SI 6110 primers. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also cultivated in the sputum and urine samples of the patients. Results: Results of the current study indicated that 48 (62.3%) patients out of 77 had a positive sputum culture. Urine cultures and acid-fast smears were negative. Urine PCR-TB was positive in 48.0% (37/77) of the patients. The specific TBPCR complex was positive in 56.2% (27/48) of the positive cultures and 34.4% (10/29) of the negative culture PTB patients. The control group had negative urine PCR (sensitivity 56.2% and specificity 100%). Conclusions: With regard to the ease of urine sample preparation and the 100% specificity the PCR method, performing urine PCR could be used as a diagnostic aid in PTB cases obtaining sputum samples is problematic. © 2014, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences; Published by Kowsar Corp.},

Methods: A total of 44 consecutive serum specimens were collected from clinically suspected OTB patients, based on clinical and radiological [X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography] features. They were screened by in-house nested PCR. In addition, a few specimens were examined by Gram stain, acid-fast bacilli stain, histopathology and routine bacterial culture. A total of 39 specimens were collected from patients suffering from other bone diseases of nontuberculous origin and included as negative controls. Results: Of the 44 clinically suspected OTB patients, in-house nested PCR was positive in 40 (91%) cases; PCR was negative in 38 (97%) negative controls. Sensitivity and specificity of our in-house nested PCR was 90.9% and 97.4%, respectively. The PCR report was available within 48 h. It was possible to standardize serum PCR technique and in positive cases, a good correlation was observed in terms of an adequate treatment response. Conclusions: Nested PCR in serum samples is a rapid, highly sensitive and specific modality for OTB detection. PCR should be performed in addition to clinical evaluation, imaging studies, acid-fast bacilli staining, culture and histopathology diagnosis, if possible. © 2014 by the Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine.},

abstract={Objective: To clone, express, and characterize Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) ClpP2, and evaluated the potential usage of ClpP2 in clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis. Methods: Mtb ClpP2 was cloned into recombinant plasmid pET32a (+) and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the expression of the recombinant protein. The immunogenicity of Mtb ClpP2 was assessed with epitope prediction and antibody titer assay. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the influence of stress conditions on ClpP2 expression. ClpP2 antigen and antibody in patients with pulmonary diseases were detected by indirect ELISA. ROC curve was constructed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Mtb ClpP2 for tuberculosis. Results: We had cloned and expressed recombinant Mtb ClpP2 in E. coli. Our results showed that Mtb ClpP2 had potent immunogenicity, and our own prepared polyclonal antibody could be used in detection and diagnostic tests. Results from Western blot showed that ClpP2 was mainly located in M. bovis BCG cytoplasm, and real-time PCR indicated that stress conditions could enhance the mRNA expression of ClpP2. Indirect ELISA suggested that, in tuberculosis patients, both the levels of ClpP2 antigen and antibody were increased, and the positive rates of ClpP2 were elevated. ROC curve had demonstrated satisfactory sensitivity and specificity of ClpP2-based diagnosis for tuberculosis. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Mtb ClpP2 antigens would be used as a biomarker in tuberculosis pathogenesis. These findings highlight the feasibility of the application of Mtb ClpP2 in the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.},

abstract={The reference method for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections is blood culture followed by biochemical identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolated pathogen. This process requires 48 to 72 hours. The rapid administration of the most appropriate antimicrobial treatment is crucial for the survival of septic patients; therefore, a rapid method that enables diagnosis directly from analysis of a blood sample without culture is needed. A recently developed platform that couples broad-range PCR amplification of pathogen DNA with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) has the ability to identify virtually any microorganism from direct clinical specimens. To date, two clinical evaluations of the PCR/ESI-MS technology for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections from whole blood have been published. Here we discuss them and describe recent improvements that result in an enhanced sensitivity. Other commercially available assays for the molecular diagnosis of bloodstream infections from whole blood are also reviewed. The use of highly sensitive molecular diagnostic methods in combination with conventional procedures could substantially improve the management of septic patients. © 2014 Elena Jordana-Lluch et al.},

abstract={Background: In most African and Arabic countries tuberculosis (TB) causes great economic losses in bovine species and constitutes serious zoonotic problem. As the traditional diagnostic method delay the research because of low sensitivity and specificity, a rapid method of diagnosis is of outmost importance. Aim: The study was designed to evaluate the two rapid diagnostic methods of TB in cattle, further to differentiate between infected and bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinated animals. Materials and Methods: Intradermal tuberculin test was applied to 300 cattle. Of these cattle, 15 cattle were vaccinated from cattle negative to tuberculin test with BCG. Blood samples were taken for lymphocyte separation to apply polymerase chain reaction (PCR) upon and for serum preparation for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) application, this blood collected from 65 cattle classified into three groups, viz. positive tuberculin test (35 animals), negative tuberculin test (15 animals), and vaccinated cow with BCG (15 animals). From blood samples lymphocytes were separated and the isolated lymphocytes were subjected to PCR and serum for ELISA application. Blood samples, specimens from lymph nodes and specific tissues were taken for PCR and for cultivation and isolation of Mycobacterium bovis. Results and Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that PCR can be used as rapid efficient and accurate diagnostic test in detection of ruminant TB. Moreover, cattle′s ELISA reading showed higher sensitivity in positive tuberculin animals. However, the differentiations between vaccinated and infected animals not clear by using a single antigen only.},

These infections pose a major risk to travelers to these regions as well. Methods: We developed and evaluated a multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the simultaneous detection of the three pathogens in 305 patients' buffy coat samples. Results: The assay for S. typhi and B. pseudomallei was able to detect down to 1 colony forming unit/5 μL PCR input and M. tuberculosis was detected down to 20 genome copies/5 μL PCR input. S. typhi was detected in 10 (3.3 %) individuals, B. pseudomallei in 10 individuals (3.3 %), and M. tuberculosis in 18 individuals (5.9 %). Co-infections of M. tuberculosis and B. pseudomallei were detected in three individuals and S. typhi and B. pseudomallei in two individuals.

abstract={Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a zoonotic disease transmitted from animals to human and makes significant economic impacts due to high cost of eradication programs, trade restriction and serious consequences regarding public health thereby causing human tuberculosis. Mycobacterium bovis is the main etiological agent of bTB which is an acid fast staining bacterium due to waxy substance (mycolic acid) present in its bacterial cell wall. The bacteria can be transmitted by both aerogenous and enterogenous routes. Disease causes development of miliary tubercular lesions, chronic cough, obstructions of air passages and alimentary tract or blood vessels and enlargement of lymph nodes. A spectrum of Cell-Mediated Immune responses (CMI) predominate infection, projecting the role of macrophages and T-cell populations. In advanced stage, there is increased humoral response. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) have been widely used for the detection of M. tuberculosis complex in clinical samples. Single intradermal test, short thermal test and Stormont tests are the valuable delayed type of hypersensitivity tests. Gamma interferon assay, lymphocyte proliferation assay, Enzyme Linked Immune Sorbent Assay (ELISA), multiantigen print immunoassay (MAPIA), Fluorescent Polarization Assay (FPA), immunochromatographic lateral flow test, single antigen as well as multiplex chemiluminescence assays are the various blood-based laboratory tests. Attenuated bovine-strain of tuberculosis bacterium, known as Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) is used as vaccine. The present review addresses important insights into the bovine TB, a complex and multi-species disease, the etiological agent, advances and trends in its diagnosis, vaccine development and treatment options and the public health significance of this important disease which would altogether help devising effective strategies for prevention and control of tuberculosis in cattle as well as in wildlife. © 2014 Academic Journals Inc.},

abstract={Tuberculosis remains one of the most challenging infectious diseases, which rarely manifests in the middle ear cleft exclusively. Typical symptoms of tuberculosis have become more and more confusing due to the genetic evolution of different Mycobacterium species. In the diagnosis of tuberculous otitis media (TOM), clinical suspicion plays a fundamental role, when topical and/or systemic antibiotic treatment cannot lead to improvement in ear discharge and inflammation. If there is no other reason of persisting otorrhea, microbiological sampling and culturing are the subsequent steps of diagnosis. These investigations, however, have low sensitivity; therefore a canal wall-up mastoidectomy is recommended, which includes the removal of necrotic bone and multiple histological sampling from various locations. Currently, histopathological analysis is the most robust and reliable method in the diagnosis of TOM. Tuberculin skin test, Mycobacterium-specific PCR and interferon-gamma release assay cannot distinguish between active, inactive or post-infective conditions. According to these considerations, these methods may serve as supplementary assays for the final diagnosis. Having the appropriate diagnosis after surgical intervention and laboratory analysis, medical management should be continued by anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy.

abstract={Disseminated Mycobacterium avium- intracellulare complex (MAC) infection is considered as severe complication of advanced HIV/AIDS disease. Currently available various laboratory investigations have not only limited ability to discriminate between MAC infection and tuberculosis but are also laborious and time consuming. The aim of this study was, therefore, to design a molecular-based strategy for specific detection of MAC and its differentiation from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) isolated from the blood specimens of HIV patients. A simple PCR was developed based on the amplification of 120-bp katG-N gene corresponding to the first 40 amino acids of N-terminal catalase-peroxidase (KatG) protein of Mycobacterium avium that shows only ~13% sequence homology by clustal W alignment to N-terminal region of M. tb KatG protein. This assay allowed the accurate and rapid detection of MAC bacteremia, distinguishing it from M. tb in a single PCR reaction without any need for sequencing or hybridization protocol to be performed thereafter. This study produced enough evidence that a significant proportion of Indian HIV patients have disseminated MAC bacteremia, suggesting the utility of M. avium katG-N gene PCR for early detection of MAC disease in HIV patients. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Introduction: The main goal of this study was to develop a multiparametric cell population data (CPD) model that combines information from several morphologic parameters generated by DxH800, in addition to the traditional parameters regularly reported in the CBC-diff, and to test the performance of this model in screening the general population for primary tuberculosis (TB). Methods: A total of 3741 study cases were divided into two groups, test and validation set at cut-off value of 6000 WBCs/μL. We developed multiparametric model for primary TB screening (TB hemeprint), selected CPD, and calculated parameters which could discriminate primary TB from other non-TB diseases and normal control in test set. We applied it to the validation set, which was a set of completely different samples, to test its reproducibility if applied to a routine laboratory test. Results: After screening primary TB using TB hemeprint, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 85.4%, 89.6%, 31.1%, and 99.1%, respectively, in primary TB with lower than 6000 WBCs/μL of test set (test set-L). In primary TB with higher than 6000 WBCs/μL of test set (test set-H), those values were 83.1%, 85.6%, 29.7%, and 98.6%, respectively. There were only 0.4% (2/461) and 0.6% (2/326) of normal control samples included in test set-L and -H, respectively. Diagnostic efficiencies except sensitivity in each validation set were very comparable with those in each test set. Conclusion: Tuberculosis hemeprint may allow us to screen primary TB with acceptable sensitivity and specificity using combination of TB-specific CPD and calculated parameters. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Aims: Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is a rare neoplastic disease usually occurring in the dermis or subcutis of the extremities of young adults or children. Although sporadic cases in deep soft tissue and visceral organs have been reported, we present here the first description of AFH developing in a large artery. Methods and results: Paraffin sections of the surgical specimen were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and immunohistochemistry was performed (CKAE1/AE3, EMA, CD34, p63, CD38, smooth muscle actin, and desmin). In addition, FISH and RT-PCR were applied in order to check for EWRS rearrangement. The histomorphological features, and FISH analysis revealing rearrangement of EWSR, indicated the definitive diagnosis of AFH. RT-PCR confirmed EWSR rearrangement, and detected an EWSR1-ATF1 fusion transcript. Conclusions: A thoracic location of AFH has not been reported until very recently, and shares a differential diagnosis with diverse neoplasms, including spindle cell carcinoma and low-grade sarcoma. We describe the first reported case of thoracic AFH arising in a large vessel, and highlight distinctive histological and molecular features. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Background: End-stage liver disease (ESLD) is associated with dysregulation of the immune system and increased susceptibility to infections. Although invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a growing public health problem, studies of IFI in ESLD are lacking. The aims of this study were to screen for IFI in ESLD and to assess risk factors and serum interleukin 17 (IL-17) as a marker of the cellular immune response. Methods: Both blood and ascitic fluid samples were collected from 46 patients with ESLD for fungal culture and PCR. Serum IL-17 levels were determined. Results: Seven patients had isolated IFI (four had spontaneous fungal peritonitis, two had fungemia, and one had a disseminated fungal infection) and five cases had combined fungal and bacterial infections. Spontaneous fungal peritonitis was attributed to Candida species, while fungemia was caused by Aspergillus species. Patients with IFI had higher serum IL-17 levels and increased mortality compared to patients without IFI. A history of antibiotic use (p = 0.002), higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores (p = 0.04), and hepatorenal syndrome (p = 0.006) were risk factors for IFI. Conclusions: Patients with ESLD had a low frequency of IFI; however, in patients with these infections, delayed diagnosis and treatment may contribute to a high fatality rate. Thus, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for this unusual but lethal entity, as prompt detection and appropriate treatment can improve the outcome. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Background: Infections are an important acquired cause of cerebral arteriopathy. Tuberculous (TB) meningitis leading to infectious cerebral vasculopathy is a rare cause of acute hemiparesis.
Case report: A 14-year-old male patient was examined after acute hemiparesis developing within 1 day. Neurological examination revealed total hemiplegia on the left side. Brain MRI findings showed bilateral focal T2-weighted signal hyperintensity in the subcortical and deep white matter regions. There were also areas of restricted diffusion in the right basal ganglia. Although the father had a history of pulmonary TB, the patient had not been given TB prophylaxis because of PPD negativity. At lumbar puncture, opening cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was 50 cm/H20, CSF protein 66.9 mg/dL, and glucose 54 mg/dL (concurrent blood glucose 93 mg/dL); 170 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per cubic millimeter were present in CSF. Following tests for TB, treatment was started immediately with four anti-TB drugs. TB PCR of CSF and acid-fast bacteria (AFB) staining in gastric aspirate were positive. At clinical follow-up, the patient was able to walk with support at the end of the first month.
Conclusion: Various infectious agents have been reported as causes of cerebral vasculopathy. TB, which affects a significant number of patients worldwide, should be kept in mind in terms of cerebral vascular complications. Lumbar puncture is essential in order to diagnose TB meningitis. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Background: Non traumatic osteonecrosis also known as avascular necrosis (AVN), and tuberculous arthritis (TB arthritis) most commonly present as chronic monoarticular conditions. Corticosteroid intake is known to predispose individuals to the development of these two conditions.1,2
In AVN, corticosteroid remains to be the most common cause that leads to a final common pathway of disrupting blood supply to segments of bone causing cell death.1In TB arthritis, corticosteroid renders a patient relatively immunocompromised predisposing to this extra-pulmonary infection.
The incidence of tubercular osteonecrosis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus is rare. A review of literature only showed one case report of tubercular osteonecrosis diagnosed by aspiration cytology.3Since tuberculosis (TB) is a destructive but curable disease, early diagnosis and treatment are essential.
Objective: To present a case of tubercular osteonecrosis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus treated with anti-Koch’s regimen and iloprost infusion.
Case: A 27-year old Fi l i p i no female who was diagnosed with lupus nephritis and underwent three days methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Lupus nephritis improved and was clinically inactive for two years. She developed insidious onset of intermittent pain on her left knee, associated with swelling for four months with subsequent right hip pain of one week duration. MRI of the left knee showed osteonecrosis and arthritis. Radiograph of the right hip showed osteonecrosis. She underwent arthrocentesis of the left knee and the synovial fluid tested positive for tuberculosis by PCR. We started the patient on quadruple anti-Koch’s regimen together with iloprost infusion which afforded clinical improvement.
Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a lupus patient with concomitant polyarticular osteonecrosis complicated by monoarticular tuberculous arthritis.
Medical treatment, while it may be complicated by adverse drug events, is effective in symptomatic treatment, but a multidisciplinary approach is suggested for optimal outcome. © 2014 Philippine College of Physicians. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Bronchiectasis in children is caused by infection, obstruction, congenital or acquired disorders. We present a case of a little boy in which neglected foreign body aspiration led to focal bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis, surgically cured by left inferior lobectomy. A nine-year-old boy was admitted into our clinic for chronic productive cough and persistent pulmonary crackles, which occurred approximately 4 months ago. His father had pulmonary tuberculosis, for which the little boy was tested and was found to be negative (intradermal reaction, gastric lavage). Despite the use of various antibiotics, the findings on auscultation of the chest were persistantly abnormal. History revealed foreign body aspiration (sunflower seed) six years ago, followed by lung abscess, complicated with empyema, pyopneumothorax and cardiorespiratory arrest successfully resuscitated. Physical examination showed good general status, paleness, old linear scar on the left hemithorax, productive cough, wet crackles at the left lung base. CBC, ESR, PCR, serum immunoglobulins, α1-antitripsine, sweat chloride values were normal, sputum culture was negative. Esophageal pH-metry was negative for GERD. Chest X-ray showed left basal hypertransparent area and accentuated basal interstitium. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, mucolytics, chest percussion and postural drainage were started with no clinical amelioration. CT scan showed cylindrical dilatations (bronchiectasis) in segments 9 and 10 of the left lung with interstitial fibrosis. An inferior left lobectomy was performed; and histology of the specimen confirmed bronchiectasis and fibrosis, and revealed no congenital anomalies. The patient was discharged in good general condition after 3 weeks; clinical and radiological findings after 3 months showed absence of respiratory symptoms and expansion of the left lung to the thoracic cage. In foreign body aspiration early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are important in order to prevent long-term complications. In our case, because of delayed referral and lack of early bronchoscopy, the neglected foreign body produced focal bronchiectasis and basal fibrosis that necessitated surgery.},

abstract={This report presents a case of a 52-year-old female patient hospitalized due to malabsorption syndrome, abdominal pain, and mesenteric lymphadenopathy, who was diagnosed with intestinal tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Although extra-pulmonary manifestations of TB are rare and usually associated with immunodeficiency states, this patient was immunocompetent and had no pulmonary lesions. In the histopathological evaluation of the mesenteric lymph nodes specimens obtained during exploratory laparotomy noncaseating granulomas were shown. In the differential diagnosis Crohn's disease, lymphoma, carcinoma, infectious diarrhea, and Whipple's disease were considered. Based on the positive results of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, the patient was qualified for the standard 6-month course of treatment for TB. Eight months after completing the therapy her symptoms reoccurred. Endoscopic images of the small intestine demonstrated the characteristic inflammatory lesions, from which biopsies were taken for further evaluation. The patient was diagnosed with the recurrent intestinal TB. The second course of antituberculous treatment appeared to be successful. This report illustrates numerous difficulties in the diagnostic work-up of intestinal TB and the usefulness of newer endoscopic techniques such as capsule endoscopy and enteroscopy. © 2013 Cornetis.},

abstract={The utility of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum samples has been extensively studied. However, the performance of the Xpert assay as applied to other readily accessible body fluids such as exhaled breath condensate (EBC), saliva, urine, and blood has not been established. We used the Xpert assay to test EBC, saliva, urine, and blood samples from HIV-negative, smear- and culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients for the presence of M. tuberculosis. To compare the ability of the assay to perform bacterial load measurements on sputum samples with versus without sample processing, the assay was also performed on paired direct and processed sputum samples from each patient. The Xpert assay detected M. tuberculosis in none of the 26 EBC samples (sensitivity, 0.0%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.0%, 12.9%), 10 of the 26 saliva samples (sensitivity, 38.5%; 95% CI, 22.4%, 57.5%), 1 of 26 urine samples (sensitivity, 3.8%; 95% CI, 0.7%, 18.9%), and 2 of 24 blood samples (sensitivity, 8.3%; 95% CI, 2.3%, 25.8%). For bacterial load measurements in the different types of sputum samples, the cycle thresholds of the two M. tuberculosis-positive sputum types were well correlated (Spearman correlation of 0.834). This study demonstrates that the Xpert assay should not be routinely used to detect M. tuberculosis in EBC, saliva, urine, or blood samples from HIV-negative patients suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis. As a test of bacterial load, the assay produced similar results when used to test direct versus processed sputum samples. Sputum remains the optimal sample type for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative patients with the Xpert assay. Copyright © 2013, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={Central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis, particularly tuberculous meningitis (TBM), is one of the severest forms of tuberculosis. At present, the diagnosis of CNS tuberculosis remains a complex issue because the most widely used conventional "gold standard" based on bacteriological detection methods, such as direct smear and culture identification, cannot rapidly detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.Tb) bacilli in CSF specimens with sufficient sensitivity in the acute phase of TBM. Recently, instead of the conventional "gold standard", the various molecular-based methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, has emerged as a promising new method for the diagnosis of TBM. Moreover, nested PCR assay has been reported as a key method that drastically increases the sensitivity and specificity of DNA amplification compared with conventional single-step PCR. Currently, a novel assay technique, which is internally controlled and combines the high sensitivity of nested PCR with the accurate quantification of real-time PCR, namely, Wide Range Quantitative Nested Real-time PCR (WR-QNRT-PCR) assay, has been developed. This novel assay technique is useful for the rapid diagnosis and the assessment of anti-tuberculosis treatment during clinical course of TBM. Therefore, in actual clinical practice, its wider use for diagnosis of TBM is expected in the future.},

abstract={A 4-year-old neutered female crossbred Shepherd was referred for a history of 10 days of anorexia, polyuria, polydipsia, polyadenomegaly, and diarrhea. On physical examination, the dog appeared quiet, responsive, and apyretic, with generalized and severe lymphadenomegaly. Hematologic abnormalities included neutrophilic leukocytosis with left shift, and lymphopenia. Blood smears revealed intracytoplasmic bacilli negatively stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa in neutrophils and monocytes. Lymph node smears revealed pyogranulomatous adenitis with calcified deposits and many negative-staining rod structures, both within the cytoplasm of neutrophils and macrophages, and free in the background. An acid-fast stain (Ziehl-Neelsen) confirmed the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection. The dog was euthanized for public health and ethical reasons, and the postmortem examination revealed severe and generalized granulomatous and necrotizing lymphadenitis, panniculitis, and hepatitis, and infiltration of epithelioid macrophages in the lungs, colon, and spleen. Numerous acid-fast bacilli, consistent with mycobacterial infection, were observed both in the cytoplasm of epithelioid macrophages and giant cells, and free in the background. Mycobacterium bovis was first confirmed by conventional PCR of organ extracts. Mycobacterium avium was detected in a culture of the same organs. Further PCR amplifications and sequencing revealed a coinfection with 2 different species of mycobacterium, one belonging to the Mycobacterium avium complex and the other to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. © 2013 American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology and European Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology.},

abstract={Sudden death is currently described as natural unexpected death occurring within 1h of new symptoms. A frequent cause of sudden death in adults is related to cardiovascular disease. Sudden cardiac death is defined as death due to cardiac causes, and preceded by an abrupt and unexpected loss of consciousness within one hour of the onset of acute symptoms, in an individual who may have or not known pre-existing heart disease. In the young adults, myocarditis is the major cause of sudden unexpected death. Tuberculosis (TB) is still a serious problem for public health, even in highly developed countries. In the latest World Health Organization (WHO) report, TB was responsible for 8.5-9.2 million cases and 1.2-1.5 million deaths (including deaths from TB among HIV-positive people). TB is also more common among men than women, and around 2/3 of cases are estimated to occur among people aged 15-59 years. Tuberculosis has a predilection for the pulmonary system; extrapulmonary manifestation is rare, but around 1-2% of TB patients have cardiovascular involvement (MTB). MTB can present in a miliary or nodular form, occasionally with aneurysm. The infection can reach the myocardium through the blood or the lymphatic system, or as a result of contiguity from pericardium or pulmonary cavity. In the past MTB was hardly ever diagnosed while the person was alive, but now the advancement in cardiac imaging and imaging guided biopsy techniques, lead to a more frequent antemortem diagnosis. Clinically, MTB may be asymptomatic or presenting with different manifestations including intractable ventricular arrhythmias, long QT syndrome, complete heart block and in some rare cases right atrial obstruction, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, superior vena cava obstruction, left ventricular aneurysm, aortic regurgitation and heart failure. The MTB average incidence on the total number of autopsies is < 0.3%. A systematic study relative to 13.658 autopsies reported a frequency of 0.14%. MTB represents up to 4% of all TB related deaths and the majority of TB related sudden death. Cases of sudden death from previously undiagnosed MTB have rarely been reported in the literature, and they refer frequently to male subjects. According to the clinical symptoms observed in living patients, the most probable mechanism for sudden cardiac death is cardiac arrhythmias. The autopsy diagnosis of MTB depends largely on the microscopic detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and on mycobacterial culture, but the demonstration of AFB within foci of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation is rare. In recent years, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for the detection of mycobacterial DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues has been widely demonstrated in various tissue specimens, including heart, lung, lymph nodes, and other tissues. Differential diagnosis is from other forms of granulomatous inflammations including sarcoidosis and large cell idiopatic granulomatous myocarditis. A proposal of diagnostic criteria may comprise positive TB PCR, positive bacterial culture or acid-fast bacilli isolation from myocardium, since these tests provide definitive diagnosis. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

abstract={Background: Reducing mortality from HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB) requires diagnostic tools that are rapid and have high sensitivity among patients with poor prognosis. We determined the relationship between disease severity and the sensitivity of new sputum-based and urine-based diagnostic assays. Methods: Consecutive ambulatory patients enrolling for antiretroviral treatment in South Africa were screened for TB regardless of symptoms using diagnostic assays prospectively applied to sputum (fluorescence smear microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF and liquid culture (reference standard)) and retrospectively applied to stored urine samples (Determine TB-LAM and Xpert MTB/RIF). Assay sensitivities were calculated stratified according to pre-defined indices of disease severity: CD4 count, symptom intensity, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin concentration and vital status at 90 days. Results: Sputum culture-positive TB was diagnosed in 15% (89/602) of patients screened and data from 86 patients were analyzed (median CD4 count, 131 cells/μL) including 6 (7%) who died. The sensitivity of sputum microscopy was 26.7% overall and varied relatively little with disease severity. In marked contrast, the sensitivities of urine-based and sputum-based diagnosis using Determine TB-LAM and Xpert MTB/RIF assays were substantially greater in sub-groups with poorer prognosis. Rapid diagnosis from sputum and/or urine samples was possible in >80% of patients in sub-groups with poor prognosis as defined by either CD4 counts <100 cells/μL, advanced symptoms, CRP concentrations >200 mg/L or hemoglobin <8.0 g/dl. Retrospective testing of urine samples with Determine TB-LAM correctly identified all those with TB who died. Conclusions: The sensitivities of Xpert MTB/RIF and Determine TB-LAM for HIV-associated TB were highest among HIV-infected patients with the most advanced disease and poorest prognostic characteristics. These data provide strong justification for large-scale intervention studies that assess the impact on survival of screening using these new sputum-based and urine-based diagnostic approaches. © 2013 Lawn et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={SETTING: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers great promise for the rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). However, blood TB PCR is still not standardised. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the Blacklight ®Card to standardise TB PCR in blood samples using a multiplex nested PCR method targeting insertion sequence 6110 and MPB64 sequence for use as an auxiliary tool in the diagnosis of TB. DESIGN: The study focused on the standardisation of the Blacklight Card as a new extraction tool and its evaluation using 130 blood samples randomly collected from patients with clinical symptoms of TB. RESULTS: Of 130 cases, PCR was positive in 22 samples (17%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was respectively 95.7% and 100%; the positive and negative predictive values were respectively 85.1% and 99.2%. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the Blacklight Card may be a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of disseminated and extra-pulmonary forms of TB as well as in difficult-todiagnose cases in which a diagnosis is urgently needed due to the severity of the patient's status. © 2013 The Union.},

abstract={Introduction: Mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenitis (MTL) is mostly seen in primary tuberculosis in children, uncommon observed in adults. It usually presents the toxic symptoms of tuberculosis but rarely with symptoms characteristic of esophageal compression, such as dysphagia. Such patients can easily be misdiagnosed as esophageal neoplasm and get delayed or faulty treatment. Case report: A 32-year-old man presented with dull chest pain of one month and dysphagia of five days. CRP was elevated, and a skin test was strongly positive. At upper endoscopy, a protruding lesion covered by normal mucosa was seen at 26 cm from the upper incisor. Barium swallow showed visible external compressive stricture on the middle-lower esophagus with normal mucosal pattern. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a subcarinal mass adjacent to the esophageal wall in posterior mediastinum. An endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a hypoechoic lesion suspected of esophageal stromal tumor in the fourth layer. A tissue was obtained by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), but cytopathology, bacilliculture and PCR test had no special findings. The patient required experimental antitubercular treatment and the protruding lesion shrank gradually during therapy period. Conclusions: MTL could not be ignored in the differential diagnosis of posterior mediastinal mass with dysphagia. Analyzing and evaluating test results comprehensively is the key to make correct diagnosis and timely treatment. The experimental antituberculous treatment should be used if MTL is highly suspected. © Pioneer Bioscience Publishing Company.},

abstract={Clostridium difficile was thought to be nonpathogenic until 1978, when Bartlett et al. identified C. difficile as the source of cytotoxin in the stools of patients with pseudomembranous colitis, a disorder frequently associated with antimicrobial use C. difficile is responsible for both hospital-acquired and community-acquired diarrhea. Clostridium difficile is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, disruption of the gut flora, typically by antibiotics, allows C. difficile to proliferate, thus resulting in infection C. difficileexerts its pathogenic effect mainly through the production of two exotoxins, toxin A and B. Usually, exposure to both antimicrobials andtoxin-producing C. difficile strains is necessary for the development of CDI. Host factors may be as important. CDI has a wide range of manifestations, causing a self-limited mild diarrheal illness to a fulminant life-threatening colitis. The two main risk factors for CDI are antibioticexposure and age older than 65 but other factors shouldalso be considered like the use of laxatives, proton pump inhibitors or H2 histamine as gastric protection, chemotherapy, renal failure, gastrointestinal surgery, nasogastric tube, mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospital stay. The most widely used diagnostic test for the diagnosis of CDI is the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for toxin A or toxins A and B. Other methods include:an antigen test that detects the mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) within C. difficile, used for screening, stool culture, the cytotoxicity cell assay, another highly sensitive and specific method is polymerase chain reaction( PCR), sensitivity being higher than 90% and specificity of 100%. Colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopyalso used in certain situations, abdominal X-ray is used in cases of ileus or toxic megacolon. For treatment different antibiotics are used: metronidazole, Vancomycin is recommended in severe cases, other treatment options include: Fidaxomicin, Nitazoxanide, rifaximin, Teicoplanin, tigecycline, bacitracin,andfusidic acid. Probiotics are found in fermented milk, yogurt, powders and capsules as lactobacillus, bifidobacteria and Saccharomyces boulardii. They act by inhibiting bacterial adhesion to the intestinal mucosa.There are case reports according to which the use of intravenous unspecific immunoglobulin will benefit patients in recurrence, but there is little data in the literature. While the effectiveness of immunoglobulins remains controversial, monoclonal antibodies directedagainst toxins A and B have been shown to be protective against further relapses when compared to placebo, leaving the door open for future research. Fecal transplants or fecal bacteriotherapy is very promising, with success rates greater than 90% in patients with recurrent infections. In this approach, the stool may be introduced by esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy or enema [89].In patients with fulminant infection, early surgery is important. Surgery showed a benefit compared to medical therapy, especially in patients with serum lactate >5 mmol/L and/or leukocytosis ≥50 x109/L. Cl.difficile can cause different rare cases including: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) that lead to death of a 22-year-old female university student following clindamycin treatment for coverage of a tooth extraction due to a dental abscess, the emergence of multidrug-resistant C. difficile PCR ribotype 046 may be detrimental to anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy, a case of C. difficile bacteremia in a patient who had underwent loop ileostomy is reported, mycoticaneurysm causedby C. difficile is also reported, the use of fecal transplantation as a safe and highly effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection is repoterd, Clostridium difficile Infection in Infants and Children is reported also, Clostridium difficile is reported to be the first identified autotrophic bacterial pathogen[104], and Clostridium difficile enteritis is also reported.},

abstract={Background:Malnutrition is a major risk factor for the development of tuberculosis (TB). In India, Melghat is among the tribal regions which consist of highest number of malnutrition cases. Because of the paucity of TB data from these malnourished areas there is an urgent need for the development and evaluation of improved TB diagnostic tests. In the present study, three in house developed diagnostic tests namely TB-Ag(antigen) ELISA, Adenosine deaminase (ADA) estimation and IS6110 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay were investigated for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb.) infection.Methods:For investigation, blood samples were collected from 128 study subjects from six villages of Melghat tribal area and evaluated using three in house developed assays, namely TB-Ag ELISA, ADA estimation and IS6110 PCR.Results:The TB-Ag ELISA method yielded 83% sensitivity and 94% specificity. The ADA and PCR assay gave a sensitivity of 61% and 49% and specificity of 62% and 98% respectively. A considerable good agreement of 82.81% (k=0.472) between TB-Ag ELISA and PCR was observed. The overall sensitivity of TB-Ag ELISA was significantly higher (p<0.05) than the ADA and PCR while PCR yielded highest specificity among all the three evaluated tests.Conclusions:We concluded that the routine use of TB-Ag ELISA can be useful for screening of suspected TB patients in the malnourished population where sophisticated laboratory set up is difficult. © 2013 Kashyap et al.},

abstract={Introduction: This study evaluated the performance of an in-house nested-PCR system for the detection of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in pleural fluid, blood and urine samples from pleural effusion tuberculosis patients by health services physicians in Pernambuco, Brazil. Methods: A prospective double-blind study with 37 hospitalized patients of both sexes, aged over 15, was used to investigate the diagnosis of pleural effusion. The criteria used to define the cases included the demonstration of bacillus in biological samples by smear or culture or by a granulomatous finding in the histopathological examination, associated with an evident response to specific treatments to each clinical situation. Pleural fluid, blood and urine samples were collected and subjected to routine tests and the nested PCR technique to assess for M. tuberculosis amplification. Results: In total, 37 pleural effusion patients took part in the study, of whom 19 (51.3%) had tubercular etiologies and 18 (48.7%) had etiologies from other causes. When the pleural fluid, blood and/or urine sample in-house nested-PCR sensitivities were evaluated simultaneously, the results were positive regardless of the biological specimen (the sensitivity was 84.2%); however, when the blood and/or urine samples were analyzed together, the sensitivity was 72.2%. When the pleural fluid samples were evaluated alone, the sensitivity was only 33.3%. Conclusions: The performance of the diagnostic pleural tuberculosis nested-PCR was directly related to the diversity of the samples collected from the same patient. Additionally, this study may identify a need to prioritize non-invasive blood and urine collection for this diagnosis.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of invasive and non-invasive tests for diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in a large series of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. In this delayedtype cross-sectional study, 113 HIV-infected symptomatic patients were evaluated by an adjudication committee after clinical follow-up to establish the presence or absence of VL as the target condition (reference test). The index tests were recombinant K39 antigen-based immunochromatographic test (rK39), indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), prototype kit of direct agglutination test (DAT-LPC), and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in peripheral blood. Compared with parasitological test and adjudication committee diagnosis or latent class model analyses, IFAT and rk39 dipstick test presented the lowest sensitivity. DAT-LPC exhibited good overall performance, and there was no statistical difference between DAT-LPC and qPCR diagnosis accuracy. Real-time PCR emerges as a less invasive alternative to parasitological examination for confirmation of cases not identified by DAT.

abstract={The infection status of cattle for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) was determined by real-time PCR, comparing the levels of IFN-? mRNA in blood cultures stimulated with either bovine or avian tuberculin with non-stimulated control (phosphate buffer saline, PBS) blood culture. Totally, 137 cattle were tested to validate the assay, in which 54 were IFN-? real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) positive, while the remaining 83 were found negative. Meanwhile, the IFN-? ELISA test was carried out using the Bovigam IFN-? detection ELISA kit and these results were used as a standard. The results of the single intradermal tuberculin tests (SIDT) and IFN-? RT-qPCR tests were compared and revealed that the RT-qPCR correlated better with the ELISA and its accuracy was higher than SIDT. This indicates the RT-qPCR is a useful diagnostic method for bTB in cattle. However, several limitations remain for our approach, such as lack of a TB lesions or postmortem test results as a gold standard. Further improvements should be made in the future to increase accuracy of diagnosis of bTB in cattle.},

abstract={Background: Biomarkers predicting tuberculosis treatment response and cure would facilitate drug development. This study investigated expression patterns of the co-stimulation molecule NKG2D in human tuberculosis and treatment to determine its potential usefulness as a host biomarker of tuberculosis drug efficacy. Methods: Tuberculosis patients (n = 26) were recruited in Lahore, Pakistan, at diagnosis and followed up during treatment. Household contacts (n = 24) were also recruited. NKG2D expression was measured by qRT-PCR in RNA samples both ex vivo and following overnight mycobacterial stimulation in vitro. Protein expression of NKG2D and granzyme B was measured by flow cytometry. Results: NKG2D expression in newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients was similar to household contacts in ex vivo RNA, but was higher following in vitro stimulation. The NKG2D expression was dramatically reduced by intensive phase chemotherapy, in both ex vivo blood RNA and CD8+ T cell protein expression, but then reverted to higher levels after the continuation phase in successfully treated patients. Conclusion: The changes in NKG2D expression through successful treatment reflect modulation of the peripheral cytotoxic T cell response. This likely reflects firstly in vivo stimulation by live Mycobacterium tuberculosis, followed by the response to dead bacilli, antigen-release and finally immunopathology resolution. Such changes in host peripheral gene expression, alongside clinical and microbiological indices, could be developed into a biosignature of tuberculosis drug-induced cure to be used in future clinical trials. © 2013 Hassan et al.},

abstract={Genitourinary tuberculosis is a disease of the genitourinary system which includes the entire urinary tract and reproductive system. Genital tuberculosis is an important cause of female infertility, especially in developing nations like India. In the present study, a total of 257 clinical specimens comprising of endometrial biopsy (109), endometrial curetting (42), menstrual blood (8), semen (17), placenta (11) and urine (70) were collected from patients and subjected for PCR, Culture and AFB detection. The endometrial biopsy, endometrial curetting, menstrual blood, semen, placenta, urine showed 30.2, 45.2,12.5, 5.8, 27.2, 31.4 %, positivity rate for tuberculosis by PCR, 7.3, 9.5, 25.0, 0, 9, 8.5 % by culture and 1.8, 2.3, 0, 0, 0, 2.8 % respectively by AFB smear. Being a novel, rapid technique, PCR is the method of choice for rapid diagnosis and management of genitourinary tuberculosis shared with the other concerned tests.

abstract={The aim of this study was to assess the value of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA) (T-SPOT.TB) for patients with suspected osteoarticular tuberculosis (TB) in comparison with conventional and molecular methods. Of 145 patients with suspected osteoarticular TB, recruited from Beijing Chest Hospital between July 2011 and June 2012, 86 (59.3%)had osteoarticular TB (26 with culture-confirmed TB, 60 with probable TB), 24 (16.6%) were not having active TB. The remaining 17 (11.7%) inconclusive TB and 18 (12.4%) possible TB were excluded from final analysis. In addition to conventional tests and molecular method, T-SPOT.TB assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells to examine IFN-γ response to early secretory antigenic target 6 and culture filtrate protein 10 was also performed. The sensitivity and specificity for T-SPOT.TB assay were 94.2% and 70.8%, respectively. A statistically significant difference in sensitivity was found between T-SPOT.TB assay (94.2%) and other tests (acid-fast bacilli smear (19.7%), culture (34.2%), real-time PCR (36.8%); P < 0.01, respectively). These results suggested that the IGRA assay could provide useful aids in the diagnosis of osteoarticular TB. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={As tuberculosis is still a worldwide infection and buffalo breeding represents an important economic activity in various countries, the purpose of this study was to employ an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using MPB70 as a capture antigen for the diagnosis of naturally occurring tuberculosis in water buffaloes in Brazil. After the introduction of newly acquired cattle onto a tuberculosis (TB) free farm, an outbreak of TB was recorded in a mixed herd comprising water buffaloes (21) and cattle (46). The entire herd was tested by intradermal tuberculin injection (ITT) and positive animals were slaughtered and tested by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and ELISA. From the 21 buffaloes sampled, three were reactive by ITT. All the three had positive culture and ELISA, while PCR was positive in two of them. Besides that, one ITT-negative buffalo was slaughtered and presented positive results by both culture and ELISA, and was considered as anergic. Although there were only few animals, those findings demonstrate the diagnostic usefulness of an MPB70-ELISA to correctly detect Mycobacterium bovis tuberculosis in water buffaloes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection occurs in 0 to 36% of critically III patients, mostly between 4 and 12 days after Intensive care units (ICUs) admission. Research reported that the ICU stay and mechanical ventilation days of the critically ill patients with CMV infections were longer than those without CMV infections. Studies have suggested that immunocompromised patients such as cancer patients, organ transplant recipients and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with positive CMV- polymerase chain reaction (PGR) results should be early initiated with antl-CMV therapy to reduce mortality. However, it remains controversial to treat the ICU patients without Immunosuppression when the CMV-PCR results were positive. The 74 years old man was brought to the Emergency Room of the hospital due to fever and short of breath. He was intubated for acute respiratory failure and was admitted to the ICU. The CXR showed diffuse miliary lesions over bilateral lung fields. The acid-fast bacilli stain and tuberculosis (TB)-PCR of the sputum both showed positive, so he was mainly given anti-TB therapy. But the patient continued with instability of oxygen saturation, and bilateral pneumonia has not improved. Meanwhile, the CMV-PCR of the sputum and blood showed positive, thus active CMV infection was suspected and ganciclovir infusion was Initiated. But afterS days of ganciclovir therapy, the patient still passed away. We recognized a difficult-to-treal case while facing such a severely life-threatening Illness, therefore, we remind the possible co-infection of milary tuberculosis and CMV infection and suggest a trial of early diagnosis and early initiation of therapy to control progressive worsening of CMV Infection, In order to cure the illness.},

abstract={Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection causes a chronic granulomatous inflammatory regional enteritis in ruminants. Cell-mediated immune responses are assumed to be protective and therefore, to be associated with its more delimited lesion types, while humoral responses are mainly associated with diffuse histopathological lesions. However, this duality of immune responses has been recently questioned. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between both types of immunological responses and the type and extension of intestinal lesions and the presence of MAP in bovine tissues. Standard histopathological examinations, two microbiological procedures (culture and real time PCR (rtPCR)), as well as MAP specific antibody and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRA) were performed on tissues and blood of 333 slaughtered Holstein-Friesian animals. Paratuberculous lesions were observed in 176 (52.9%) of the animals and overall MAP detection rates were estimated at 13.5% and 28.5% for tissue culture and rtPCR, respectively. Unlike the relatively constant non-specific IFN-γ release, both the antibody levels and the specific IFN-γ release significantly increased with tissue damage. Delimited immunopathological forms, which accounted for 93.2% of all forms, were mostly related to positive testing in the IGRA (38.4%) whereas diffuse ones (6.8%) were associated with antibody seropositivity (91.7%). However, since the frequency of positive immune responses in both tests increased as the lesions severity increased, polarization of Th1/Th2 responses was less prominent than expected. MAP was detected in the majority of ELISA-positive animals (culture+: 90%, rtPCR+: 85%) but the bacteria was only confirmed in the 36.1% of IGRA-positive animals by any of the two microbiological tests. In terms of diagnosis, the antibody test was a good indicator of advanced tissue damage (diffuse forms), but the IGRA did not associate well with more delimited forms or with MAP detection. © 2013 Vazquez et al.},

abstract={India continues to have the highest number of TB cases in the world, and over 2 million cases are reported in India every year. The private sector in India is an important source of TB care with over 50% of TB patients seeking TB treatment in the private health sector. Early and accurate diagnosis is the first critical step in controlling TB. All persons with cough lasting two weeks or more, or with unexplained chronic fever and/or weight loss should be evaluated for TB. For pulmonary TB, Sputum is the most critical sample for laboratory testing. Although blood is a popular sample in the Indian private sector, there is no accepted, valid blood test for pulmonary TB. There are three accepted, validated sputum tests for active TB: Sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli; molecular or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT); and culture. Chest radiography is useful but is not specific for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. Therefore, chest radiography cannot provide a conclusive diagnosis on its own, and needs to be followed by sputum testing. If sputum smears and NAATs are negative, and TB is still suspected, cultures are the most sensitive tests available for TB.Culture is therefore very useful in diagnosing smear-negative TB, and drug-resistant TB. Blood-based antibody tests (eg, IgG/IgM tests) and interferon-gamma release assays (eg, TB Gold) are not accurate and should not be used for pulmonary TB diagnosis. In fact, use of serodiagnostic tests for TB is banned by the Government of India.},

abstract={The clinical features of abdominal tuberculosis (TB) are non-specific and establishing a diagnosis remains a challenge. A delay in diagnosis is likely to increase the morbidity in these patients. We developed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 16SrRNA, IS6110, and devR, and evaluated it in comparison with other conventional tests in clinical suspects of abdominal TB. A total of 183 patients with clinical suspicion of abdominal TB (96 patients with intestinal TB and 87 with peritoneal TB) were enrolled for the study. Endoscopic or intraoperative biopsies were collected from patients suspected of intestinal TB and ascitic fluid was collected from patients with a suspicion of peritoneal TB. Of the intestinal tuberculosis group, there were 40 confirmed cases and 56 controls, while of the peritoneal tuberculosis group there were 37 confirmed cases and 50 controls. Multiplex PCR showed a high sensitivity and specificity in both the intestinal TB and peritoneal TB groups. When combined with histopathology, multiplex PCR could detect 97.5% of all the cases in the intestinal tuberculosis group, while in combination adenosine deaminase levels (ADA) in cases of peritoneal tuberculosis it increased the specificity of diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis to 95%. In combination with histopathology in suspected intestinal TB cases, and ADA testing in suspected peritoneal TB cases, it can be used as a highly sensitive, specific, and rapid diagnostic tool with the ability to supplement the limitations of other diagnostic modalities. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for detection of Mycobacterium leprae DNA from whole blood. Whole-blood specimens were subjected to nested-PCR amplification of M. leprae repeat DNA sequences in 49 multibacillary (MB) and 30 paucibacillary (PB) leprosy patients, 96 household contacts (HHCs), 18 tuberculosis (TB) patients, and 35 normal healthy individuals. M. leprae DNA was detected in 95.92% (47/49) of MB, 70% (21/30) of PB, and 6.25% (6/96) of HHC, but it was not detected in 18 TB or 35 normal controls. The sensitivities of the anti-bovine serum albumin (ND-O-BSA) immunoglobulin M (IgM) and antifusion protein of ML0405-ML2331 IgG for MB were 97.96% and 89.8%, and these values for PB were 70% and 53.33%. However, the ND-O-BSA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) had lower specificity, with relatively high false-positive results for TB patients (16.67%) and normal healthy controls (10%).

abstract={Background:Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection has been suggested to contribute to the pathogenesis of erythema nodosum (EN) and nodular vasculitis (NV), the classic forms of panniculitis. However, there is little evidence to demonstrate the presence of MTB in the skin lesions. This study is aimed at evaluating the association between MTB infection and the development of EN and NV in a Chinese population.Methods:A total of 107 patients (36 EN, 27 NV, and 44 others) with vasculitis and 40 control cases with other skin diseases were recruited and their skin lesion samples were subjected to real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the IS6110 and mpt64 gene fragments of MTB. Their blood mononuclear cells were tested for MTB antigen-specific IFN-γ responses by QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In-Tube (IT) assays.Results:PCR analysis revealed that 7/23 (30.4%) and 7/18 (38.9%) of the EN and NV samples were positive for the IS6110 DNA, respectively, which were significantly higher than 3/34 (8.8%) of other vasculitis (OV) and 3/40 (7.5%) of the control samples (p<0.05). The nested Real-Time PCR assay indicated that 6/7 (86%) of the IS6110-positive EN samples, all of the IS6110-positive NV and control samples, but only 1/3 of the IS6110-positive OV samples, were positive for the mpt64 gene. Similarly, 19/32 (59.4%) of the EN patients, 20/26 (76.9%) of the NV patients, and 17/36 (47.2%) of the OV patients were positive for MTB antigen-specific IFN-γ responses, which were significantly higher than 6/40 (15%) of the controls (p<0.05).Conclusion:Our data strongly suggest that MTB infection and active TB are associated with the development of NV and EN in Chinese. © 2013 Chen et al.},

abstract={The aetiology of pericardial effusion has been generally assessed by clinical work-up only, which leaves a large cohort of patients with "idiopathic" effusions virtually undiagnosed. In accordance with the ESC guidelines, this contribution intends to change this attitude. After therapeutic or diagnostic pericardiocentesis of 259 patients with large to moderate pericardial effusions, pericardial fluid, epicardial and pericardial biopsies, and blood samples were analysed by PCR for cardiotropic microbial agents. Cytology, histology, immunohistology of tissue and fluids and laboratory tests were performed. Of the 259 patients, 35 % suffered from an autoreactive aetiology, 28 % suffered from a malignant and 14 % from an infectious cause. Investigating all samples by PCR, we identified viral genomes in 51 (19.7 %) patients, parvovirus B19 (B19 V) being identified in 25 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in 19 cases. In patients with a sole infectious aetiology (n = 36), B19 V was detected in 21 and EBV in 10 cases. When differentiating with regard to the material investigated for the presence of cardiotropic viruses, parvovirus B19 was most often detected in the epicardium and EBV was most frequently detected in the pericardial fluid independent from the final diagnostic categorisation. Bacterial cultures including tests for tuberculosis were all negative. Molecular techniques improve sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy for the underlying aetiology in pericarditis patients with effusion. The identification of specific viral signatures will help to understand pathogenetic mechanisms in pericarditis and allow to tailor an adequate therapy beyond antiphlogistic treatment. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Though an 8cm mass in liver segment 5/8 was detected by abdominal imaging, we could not confirm the diagnosis because findings on physical examination, blood chemistry, and radiologic examination were nonspecific. No cancer or immunocompromising diseases were found. We performed a liver biopsy because we were suspicious of a cold abscess caused by tuberculosis. Purulent material acquired from the biopsy revealed positive TB-PCR results, which confirmed the diagnosis of solitary liver tuberculosis. She received anti-tuberculosis medications leading to hepatic tumor resolution.

abstract={Rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) infection is critical in clinical practice. To establish an effec-tive serological diagnostic technique, we generated the several Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific immunogenic antigens and evaluated the clinical benefits of detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies raised against these target antigens for the diagnosis of patients with active TB. The genes encoding the MTB-specific antigens 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target of MTB (ESAT-6), 10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP-10), ESX-1 substrate protein C (ESPC), 14KD/38KD and ESAT-6/14KD/38KD, were ampli-fied from the MTB genome by PCR. Prokaryotic vectors were constructed for the expression of the individual MTB antigens. The target recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21/DE3) and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). An ELISA based immunoassay was set up using these target antigens for the diagnosis of active TB. The detection samples included 98 patients with active TB and 102 healthy control volun-teers. The cutoff OD value for IgG and IgM antibodies was selected according to a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The sensitivity, specificity and positive likelihood ratio were also determined. We successfully cloned, expressed and purified the ESAT-6, CFP-10, ESPC, 14KD/38KD and ESAT-6/14KD/38KD recombinant antigens of MTB. The mean levels of IgG antibodies were significantly higher in patients with pulmonary TB compared with control groups. The target MTB-specific antigens can distinguish a TB infec-tion from a non-TB infection, showing significant difference in statistics (P<0.001). The sensitivity of the IgG test ranged from 69.4% (ESAT-6) to 77.6% (ESAT-6/14KD/38KD) in the active TB patients; the specificity of assays varied from 78.4% (CFP-10) to 90.2% (14KD+38KD) in the healthy control groups. The IgM antibody test can not distinguish a TB infection from a non-TB healthy control. In conclusion, clinical use of the ESAT-6, CFP-10, ESPC, 14KD/38KD and ESAT-6/14KD/38KD antigens based on serodiagnostic IgG assay is of significant value for the rapid diagnosis of TB and for the discrimination between active TB patients and healthy controls.},

abstract={Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) is usually elevated in ovarian cancer. However, there are several reports that serum CA-125 is elevated in tuberculosis. This study investigated the clinical significance of serum CA-125 measurements in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Between September 2008 and March 2011, Serum CA-125 was measured in patients with active pulmonary TB before treatment (baseline), and 6 and 12 months after initiation of anti-TB treatment. Patients with pulmonary TB confirmed by culture or polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB-PCR) were included. The study enrolled 100 patients. The mean serum CA-125 was 38.9 ± 41.4 U/ml (reference value, <35 U/ml). Thirty-eight patients showed elevated CA-125. Significantly more of those with elevated CA-125 were female (p < 0.001), and had a positive sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) (p = 0.030). They also significantly more showed extensive pulmonary lesions on chest X-ray (p = 0.004). Elevated CA-125 was independently associated with female gender (OR = 12.5, 95% CI: 3.4-45.2), positive acid-fast staining of sputum (OR = 6.0, 95% CI: 1.8-19.7), cavitary lung lesion (OR = 4.0, 95% CI: 1.2-12.9), and involvement of more than one lung on chest X-ray (OR = 9.4, 95% CI: 2.2-40.1). The CA-125 level decreased with anti-TB treatment (p = 0.001). Serum CA-125 was related to the activity and severity of pulmonary TB, and it may be useful in the monitoring of therapeutic responses in certain cases of active pulmonary TB, especially in female patients of active pulmonary TB. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The deadly combination of tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) currently ravaging the world, taking a toll of about 0.35 million people every year, is one of the major public health crises of the decade. Throughout the course of HIV infection, the risk of acquisition, reactivation, and reinfection of TB keeps increasing substantially as the immune deficiency progresses. TB coinfected patients inadvertently facilitate HIV infection by release of the proinflammatory cytokines and overexpression of coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5; thereby, the progression of each is facilitated. The difficulties in diagnosing active tuberculosis in HIV-infected individuals poses a great challenge that is further complicated by the challenges in identification of latent TB infection, creating a setback to preventive therapy. Furthermore, prescribing antituberculous therapy and antiretroviral therapy together poses several management challenges, including drug interactions, added toxicities, and TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The current approach to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies in TB and HIV coinfected individuals, along with epidemiology and overview of pathogenetic interplay of both microbes, is reviewed here. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of IS6110, in vitro T-SPOT.TB, tuberculin skin test (TST), immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to MTB (protein chip), serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA IgG, chronic inflammatory bowel disease profile) and acid-fast staining of biopsied colonic tissue specimens were performed. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine their concordance with the diagnosis and its sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Results: Abnormal pulmonary X-ray, ascites and lesions of both cecum and ascending colon were more associated with ITB, while intestinal surgery and lesions of both ileum and adjacent colon were more commonly seen in CD. Significant diagnostic concordance was found using T-SPOT.TB (κ=0.786) by consistency test. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of T-SPOT.TB were 86%, 93%, 88% and 91%, respectively, and the sensitivity and NPV were significantly higher than other examinations (P<0.05). Conclusion: T-SPOT.TB is a valuable assay in differentiating ITB from CD, particularly in the diagnostic exclusion of ITB based on its high specificity and NPV. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Opportunistic infections, especially reactivation with M. tuberculosis, are major complications during treatment with anti-TNF agents. Infections with atypical mycobacteria like Mycobacterium marinum are rare and tend to turn into a difficult and prolonged course due to delayed diagnosis. This is the first case of M. marinum infection during adalimumab therapy in a patient with Crohn's disease. The most important diagnostic step was a detailed medical history as PCR tested for M. tuberculosis and for atypical subspecies was false negative. Up to now a discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy has been recommended, however, there is no consensus about the reintroduction of biologicals after sufficient anti-infective therapy. In this patient anti-TNF therapy had to be reintroduced because of increasing activity with no relapse of M. marinum after a follow-up of 12. months. © 2012 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation.},

abstract={Introduction: There are limited data on paediatric HIV care and treatment programmes in low-resource settings. Methods: A standardized survey was completed by International epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS paediatric cohort sites in the regions of Asia-Pacific (AP), Central Africa (CA), East Africa (EA), Southern Africa (SA) and West Africa (WA) to understand operational resource availability and paediatric management practices. Data were collected through January 2010 using a secure, web-based software program (REDCap). Results: A total of 64,552 children were under care at 63 clinics (AP, N =10; CA, N =4; EA, N =29; SA, N =10; WA, N =10). Most were in urban settings (N =41, 65%) and received funding from governments (N =51, 81%), PEPFAR (N =34, 54%), and/or the Global Fund (N =15, 24%). The majority were combined adult-paediatric clinics (N =36, 57%). Prevention of mother-to-child transmission was integrated at 35 (56%) sites; 89% (N =56) had access to DNA PCR for infant diagnosis. African (N =40/53) but not Asian sites recommended exclusive breastfeeding up until 4-6 months. Regular laboratory monitoring included CD4 (N =60, 95%), and viral load (N =24, 38%). Although 42 (67%) sites had the ability to conduct acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears, 23 (37%) sites could conduct AFB cultures and 18 (29%) sites could conduct tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing. Loss to follow-up was defined as >3 months of lost contact for 25 (40%) sites, >6 months for 27 sites (43%) and >12 months for 6 sites (10%). Telephone calls (N =52, 83%) and outreach worker home visits to trace children lost to follow-up (N =45, 71%) were common. Conclusions: In general, there was a high level of patient and laboratory monitoring within this multiregional paediatric cohort consortium that will facilitate detailed observational research studies. Practices will continue to be monitored as the WHO/UNAIDS Treatment 2.0 framework is implemented. © 2013 IeDEA Pediatric Working Group; licensee International AIDS Society.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death among HIV-infected adults, in part because of delayed diagnosis and therefore delayed initiation of treatment. Recently, the Gene-Xpert platform, a rapid, PCR-based diagnostic platform, has been validated for the diagnosis of TB with sputum. We have evaluated the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteremia and investigated its impact on clinical outcomes. Consecutive HIV-infected adults with fever and cough presenting to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, were recruited and followed up for 2 months. At presentation, three sputum samples were examined by smear, culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the presence of M. tuberculosis and blood was drawn for PCR with Xpert, for mycobacterial culture (Myco/F Lytic), and for aerobic culture. One hundred four patients were recruited, and 44 (43%) were sputum culture positive forM. tuberculosis. Ten were Xpert blood positive, for a sensitivity of 21% and a specificity of 100%. The 2-week mortality rate was significantly higher among patients who were Xpert blood positive than among those who were negative (40% versus 3%; multivariate odds ratio [OR] for death if positive, 44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3 to 662). This effect persisted on assessment of the mortality rate at 2 months (40% versus 11%; OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 24.6). When screening uncomplicated patients presenting with a productive cough for pulmonary TB, Xpert blood offers no diagnostic advantage over sputum testing. Despite this, Xpert blood positivity is highly predictive of early death and this test rapidly identifies a group of patients in urgent need of initiation of treatment. © 2013 Feasey et al.},

abstract={We have developed a novel blood lysis-centrifugation approach for highly sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection in large volumes of blood with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. One through 20 ml of blood was spiked with 0.25 to 10 CFU/ml of theM. tuberculosis surrogateM. bovis BCG. Multiple replicates of each sample were processed by a new lysis-centrifugation method and tested with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The assay was very sensitive with increased blood volumes. In the 20-ml samples, BCG was detected in blood spiked with 10, 5, 1, and 0.25 CFU/ml 100, 100, 83, and 57% of the time, respectively, compared to 100, 66, 18, and 18%, of the time, respectively, in 1-ml blood samples. Assay sensitivity was influenced by the type of anticoagulant used, with acid-citrate-dextrose solution B (ACD-B) providing the best results. A limit of detection of 10 CFU/ml was established with BCG spiked into ACD-B-treated blood, and 92, 36, and 33% of the samples with 5, 1, and 0.5 CFU/ml, respectively, were assay positive. The lysis buffer was stable both at room temperature and at 4°C for 2 months. The assay was tested with blood stored for 8 days without a change in sensitivity as measured by cycle threshold. This new assay format extends the capability of the Xpert MTB/RIF test, enabling up to 20 ml of blood to be tested rapidly for the presence of M. tuberculosis. This approach may be a useful method to detect extrapulmonary tuberculosis and the risk of death in immunocompromised patients. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.},

abstract={Background: The microbiologic diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis is difficult because most lesions harbor only a small number of mycobacteria that cannot usually be detected by staining for the organism or by culture. Nucleic acid amplification tests based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are potentially useful in this situation. Aims: To evaluate the utility of mRNA PCR and DNA PCR in the diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis. Methods: Biopsies from 28 cases of cutaneous tuberculosis and 19 controls with other diseases were subjected to microbiologic tests including direct smears for mycobacteria, culture and both mRNA PCR and DNA PCR. The laboratory was blinded to the clinical diagnosis. Results: None of the patients or controls showed a positive reaction on mRNA PCR test. Seven of 28 cases and 5 out of 19 controls showed a positive result on DNA PCR test yielding a sensitivity of 25% and a specificity of 73.7%. Conclusion: The results of PCR tests in cutaneous tuberculosis should be interpreted in the light of clinical and histopathological findings.},

abstract={The interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA) is widely used as a diagnostic method for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). The QuantiFERON-TB Gold and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube (QFT-IT) tests measure plasma IFN-γ levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and T-SPOT.TB counts IFN-γ-producing cells using enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. IFN-γ mRNA was evaluated as an indicator of IGRA in comparison with QFT-IT IFN-γ ELISA in 46 subjects with active TB and in 73 at low risk for TB. Significant IFN-γ mRNA expression was detected from 30 min and peaked 4 h after stimulation with MTB antigens or mitogen. This was defined as the optimal time point for IFN-γ mRNA real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The sensitivities of IFN-γ mRNA real-time PCR and IFN-γ ELISA were 84.8% (39/46) and 89.1% (41/46), respectively (no significant difference). Although the specificities of IFN-γ ELISA was 4.1% higher than that of IFN-γ mRNA real-time PCR (60.3% versus 56.2%), the difference was not statistically significant. The overall agreement between IFN-γ mRNA real-time PCR and IFN-γ ELISA was 79.8% (kappa = 0.475). Whilst there was no difference in the performance of IFN-γ mRNA real-time PCR and IFN-γ ELISA, IFN-γ mRNA real-time PCR was superior to IFN-γ ELISA in terms of the time required for detection of MTB infection. © 2013 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract={A herd infected naturally with tuberculosis was investigated by different diagnostic methods. Ninety days after a screening test that identified 21 cows as skin test positive, a Comparative Intradermal Tuberculin Test (CITT) was performed in those 21 cows and in 29 other randomly selected skin test negative cows. Milk samples and nasal swabs were collected prior to the CITT for bacteriological culture and PCR, while blood samples were collected for IFN release and antibody responses to MPB70 and MPB83, at three time points post tuberculin injection. Animals positive by CITT were slaughtered and disease confirmation undertaken. Based on the Kappa test, IFN was comparable to the standard tests (culture, PCR and CITT) at all three sampling points. Results from both antibody ELI-SAs were similar but were not comparable to the standard tests. T-test analysis of the CITT, IFN and ELISAs demonstrated that their performances were not correlated. There is increasing recognition that individually, available diagnostic tests do not detect all infected cattle. Therefore, a comprehensive strategy for the diagnosis of bovine TB should include test results for the detection of both cellular and humoral immune responses where there may be animals at different stages of infection.},

abstract={The diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) depends on sputum-smear examination, mycobacterial culture and tuberculin skin testing (TST). Future diagnosis requires near-patient tests and early recognition of drug-resistant (DR) TB. Nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAAT) can detect approximately 100 bacilli?mL-1 and have moved from the laboratory into the field. Sensitivity can be improved by detecting proteins, using mass spectrometry, and their function, using reporter enzymes. Ultimately, microfluidics will permit reactions in restricted spaces with the potential to measure single molecules or sequence strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis directly. Metabolic products released by TB and the human response to infection can be described by a characteristic metabolome and volatome of exhaled air. Interferon-γ release assays (IGRA) are blood tests that indicate the immune response to the few bacilli responsible for latent TB infection (LTBI). Their sensitivity may be improved by cytokines released by activated macrophages (inducible protein-10). The pattern of the immune response to many or all TB antigens, the immunome, may in future distinguish between active disease and latent infection. © ERS 2012.},

abstract={Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) remains as one of the most neglected tropical diseases with over 60% of the world's total VL cases occurring in the Indian subcontinent. Due to the invasive risky procedure and technical expertise required in the classical parasitological diagnosis, the goal of the VL experts has been to develop noninvasive procedure(s) applicable in the field settings. Several serological and molecular biological approaches have been developed over the last decades, but only a few are applicable in field settings that can be performed with relative ease. Recently, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as a novel nucleic acid amplification method for diagnosis of VL. In this study, we have evaluated the LAMP assay using buffy coat DNA samples from VL patients in Bangladesh and compared its performance with leishmania nested PCR (Ln-PCR), an established molecular method with very high diagnostic indices. Methods. Seventy five (75) parasitologically confirmed VL patients by spleen smear microcopy and 101 controls (endemic healthy controls -25, non-endemic healthy control-26, Tuberculosis-25 and other diseases-25) were enrolled in this study. LAMP assay was carried out using a set of four primers targeting L. donovani kinetoplast minicircle DNA under isothermal (62 °C) conditions in a heat block. For Ln-PCR, we used primers targeting the parasite's small-subunit rRNA region. Results: LAMP assay was found to be positive in 68 of 75 confirmed VL cases, and revealed its diagnostic sensitivity of 90.7% (95.84-81.14, 95% CI), whereas all controls were negative by LAMP assay, indicating a specificity of 100% (100-95.43, 95% CI). The Ln-PCR yielded a sensitivity of 96% (98.96-87.97, 95% CI) and a specificity of 100% (100-95.43, 95% CI). Conclusion: High diagnostic sensitivity and excellent specificity were observed in this first report of LAMP diagnostic evaluation from Bangladesh. Considering its many fold advantages over conventional PCR and potential to be used as a simple and rapid test in the VL endemic areas of the Indian subcontinent, our findings are encouraging, but further evaluation of LAMP is needed. © 2012 Khan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: The diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis (TB) is complex and most of the new diagnostics for TB are for adults. Aims: To review the performance of TB diagnostics and their suitability to its characteristics in young children. Methods: Expert opinion and review of the literature. Main findings: The lack of a sufficient number of research studies on TB diagnostics for children hinders the preparation of systematic literature reviews. Information on test performance in children is often extrapolated from studies in adults and there is a dearth of evidence of test performance in children. Approaches to shorten the time required for diagnosis (by using a variety of specimens) are needed and there is preliminary evidence that such schemes are feasible. Diagnostics based on smear microscopy such as LED-FM, serological tests and IGRAS are unlikely to improve the diagnosis of active TB in children. Liquid and the MODS culture methods are more sensitive than solid culture, and new methods to detect mycobacterium nucleic acid or its components such as TrDNA fragments, LAMP assays and Xpert MTB/RIF have good potential to increase the number of cases confirmed. These tests should be evaluated in specimens which are easily accessible in children such as fine-needle aspiration biopsy, urine, blood and stools. Interpretation: The evaluation of new diagnostic tests for TB in children is overdue. The lack of suitable diagnostic tests hinders the proper management of children, the assessment of the real burden of childhood TB, evaluation of the efficacy of new treatments and vaccines and, ultimately, the development of effective control interventions. © W.

abstract={Background: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a means to amplify nucleic acids has become an essential element in diagnosis of infections. It has evolved into a simple and rapid, easy- to- use approach. At present there are no published guidelines for the usage of PCR technology for the diagnosis of infections of the nervous system. Methods: We reviewed the advantages and pitfalls of PCR in order to guide neurologists and infectious diseases experts in its application for the diagnosis of infections of the nervous system. Medical reference systems were searched, and original papers, meta-analyses, review papers, book chapters and guidelines recommendations were reviewed. The final literature search was performed in May 2012. Recommendations were reached by consensus. Recommendations: The reliability of PCR technology for the diagnosis of neurological infections is currently based on the pathogens. The main contribution of PCR is to the diagnosis of viral infections followed by bacterial CNS infections with the notable exception of tuberculous meningitis. Efficacy for the diagnosis of protozoal infections and helminthic infestations has also been established in many instances. Unfortunately, current molecular PCR technology is far from becoming routine in resource-poor countries where such infections are prevalent. Despite the importance of fungal infections in the context of the immune-compromised host, there is not enough data to recommend the routine use of PCR. Conclusions: PCR technology is currently a reliable method for the diagnosis of viral and bacterial (except tuberculosis) infections, and only for some protozoal infections and helminthic infestations. © 2012 EFNS.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of FNA, Tb-PCR, and CBC as an initial work-up protocol for cervical lymphadenopathy to reiterate the importance of CBC in terms of predicting the clinical course. In this consecutive case series, 158 patients with cervical lymphadenopathy were enrolled. All patients underwent FNA and CBC, with or without Tb-PCR. The validity of combined FNA ± Tb-PCR and CBC in the diagnosis of diseases requiring deWnitive treatment was evaluated. Final diagnoses were self-limiting disease in 110 (69.6%), malignancy in 19 (12.0%), and tuberculosis in 26 (16.5%). Sensitivity of FNA ± Tb-PCR was 66.7% and of added CBC proWle was 97.9%. Patients with neutropenia or lymphocytosis were found to have a higher chance of spontaneous recovery than patients with a normal WBC proWle. FNA and Tb-PCR were found to be important in patients aged more than 20. The results indicate that FNA, Tb-PCR, and CBC are basic and essential in initial work-up for cervical lymphadenopathy. In particular, CBC was found to aid in detecting critical diseases and predicting the likelihood of open biopsy in patients with negative FNA and Tb-PCR.

abstract={The standard method for detection of bovine tuberculosis (TB) is the single intradermal tuberculin test (SITT). Nevertheless, current studies suggest that a single test is not enough to detect all cattle infected by TB, particularly when animals present different stages of infection. A dairy herd comprised of 270 cows was studied and 15 were reactive to SITT plus nine inconclusive animals. Blood samples (for IFN and ELISA) were collected from these 24 cows. At 30 days after injection of PPD, all the cows that were reactive to any of the employed tests were slaughtered, and tissues were processed by Bacteriology, Histopathology (HP) and PCR. According to HP 33.4% of the animals were positive, 45.8% inconclusive and 20.8% were negative. The inconclusive samples came from IFN positive animals, signalizing recent infection. Regarding the animals that were negative to HP, all of them were identified by IFN while ELISA was negative. Immune responses are different in recent and advanced infections, what supports the identification between chronically or recently infected animals. This multidisciplinary approach is mandatory for the interpretation of the various tools that are frequently employed for the diagnosis of TB and mainly to identify all infected animals.},

In this report, we present the medical history of an immunocompetent 32-year-old man presented with a painful swelling of the right dorsal wrist. Initial inflammation onset had occurred 6 months before he consulted our service, resulting in consultation of several physicians and extensive diagnostic procedures without gaining a specific diagnosis. Finally, after extensive diagnostic tests, a tenosynovectomy was performed and tuberculosis-induced extensor tenosynovitis was detected. The diagnosis was established by positive histology, repeated specific PCR and T-SPOT.TB.

abstract={This research paper describes study of the lung diseases diagnosis software with Influenza and Tuberculosis as the cases study. Influenza is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory tract. In Indonesia, numerous number of Avian-Influenza (H5N1) cases occurred in rural area, such as cases in Garut, Jawa Barat in 2006 which started in Cikelet district causing 14 infected-cases and 5 death-cases and has put Garut in an emergency situation until 2010. The H5N1 detection in rural area requires fast yet accurate diagnosis result to enable immediate curative actions. The most accurate result is provided by RT-PCR (Reverse-Transcription Polymerase-Chain-Reaction), which is high investment, and usually locates in urban area. Another diagnostic tool, rapid diagnostic test, is most common tool but gives inaccurate result because of its low sensitivity and specificity. In case of Tuberculosis, Indonesia ranks number 3, after India and China, as a country with most number of infected-people. Symptoms are chronic-cough with blood-tinged-sputum, fever, night-sweats and weight-loss. Tuberculosis is diagnosed by identifying Mycobacterium-tuberculosis organism in clinical sample. When this is not possible, probable diagnosis may be made using imaging X-rays or scans, tuberculin skin test and/or Interferon-Gamma-Release-Assay (IGRA). The main problem with tuberculosis diagnosis is difficulty in culturing this slow-growing organism in laboratory, which may take 4 to 12 weeks for blood or sputum-culture. The requirement is to create a first-hand diagnostic tool which allows paramedic mobility to rural areas for Influenza/Tuberculosis diagnostic purposes. The study first introduces lung auscultation method, then analysis and preliminary design of lung diseases diagnosis software. To enable each Lung Health for Public Council (Balai Besar Kesehatan Paru Masyarakat) and Health Service Office (Dinas Kesehatan) within province/region/country as data owner to maintain its own data, and to provide the data confidentiality as well, the cloud computing environment is then applied. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This is an exciting time for tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics. The technology for rapid diagnosis of TB and rifampicin (RMP) resistance in pulmonary sputum smearpositive specimens is well advanced, and assays have high specificity with good sensitivity. Nevertheless, the current sensitivity of TB detection means that these assays still cannot replace the standard diagnostic methods for TB or conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). In extra-pulmonary specimens, the performance of molecular tools varies and should be considered separately for each specimen type. Evidence for the use of these assays for TB and drug resistance detection in individuals co-infected with TB and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is limited. As the positive predictive value for RMP resistance reaches ≥90% only when the prevalence of RMP resistance in new TB patients is >15%, which is rare globally, many cases with such resistance will be false-resistant, emphasising the need for a secondary confirmative test. Similarly, increased (or incorrect) diagnosis of TB may compromise programme effectiveness by increasing the numbers of individuals requiring anti-tuberculosis treatment, unless it is carefully planned. For the future, 1) assays with greater sensitivity for TB detection are needed; 2) rapid diagnostics for paediatric TB are important, and there is a need for carefully designed studies, including those involving HIV-positive children; 3) more clinical data need to be obtained from longitudinal studies, especially related to the influence of rapid diagnostics on disease outcome; and 4) point-of-care tests using untreated sputum, blood or urine and little or no equipment would be of immeasurable benefit. Although great progress has been made, we are not there yet. © 2012 The Union.},

However, limited data are available concerning clinical judgment in patients with suspected PTB and AFB smear- and PCR-negative bronchial aspirates (BA). The present study evaluated the usefulness of whole-blood QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) testing in these patients. Of 166 patients with suspected PTB who had undergone bronchoscopy because of smear-negative sputum or inadequate sputum production, 93 (56%) were diagnosed with culture-positive PTB. Seventy-four patients were either AFB smear- or PCR-positive. In the 75 patients whose BA AFB smear and PCR results were both negative, 19 were finally diagnosed with PTB by culture. The QFT test had a negative predictive value of 91% for PTB. The QFT test may be useful for excluding PTB in patients with suspected PTB whose BA AFB smear and PCR results are both negative. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Background: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is recognized with increasing frequency. A throbbing headache occurring or worsening in the upright position and improving after lying down, a so-called 'orthostatic headache', low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the major features of the classic syndrome. These patients, who are admitted with fever, headache, and CSF findings revealing lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein concentration, normal glucose levels, and negative culture results, are prone to be misdiagnosed with aseptic meningitis. The aims of this single-centre retrospective study were to determine the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of patients initially evaluated as having aseptic meningitis but subsequently diagnosed with SIH, and to touch upon the key points of the differential diagnosis in daily infectious diseases practice. Methods: Patients referred to Cerrahpasa Medical School with a presumed diagnosis of aseptic meningitis or viral meningitis between 1 January 2006 and 1 January 2011 were reviewed. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and follow-up data obtained from the hospital database were processed. Patients confirmed to have SIH syndrome were included for evaluation. Results: Eleven cases of SIH syndrome were diagnosed during the study period (8 male and 3 female, median age 30 y, range 2144 y). All had headache, hearing changes, and nausea. Vomiting (10/11) and posterior neck pain (9/11) were also frequent. Seven had fever and 5 had a stiff neck. Four cases had lymphocytic pleocytosis, 4 cases had elevated CSF protein concentrations (> 1.5 times the upper limit of normal), and 2 cases had slightly lower CSF glucose levels. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of the CSF for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, and enteroviruses were negative in all cases. MRI of the 11 cases revealed signs of spontaneous CSF leaks with diffuse pachymeningeal gadolinium enhancement (11/11), sagging of the brain (9/11), enlargement of the pituitary (6/11), engorgement of the venous structures (5/11), and subdural fluid collections (2/11). CSF leaks were demonstrated by intrathecal magnetic resonance or computed tomography myelography at different levels along the thoracic spine (7/11), cervico-thoracic junction (2/11), and thoraco-lumbar junction (2/11). Autologous blood injection into the spinal epidural space ('blood patch') was performed for treatment. Strict bed rest followed, and all patients recovered fully within a week; no recurrence or complication was observed during the follow-up periods, which ranged from 6 months to 5 y.Conclusions: Findings of fever, headache, and meningeal irritation are generally accepted as the clinical features of meningitis. When CSF findings are not characteristically compatible with bacterial meningitis and particularly when the headache is orthostatic in nature, SIH should also be included in the differential diagnosis. MRI findings are characteristic and clearly contribute to the differential diagnosis between viral meningitis and SIH. © 2012 Informa Healthcare.},

PCR was performed using a Thermal Cycler (Master Cycler, Eppendorf, Germany): an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 3 minutes was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds and extension at 72°C for 30 seconds and a final extension at 72°C for 7 minutes. The products were held at 4°C and later run on 1% agarose gel, stained with Ethidium bromide and visualized in ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator. Results: Out of a total 4620 samples for PCR, 299 were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6.5%). The percentage of samples from male patients were 63.2%. The mean age of patients was 38+11.5 years. Blood was the most frequent specimen received for PCR (46.66%), followed by body fluids (18.41%) and CSF (10.64%). Yield for different clinical samples was 63/471 for sputum (13.4%), 3/29 for endobronchial washings (10.3%), 59/851 for body fluids (6.9%) and 24/400 for urine (6%). Positive yield from blood was the lowest (101/2156, 4.7%). Conclusion: PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The highest positive yield was obtained from sputum and lowest from blood specimens.},

abstract={Background. High HIV burden countries have experienced a high burden of pleural TB in HIV-infected patients. Objective. To review the epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of pleural TB in HIV-infected patients. Methods. A literature search from 1950 to June 2011 in MEDLINE was conducted. Results. Two-hundred and ninety-nine studies were identified, of which 30 met the inclusion criteria. The immunopathogenesis as denoted by cells and cytokine profiles is distinctly different between HIV and HIV-uninfected pleural TB disease. Adenosine deaminase and interferon gamma are good markers of pleural TB disease even in HIV-infected patients. HIV-uninfected TB suspects with pleural effusions commonly have a low yield of TB organisms however the evidence suggests that in dually infected patients smear and cultures have a higher yield. The Gene Xpert MTB/RIF assay has significant potential to improve the diagnosis of pleural TB in HIV-positive patients. Conclusions. Pleural TB in HIV-infected patients has a different immunopathogenesis than HIV-uninfected pleural TB and these findings in part support the differences noted in this systematic review. Research should focus on developing an interferon gamma-based point of care diagnostic test and expansion of the role of Gene Xpert in the diagnosis of pleural TB. Copyright 2012 A.

abstract={Objective: Rapid diagnosis of genital tuberculosis (GTB) is essential as it is an important cause of infertility among women. Diagnosis can be done by imaging techniques, direct visualization by endoscopy, serology, histopathology, culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Laparoscopy detects macroscopic changes only; histology is only suggestive and not confirmatory unless acid fast bacilli (AFB) are demonstrated in the lesion but sensitivity is poor in paucibacillary disease. Culture methods are the gold standard but slow growth of most pathogenic mycobacteria delays the diagnosis. PCR can rapidly detect even few copies of DNA with high sensitivity and specificity. Aim: Comparative evaluation of AFB smear examination, culture in Middlebrook 7H9 media and IS6110 based real-time PCR assay for the detection of mycobacteria in various female genital samples. Materials and methods: A total of 555 female genital samples like endometrial and fallopian tube biopsies, menstrual blood and vaginal discharge were processed by modified Petroff's method. The deposit was used for detection of mycobacteria by AFB smear, culture on Middlebrook 7H9 media and IS6110 based real-time PCR. Results: Out of 555 samples, 25.22% (140/555) were positive by the combination of all the methods used. Overall positivity by real-time PCR alone was 23.78% (132/555), by culture 8.28% (46/555) and 2.70% (15/555) by AFB smear examination. Out of total positives, 94.28% (132/140) were positive by PCR alone, 32.85% (46/140) by culture and 10.71% (15/140) by AFB smear. Eight (5.71%) culture positive samples were negative by smear and PCR, six of these were nontubercular mycobacteria (NTM) and two samples had PCR inhibitors as confirmed by spiking with positive DNA. Contamination was observed in 25/555 (4.5%) which were reported negative by culture but three of these were PCR positive. AFB smear results were available in 1 hour, PCR in 1 day and culture in 4 to 6 weeks. Conclusion: PCR was found to be the most rapid and sensitive (94.28%) method, 9-fold more sensitive than smear examination and 3-fold than the culture for detection of mycobacteria. Results were available in 4 to 6 weeks time for culture but in only 1 day by PCR. IS6110 PCR can detect only MTB and not the NTM. Use of multiplex PCR with genus and MTB specific primers will increase the sensitivity of test but care needs to be taken to prevent false positivity due to cross contamination and false negative due to PCR inhibitors.},

abstract={We evaluated whether quantitative PCR (qPCR) and (1→3)-β-d-glucan assays could be used to differentiate Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) from Pneumocystis jirovecii colonization in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates. A total of 40 bronchoalveolar lavage samples and 107 induced sputum samples from 147 patients who were suspected of having PCP were obtained for PCR detection of P. jirovecii. Diagnoses of definite PCP, probable PCP, pneumonia with P. jirovecii colonization (colonization) and pneumonia without colonization (non-colonization) were made in 11, 42, 15 and 60 patients, respectively. A PCP diagnosis was undetermined in 19 patients. The copy numbers, determined using qPCR, were significantly higher in definite PCP and probable PCP patients than in colonized patients. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity for discriminating definite PCP from colonization were 0.96, 100.0% and 80.0%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 1300copies/mL. The values for discriminating probable PCP from colonization were 0.71, 66.7% and 73.3%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 340copies/mL. β-d-glucan levels were significantly higher in patients with both definite PCP and probable PCP than in colonized patients. The AUC, sensitivity and specificity for discriminating definite PCP were 0.91, 100.0% and 80.0%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 15.6pg/mL. The values for discriminating probable PCP were 0.78, 76.2% and 73.3%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 6.0pg/mL. Both qPCR and the β-d-glucan assay displayed high accuracy for discriminating colonization from definite PCP and displayed moderate accuracy for discriminating colonization from probable PCP. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Aim: To describe clinical and laboratory characteristics of pneumocystic pneumonia (PP) in patients with HIV-infection for improvement of diagnosis quality. Material and methods: Detailed examination was performed in 111 HIV-infected patients with suggested diagnosis of PP. The following investigations were made: clinical, x-ray examinations, total count and biochemical blood tests, enzyme immunoassay, indirect immunofluorescence reaction (II-FR) for Pneumocystis jiroveci antigens in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or induced sputum. For diagnosis of other secondary diseases PCR was used for investigation of BALF and bronchial biopsy to detect DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Candida albicans, Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Mycoplasma spa., Herpes simplex I, II. DNA of cytomegalovirus in blood was detected with PCR. Microscopic tests of the sputum were conducted for detection of acid-resistant mycobacteria. Results: PP was associated with other secondary diseases in 59% patients (pulmonary tuberculosis - 16%, CMV pneumonia - 31%, combination of all the lesions - 5%). PP diagnosis was cancelled and pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 12 patients. In combination of PP with other pathology dominant were symptoms observed in PP monoinfection and only effective anti-pneumocystic treatment revealed signs of comorbid pathology. Tuberculosis patients had weaker signs of respiratory failure, symmetric bilateral interstitial or small-focal alterations were detected less frequently. Conclusion: Current PP course characteristics in HIV infection are identified. In clinical diagnosis of PP special attention should be paid to data complex especially to increasing respiratory failure, high ESR, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low blood p O2, fast response to ex juvantibus therapy. The most effective method of the diagnosis verification - BALF IIFR.},

abstract={The high burden of tuberculosis (TB) among patients accessing antiretroviral treatment (ART) services in resource-limited settings is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and is associated with nosocomial transmission risk. These risks are greatly compounded by multidrug-resistant disease. Screening and diagnosis of TB in this clinical setting is difficult. However, progress has beenmade in defining a high-sensitivity, standardized symptom screening tool that assesses a combination of symptoms, rather than relying on report of cough alone. Moreover, newly emerging diagnostic tools show great promise in providing more rapid diagnosis of TB, which is predominantly sputum smear-negative. These include culture-based systems, simplified versions of nucleic acid amplification tests (such as the Xpert MTB/RIF assay), and detection of lipoarabinomannan antigen in urine. In addition, new molecular diagnostics now permit rapid detection of drug resistance.

abstract={Rationale: Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, although M. tuberculosis may play a role in the pathogenesis. The traditional view holds that inflammation in sarcoidosis is compartmentalized to involved organs. Objectives: To determine whether whole blood gene expression signatures reflect inflammatory pathways in the lung in sarcoidosis and whether these signatures overlap with tuberculosis. Methods: We analyzed transcriptomic data from blood and lung biopsies in sarcoidosis and compared these profiles with blood transcriptomic data from tuberculosis and other diseases. Measurements and Main Results: Applying machine learning algorithms to blood gene expression data, we built a classifier that distinguished sarcoidosis from health in derivation and validation cohorts (92% sensitivity, 92% specificity). The most discriminative genes were confirmed by quantitative PCR and correlated with disease severity. Transcript profiles significantly induced in blood overlapped with those in lung biopsies and identified shared dominant inflammatory pathways (e.g., Type-I/II interferons). Sarcoidosis and tuberculosis shared more overlap in blood gene expression compared with other diseases using the 86-gene signature reported to be specific for tuberculosis and the sarcoidosis signature presented herein, although reapplication of machine learning algorithms could identify genes specific for sarcoidosis. Conclusions: These data indicate that blood transcriptome analysis provides a noninvasive method for identifying inflammatory pathways in sarcoidosis, that these pathways may be leveraged to complement more invasive procedures for diagnosis or assessment of disease severity, and that sarcoidosis and tuberculosis share overlap in gene regulation of specific inflammatory pathways.

abstract={Background: Nucleic acid amplification assays including PCR have revolutionized the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Tuberculosis spread to almost every organ of the body and is characterized on the basis of localization of infection. Therefore, different types of body fluids and tissues can be used for the detection of MTB. From 2004 to 2010 total 766 different types of smear negative samples from patients, clinically suspected for tuberculosis were received and investigated at Division of Molecular Diagnostics, University of the Punjab Lahore for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Mycobacterial DNA was extracted followed by PCR amplification. Findings. A total of 356 (46.5%) samples were found positive by PCR for MTB. These included; serum (4.8%), blood (36.3%), urine (46.6%), cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) (42.1%), ascetic fluid (67.6%), pleural fluid (52%), pericardial fluid (30%), pus (38.6%), bone marrow (60%), sputum (38.8%) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (70%). Over all there was no significant difference in males and females neither in different age groups for the identification of MTB. Conclusion: We conclude that PCR is a useful and sensitive tool for the early diagnosis of MTB in variety of clinical samples. © 2010 Idrees et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Humans infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) can delete the pathogen or otherwise become latent infection or active disease. However, the factors influencing the pathogen clearance and disease progression from latent infection are poorly understood. This study attempted to use a genome-wide transcriptome approach to identify immune factors associated with MTB infection and novel biomarkers that can distinguish active disease from latent infection. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using microarray analysis, we comprehensively determined the transcriptional difference in purified protein derivative (PPD) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 12 individuals divided into three groups: TB patients (TB), latent TB infection individuals (LTBI) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 4 per group). A transcriptional profiling of 506 differentially expressed genes could correctly group study individuals into three clusters. Moreover, 55- and 229-transcript signatures for tuberculosis infection (TB&LTBI) and active disease (TB) were identified, respectively. The validation study by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) performed in 83 individuals confirmed the expression patterns of 81% of the microarray identified genes. Decision tree analysis indicated that three genes of CXCL10, ATP10A and TLR6 could differentiate TB from LTBI subjects. Additional validation was performed to assess the diagnostic ability of the three biomarkers within 36 subjects, which yielded a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 89%. Conclusions/Significance: The transcription profiles of PBMCs induced by PPD identified distinctive gene expression patterns associated with different infectious status and provided new insights into human immune responses to MTB. Furthermore, this study indicated that a combination of CXCL10, ATP10A and TLR6 could be used as novel biomarkers for the discrimination of TB from LTBI. © 2011 Lu et al.},

abstract={Objectives. Evaluation of different methods for an initial treatment decision in individuals with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Background. Recently, important advances regarding the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis have been introduced, which influence the decision to initiate anti-tuberculosis treatment. Methods. To evaluate the impact of different methods for the presumed diagnosis of tuberculosis, individuals with suspected tuberculosis were prospectively enrolled following a specific algorithm including initial smear microscopy and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) from sputum. In cases of negative initial test results, tuberculin skin testing, bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were performed. Results. Amongst 135 individuals with suspected tuberculosis, 42 had tuberculosis, 10 had nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary infection/colonization (one had both tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary infection/colonization) and 84 had an alternative final diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity were 41% and 99% [positive likelihood ratio (LR+)=40] for sputum microscopy and 31% and 98% (LR+=16) for BAL nucleic acid amplification, respectively. In patients with acid-fast bacilli smear-negative tuberculosis (25/42, 59.5%), M. tuberculosis-specific BAL fluid IGRA was 92% sensitive and 87% specific (LR+=7) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Conclusion. None of the microbiological or immunological methods that aim to provide a rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis whilst waiting the confirmation of the M. tuberculosis culture results is on its own accurate enough to diagnose or exclude pulmonary tuberculosis. Negative sputum microscopy and M. tuberculosis-specific NAAT results should prompt bronchoscopy including BAL for M. tuberculosis-specific IGRA in individuals with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. © 2011 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death worldwide attributable to a single infectious disease agent. India has more new TB cases annually than any other country. In 2008, India accounted for a fifth of the estimated 9.4 million TB cases globally. There is an overwhelming need for improving TB diagnostics in India through the use of cost effective, patient-friendly methods appropriate to different tiers of the country health system. Substantial progress has been made in India in the field of TB diagnosis and serious efforts have been made to herald the development of diagnostic tests for pulmonary TB, extra pulmonary TB and MDR-TB. Diverse approaches have been attempted towards improving smear microscopy, rapid culture and for differentiation between the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Several laboratories have developed in-house PCR assays for diagnosing TB with high accuracy. Approaches for distinguishing M. tuberculosis and/or Mycobacterium bovis infection and disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection in HIV-AIDS patients have also been described. Serological tests to detect antigens or antibodies to M. tuberculosis specific components by using cocktails of Excretory/Secretory protein antigens, Ag85 complex antigens, Hsp 65 antigen, RD1 antigens and Rapid Reverse Line Blot Hybridization assays to detect MDR-TB (mutations to rifampicin, isoniazid and streptomycin) have also been developed. Other methods like measurement of adenosine deaminase activity and use of luciferase reporter phages have also been explored for TB diagnosis. These advances in the Indian context are detailed in the present chapter. The validation and application of these methods in laboratory and public health settings is likely to result in improved TB diagnosis and contribute to effective disease management in India. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared the sensitivity of this assay to that of the ex vivo RD1 (ESAT-6 and CFP-10)-specific IFN-γ Elispot assay. We observed a clear quantitative correlation between the two assays (P&lt;0.001). Our assay proved to be a sensitive assay for the detection of MTB-specific T cells, could be performed on whole blood samples of fingerprick (50 uL) volumes, and was not affected by HIV-mediated immunosuppression.

abstract={The microbiologic etiology of severe pneumonia in hospitalized patients is rarely known in sub-Saharan Africa. Through a comprehensive diagnostic work-up, we aimed to identify the causative agent in severely ill patients with a clinical picture of pneumonia admitted to a high-dependency unit. A final diagnosis was made and categorized as confirmed or probable by using predefined criteria. Fifty-one patients were recruited (45% females), with a mean age of 35 years (range = 17-88 years), of whom 11(22%) died. Forty-eight (94%) of the patients were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus; 14 (29%) of these patients were receiving antiretroviral treatment. Final diagnoses were bacterial pneumonia (29%), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (27%), pulmonary tuberculosis (22%), and pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma (16%); 39 (77%) of these cases were confirmed cases. Fifteen (29%) patients had multiple isolates. At least 3 of 11 viral-positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were attributed clinical relevance.

abstract={Tuberculosis-related chronic granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTN) and chronic renal dysfunction as a consequence of GTN is a rarely seen clinical condition, with a few case reports in the literature. In this report, a case with end stage renal failure as an unexpected late extrapulmonary sequela of tuberculosis has been presented. A 60 years old female patient was admitted to hospital with the complaints of fever, malaise and nausea. Her history revealed that she had pulmonary tuberculosis 30 years ago and received antituberculosis therapy for nine months. The laboratory results on admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 90 mg/dl, serum creatinine 9 mg/dl, sodium 116 mEq/L, potassium 6.6 mEq/L, albumine 2.9 g/dl, hemoglobin, 8.4 g/dl, white blood cell count 10.800/mm3, C-reactive protein 187 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 110 mm/hour. Urinalysis showed 8.1 g/L protein, 10-12 leukocytes, 1-2 erythrocytes, while 24-hours urinalysis yielded proteinuria with 8 ml/minutes creatinine clearance value. Urine and blood cultures of the patient revealed neither bacteria or mycobacteria. PPD skin test was negative. Acid-resistant bacilli (ARB) were not detected in sequential urine samples obtained on three consecutive days. Since sputum samples could not be obtained, diagnostic procedures for sputum were not performed. Abdomen ultrasonography yielded bilateral edema and grade II echogenity in kidneys. Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral pulmonary nodules, chronic sequela lesions, pleural scarring and calcifications, as well as minimal interstitial infiltrate. Transthoracic lung biopsy showed chronic inflammation and fibrosis, while amyloid was negative. Renal biopsy showed GTN with central caseified necrosis and granulomas, multinuclear giant cells, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Amyloid was negative and ARB were not detected in renal biopsy sample. Definitive diagnosis was achieved by the demonstration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis nucleic acid in kidney biopsy by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antituberculosis therapy was not initiated since there were no signs of active tuberculosis. The patient became clinically stable following dialysis and was discharged, however, she has been undergoing hemodialysis three times a week. The aim of this case presentation was to emphasize that renal tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with end stage renal failure, especially in countries like Turkey where tuberculosis incidence is high.},

abstract={Lichen scrofulosorum is the most uncommon clinicopathologic variant of the tuberculids. Usually, the eruption appears in children and adolescents with strong immune sensitivity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and consists of tiny follicular papules, closely resembling lichen nitidus. We report a case of lichen scrofulosorum in an adult male with active cervical scrofuloderma who developed lesions of lichen scrofulosorum mimicking clinically lichen planus. Histopathologic study demonstrated granulomas around the hair follicles, although acid-fast bacilli stains, immunohistochemical stain for mycobacteria, polymerase chain reaction investigations and cultures failed to demonstrate Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the cutaneous lesions. The most striking features of the reported case were the onset of the eruption in an adult patient and the clinical appearance of the lesions, resembling lichen planus.

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) can involve any organ system in the body. Extrapulmonary involvement can occur in isolation or along with a pulmonary focus as in the case of patients with disseminated tuberculosis. Tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. TBM a medical emergency, is still a major cause of serious illness in many parts of the world. TBM remains difficult to diagnose, and it is usually due to hematogenous dissemination of the tubercle bacillus. The exact incidence and prevalence are not known. The clinical spectrum is broad and may be non-specific making early diagnosis difficult. Improved outcome requires early recognition and treatment of these conditions. Clinical features included fever for more than 7 days, headache, or neck stiffness. While TBM is a disease of childhood, tuberculomas and spinal tuberculosis are invariably an adult manifestation. In HIV infection, TB is often atypical in presentation, frequently causing extrapulmonary disease, and patients have a high incidence of TBM. Clinical response to antituberculous therapy in all forms of neurotuberculosis is excellent if the diagnosis is made early before irreversible neurological deficit is established. Diagnosis is based on the characteristic clinical picture, neuroimaging abnormalities, cerebrospinal fluid changes and the response to anti-tuberculosis drugs. Diagnosis is best made with lumbar puncture and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Suspect TBM if there is a CSF leucocytosis (predominantly lymphocytes), the CSF protein is raised, and the CSF plasma glucose is <50%. Rapid techniques based on nucleic acid amplification such as PCR are more sensitive and specific as they attempt to detect specific DNA sequences of the organism. The hallmark pathological processes are meningeal inflammation, basal exudates, vasculitis and hydrocephalus. Treatment delay is strongly associated with death and empirical anti-tuberculosis therapy should be started promptly in all patients in whom the diagnosis of TBM is suspected. Corticosteroids reduce the number of deaths. Development of an effective vaccine against tuberculosis hinges on an improved understanding of the human immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis poses a serious threat to the control of this pathogen, and the development of drugs that are active against the resistant strains is vital. Further research into the epidemiology, immune mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of TBM is urgently needed.},

abstract={Background: Direct smear examination with Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is cheap and easy to use, but its low sensitivity is a major drawback, particularly in HIV seropositive patients. As such, new tools for laboratory diagnosis are urgently needed to improve the case detection rate, especially in regions with a high prevalence of TB and HIV.Objective: To evaluate the performance of two in house PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): PCR dot-blot methodology (PCR dot-blot) and PCR agarose gel electrophoresis (PCR-AG) for the diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) in HIV seropositive and HIV seronegative patients.Methods: A prospective study was conducted (from May 2003 to May 2004) in a TB/HIV reference hospital. Sputum specimens from 277 PTB suspects were tested by Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear, Culture and in house PCR assays (PCR dot-blot and PCR-AG) and their performances evaluated. Positive cultures combined with the definition of clinical pulmonary TB were employed as the gold standard.Results: The overall prevalence of PTB was 46% (128/277); in HIV+, prevalence was 54.0% (40/74). The sensitivity and specificity of PCR dot-blot were 74% (CI 95%; 66.1%-81.2%) and 85% (CI 95%; 78.8%-90.3%); and of PCR-AG were 43% (CI 95%; 34.5%-51.6%) and 76% (CI 95%; 69.2%-82.8%), respectively. For HIV seropositive and HIV seronegative samples, sensitivities of PCR dot-blot (72% vs 75%; p = 0.46) and PCR-AG (42% vs 43%; p = 0.54) were similar. Among HIV seronegative patients and PTB suspects, ROC analysis presented the following values for the AFB smear (0.837), Culture (0.926), PCR dot-blot (0.801) and PCR-AG (0.599). In HIV seropositive patients, these area values were (0.713), (0.900), (0.789) and (0.595), respectively.Conclusion: Results of this study demonstrate that the in house PCR dot blot may be an improvement for ruling out PTB diagnosis in PTB suspects assisted at hospitals with a high prevalence of TB/HIV. © 2011 Scherer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and its variations, such as the nested-PCR, have been described as promising techniques for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). With the aim of evaluating the usefulness of a nested-PCR method on samples of blood and urine of patients suspected of tuberculosis we analyzed 192 clinical samples, using as a molecular target the insertion element IS6110 specific of M. tuberculosis genome. Nested-PCR method showed higher sensitivity in patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis (47.8% and 52% in blood and urine) when compared to patients with the pulmonary form of the disease (sensitivity of 29% and 26.9% in blood and urine), regardless of the type of biological sample used. The nested-PCR is a rapid technique that, even if not showing a good sensitivity, should be considered as a helpful tool especially in the extrapulmonary cases or in cases where confirmatory diagnosis is quite difficult to be achieved by routine methods. The performance of PCR-based techniques should be considered and tested in future works on other types of biological specimens besides sputum, like blood and urine, readily obtainable in most cases. The improving of M. tuberculosis nested-PCR detection in TB affected patients will give the possibility of an earlier detection of bacilli thus interrupting the transmission chain of the disease.},

abstract={Accurate diagnosis in osteoarticular tuberculosis poses a difficulty due to deep inaccessible lesions, paucibacillary state, and initiation of empirical ATT in most of the cases. Diagnosis of osteoarticular TB evolved from clinicoradiological to serodiagnosis to detection of DNA/RNA of MTB origin. Newer modalities which aid in early diagnosis and treatment go a long way in management of osteoarticular TB by significantly decreasing morbidity. Subjecting all cases to panel of investigations including AFB staining, AFB culture/sensitivity, PCR, and histopathology on obtaining tissue have been proved more efficacious than resorting to single test. In particular serology alone is not diagnostic. High sensitivity and specificity of PCR and histopathology are found to be most useful diagnostic modalities in studies. Thus gold standard remains to be tissue diagnosis. © 2011 Indian Rheumatology Association.},

abstract={Central nervous system tuberculosis (TB) is the most devastating manifestation of TB. It is a challenge for clinicians because of the difficulty in making an early diagnosis and the severe consequences of delayed treatment. The aim of this report is to point out the relation between migration and TB based on a 14-year-old child with tuberculous meningoencephalitis (TBM) of an immigrant family. Migration, crowded living conditions and positive family history contribute to the severe course of TB as TBM and miliary TB forms. TB control may prevent these severe manifestations of the disease among immigrants. Prompt diagnosis with helpful early diagnostic tools like polymerase chain reaction in TBM is crucial due to the high mortality and morbidity.},

abstract={Purpose: Uveitis is a major visual impairment disease affecting parts or the entire uveal tract and occasionally the sclera, the cornea or the optic nerve. The disease is a major cause of ocular morbidity and blindness in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. In this work we analyzed the sensitivity and specificity of realtime PCR to detect the etiological agent from blood, plasma, vitreous and aqueous humor and compared with the diagnostic hypothesis. Methods: Twenty-seven patients (13 male) were studied and Real-time PCR method was used for the detection of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and Toxoplasma gondii (Toxo) in the aqueous humor as well as in the vitreous, blood and plasma. Results: Our results showed the presence of Toxo, CMV, VZV or HSV-2 in 19.2% of aqueous humor samples, and in 30% of vitreous humor samples. In plasma and blood samples, only CMV was detected (11.1% and 3.7%, respectively). Conclusion: Real-time PCR was able to detect and to confirm diagnostic hypothesis in uveitis. Our data also confirms that vitreous humor is the best source for molecular diagnosis of infectious uveitis but indicates aqueous humor samples that are easier to obtain may also be appropriate to be tested by Real-time PCR.},

We present the case of a Somali man born in the United Kingdom who presented with a nonhealing ulcer on the right hand of 10 years' duration. The patient was diagnosed with tuberculosis verrucosa cutis based on clinical suspicion, which was confirmed by several investigations including strongly positive results of a Mantoux test, IFN-γ release assay, typical histology on skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis positive for mycobacterial DNA. Treatment with quadruple antituberculous therapy produced rapid resolution of the ulcer. This unusual condition often is overlooked in the differential diagnosis of nonhealing ulcers, yet it has an excellent prognosis with treatment. A high index of suspicion is required. © Cutis 2011.},

abstract={Background: HIV infection is a major risk factor for death in childhood pneumonia in HIV-endemic regions. Improved case management and preventive strategies require better understanding of the impact of HIV on causes, clinical presentation, and outcome. Methods: A prospective, clinical descriptive study of Malawian infants and children with severe pneumonia included blood culture and nasopharyngeal aspiration for diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP). A select group with consolidation on chest radiograph, and without severe hypoxia or hyperinflation, also had lung aspirate taken for culture and identification of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: There were 327 study patients with a median age of 11 months (range, 2 months-14 years). HIV prevalence was 51%. There were 58 cases of confirmed bacterial pneumonia, of which the most common bacterial isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium. Of the 54 lung aspirates, only 2 were positive on culture but 27 were positive for bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid by PCR. PcP was confirmed in 16 patients, and was associated with young age, severe hypoxia, HIV infection, and a very poor outcome. The overall case-fatality rate was 10% despite presumptive therapy for PcP and routine broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment appropriate for local antimicrobial susceptibility data. Most of the deaths occurred in infants of 2 to 6 months of age and PcP was associated with 57% of these deaths. Conclusions: PcP is a major barrier in reducing the case-fatality rate of severe pneumonia in infants of HIV-endemic communities. The use of PCR on lung aspirate specimens greatly increased the diagnostic yield. © 2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={STUDY DESIGN.: Case report. OBJECTIVE.: To illustrate the usefulness of broad-range bacterial polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing in osteoarticular infections by Capnocytophaga canimorsus. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: C. canimorsus is a Gram-negative bacillus that was first identified in 1976. It is a normal inhabitant of the oral mucosa of dogs (26%) and cats (15%). The main clinical patterns are septicemia, which may cause fatal septic shock (in 30% of cases) but arthritis and discitis are possible. C. canimorsus is susceptible to many antimicrobials including β-lactam antibiotics. METHODS.: About a case report of 54-year-old man transferred to our institution for discitis, we discuss about PCR for C. canimorsus discitis diagnosis. RESULTS.: At admission, the only abnormal physical finding was global pain and stiffness of the lumbar spine. Radiographs of the lumbar spine and pelvis showed lumbar spondylosis, degenerative disc disease, and previously known degenerative facet joint disease. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated L3-L4 discitis with damage to both vertebrae and adjacent discs. Findings were negative from blood and urine cultures, serological tests for the HIV and brucellosis, and sputum tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A percutaneous biopsy of the L3-L4 disc was performed but the bacteriological studies recovered no organisms. A second needle biopsy was performed for broad-range 16S rDNA PCR testing, which identified C. canimorsus. CONCLUSION.: Broad-range PCR provided the microbiological diagnosis of culture-negative discitis in our patient. Broad-range PCR should be considered in patients with culture-negative osteoarticular infections. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Background: To determine the therapeutic and diagnostic value of vitreoretinal surgery in various types of severe viral retinitis and endogenous endophthalmitis. Material/Methods: Pars plana vitrectomy with silicon-oil tamponade was performed on 12 eyes (12 patients) with severe viral retinitis and endogenous endophthalmitis. The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years (range, 18-56 years). Investigations consisted of chest radiography, RT 23, serology (for toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and human immunodeficiency virus), and routine blood tests and urinalysis. Examination of vitreous samples consisted of polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and cultures for fungi and bacteria. The results were analyzed 7 days and 6 months after surgery. Results: Analysis of vitreous samples showed cytomegalovirus in 3 patients, herpes simplex virus in 2, tuberculosis in 2, and Candida albicans in 5. All patients had improvement in visual acuity and severity of clinical signs seven days after surgery and in 10 cases after long-term follow-up. Final visual acuity was compromised by chronic macular edema, postinflammatory macular scarring, optic atrophy, subcapsular cataract formation, and capsular opacification after cataract surgery. Conclusions: Modern laboratory tests are useful for quick and accurate diagnosis of atypical cases of severe infectious posterior uveitis. Early pars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil tamponade is valuable in diagnosing and treating severe infectious posterior uveitis and endophthalmitis. © Med Sci Monit, 2010.},

abstract={Background:Since the co-infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and HIV is recognized as a lethal combination, there is need for a reliable diagnostic test that can be conducted on a readily available specimen such as peripheral blood to periodically screen HIV-infected individuals for MTB at an early stage. Methods:A study was designed to assess the diagnostic value of PCR targeted to IS 1081 in peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals because of ease of obtaining periodic samples. A cohort of 129 individuals was recruited for this purpose. It contained of adult, non-pregnant HIV sero-positive as well as HIV sero-negative individuals who were naïve to anti-Koch's treatment at two teaching hospitals in Mumbai. Results: The cohort of 129 individuals was categorized into 5 groups based on their clinical TB and HIV status. The mean CD4 count for TB+HIV+(Groups 1,2,3) ranged between 381 and 525 cells/cmm suggesting early to moderate immune suppression.TB PCR assay was compared with the 'gold' standard, namely the LJ culture in each of the 5 groups. Overall, the sensitivity of PCR was 83.3% and specificity was 97.1%. PCR+ LJ-were subjected to sequential TB PCR tests at intervals of two weeks after initiation of AKT.TB PCR+ patients converted to TB PCR negative between 6-8 weeks. Conclusions: The study established that PCR targeted to IS 1081 is a valuable test for early diagnosis of TB from peripheral blood at an early point of TB activation when most patients (>85%) did not produce other traditional specimens such as the sputum and/or pleural fluid. © Internet Scientific Publications, LLC., 1996 to 2010.},

abstract={A modification of a highly practical human interferon-gamma release assay for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold (In-Tube Method) (QFG-IT) assay, was evaluated for diagnosing natural mycobacterial infection in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). All animals in a captive colony were tested using the QFG-IT and tuberculin skin test (TST). Animals testing positive to these tests were euthanised and necropsied. Selected tissues were processed for histopathology and mycobacterial culture, and positive cultures were speciated by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 16S rRNA gene PCR sequencing techniques. M. tuberculosis was cultured from a TST-positive/QFG-IT-positive animal which showed gross pulmonary pathology typical of TB. Additionally, Mycobacterium kansasii was cultured from a TST-negative/QFG-IT-positive animal which had no pathological or histopathological signs of mycobacterial infection. The detection of M. kansasii infection in a QFG-IT-positive animal which showed no evidence of disease indicates that this test might be a highly sensitive tool for the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection in rhesus macaques. However, these findings highlight the limitations of the QFG-IT to specifically detect infection by the pathogens M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective - To investigate the pathogenesis and transmission of elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV1) by analyzing various elephant fluid samples with a novel EEHV1-specific real-time PCR assay. Animals - 5 apparently healthy captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) from the same herd. Procedures - A real-time PCR assay was developed that specifically detects EEHV1. The assay was used to evaluate paired whole blood and trunk-wash samples obtained from the 5 elephants during a 15-week period. Deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing and viral gene subtyping analysis were performed on trunk-wash DNA preparations that had positive results for EEHV1. Viral gene subtypes were compared with those associated with past fatal cases of herpesvirus-associated disease within the herd. Results - The PCR assay detected viral DNA to a level of 1,200 copies/mL of whole blood. It was used to detect EEHV1 in trunk secretions of 3 of the 5 elephants surveyed during the 15-week period. Viral gene subtyping analysis identified 2 distinct elephant herpesviruses, 1 of which was identical to the virus associated with a previous fatal case of herpesvirus-associated disease within the herd. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - EEHV1 was shed in the trunk secretions of healthy Asian elephants. Trunk secretions may provide a mode of transmission for this virus. Results of this study may be useful for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of EEHV1-associated disease and the overall management of captive elephant populations.},

abstract={Purpose: Tuberculosis poses a serious health problem in resource-poor settings such as India. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is presently seen as a promising alternative to conventional smear microscopy and culture techniques. Undiagnosed fever is a condition where the aetiology could include tuberculosis in a significant percentage. This paper evaluates a nested PCR (nPCR) using Hotstar Taq for the detection of M. tuberculosis in patients with febrile illness using insertion element, IS6110 as a target. Material and Methods: A total of 355 samples (301 HIV status unknown and 54 HIV seropositives) from patients primarily with febrile illness were tested for the presence of M. tuberculosis. Blood culture was done in a commercial automated blood culture system and nPCR in DNA extracts from buffy coat samples. Hotstar Taq polymerase was used to enhance the sensitivity of nPCR and the lower limit of detection was determined by using cloned plasmid. Results: Among the patients tested, 2% were positive by automated culture system and 6.8% of patients were positive by nPCR. Majority of the positives were from HIV seropositive individuals. The sensitivity of the nPCR was 100% and the specificity was 95.1%. The lower limit of detection was less than 1 genome copy per microlitre. Among the nPCR positives, patients from rural community were significantly higher than from the peri-urban community. Conclusions: The nPCR had a high sensitivity and specificity on buffy coat samples using Hotstar Taq polymerase in the reaction mix. Thus the technique is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of tuberculosis.},

abstract={Background: Febrile encephalopathy, defined as fever, seizures and/or altered consciousness, is a common presentation in children in tropical developing countries. Outcomes range from complete recovery through varying degrees of neurological disability which slowly resolve or remain permanent to death from either the acute illness or complications. Whilst bacterial meningitis accounts for a proportion of children affected, the aetiology in many remains unclear but includes malaria and probably viral encephalitis. Aim: To understand the aetiology, presentation and outcome of febrile encephalopathy in children in Papua New Guinea. Methods: Children aged between 1 month and 12 years presenting to Port Moresby General Hospital with febrile encephalopathy were studied prospectively. A detailed history and examination and the following laboratory investigations were undertaken as appropriate: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microscopy and bacterial culture, gram stain, measurement of protein and glucose and latex agglutination testing for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitides; Ziehl-Neelsen staining and india ink examination on selected samples; IgM for Japanese encephalitis, dengue, rubella and measles; PCR testing and mycobacterial culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Blood was tested for flavivirus, measles and rubella IgM and IgG. Results: 149 children were enrolled in the study. 129 had a lumbar puncture and CSF examination; 66 had a normal CSF white cell count. A clinical or laboratory-based diagnosis was possible for 140 children, but a definite pathogen was identifiable for only 55 (37%). The diagnoses included bacterial meningitis in 33 (S. pneumonia 16, H. influenza 13 and N. meningitides 4), tuberculous meningitis (5), probable tuberculous meningitis (18), malaria (10), cryptococcal meningitis (1), flavivirus encephalitis (5), rubella encephalitis (1), hepatic encephalopathy (1) and HIV encephalopathy (1). There were 28 cases of meningitis of unspecified aetiology. Of the five children with IgM-confirmed flavivirus encephalitis, one had dengue serotype 1 and two had Japanese encephalitis. Twenty-five children (including three of the five children with CSF flavivirus IgM) had serological IgG evidence of previous flavivirus infection. A history of multiple convulsions, the presence of neck stiffness and use of the Glasgow coma score (GCS) and TB score chart helped to identify children with bacterial meningitis and an adverse outcome and those with febrile convulsions. Conclusion: The study confirms the importance of S. pneumonia and H. influenza as major causes of febrile encephalopathy in children in Papua New Guinea. Flaviviruses including Japanese encephalitis are a cause of the febrile encephalopathy syndrome, as is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All children with febrile encephalopathy should have their GCS and TB scores recorded and should be examined for neck stiffness, and a history of the frequency of convulsions should be recorded. These basic clinical data can help to discriminate aetiology, to guide treatment and monitoring and to identify the children at highest risk of adverse outcome. © W. S. Maney & Son Ltd 2010.},

abstract={Arthropod-borne viral infections have recently gained considerable attention and importance as re-emerging infections in a global scale. West Nile Virus (WNV), a member of Flaviviridae, is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus that is usually transmitted to humans by the bite of Culicine mosquitoes. Although the majority of the human infections are asymptomatic, WNV may also cause febrile and neuro-invasive diseases. Seroprevalence data from Turkey indicate that WNV activity is present in Central Anatolia. In this study performed at Hacettepe University Hospital, paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 87 adult patients with the preliminary diagnosis of aseptic meningitis/encephalitis of unknown etiology were evaluated retrospectively to identify WNV-related syndromes. Bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures yielded negative results and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Herpes simplex virus nucleic acid tests were also negative for the selected patients. Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)s and indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT)s were employed for WNV IgM and IgG antibody detection (Anti-WNV Virus IgG/IgM EUSA, Anti-WNV Virus IgG/IgM IIFT; Euroimmun, Germany). Additional ELISA/IIFT assays were further performed for WNV antibody reactive samples to identify cross-reactions and/or infections with other flaviviruses and phleboviruses. All WNV antibody positive samples were also evaluated by a WNV real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. WNV IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in %9.2 (8/87) and 3.4% (3/87) of the serum samples, respectively. All IgG reactive samples were negative for IgM. All sera with WNV antibody reactivity (n= 11) and the corresponding CSF samples were negative for viral RNA via RT-PCR. In 5 of the 8 WNV IgM positive subjects, sandfly fever virus IgM antibodies were detected, which was also accompanied by Dengue virus IgM positivity in one sample. In another case, intrathecal antibody synthesis against measles virus was demonstrated. Two cases (2/87; 2.3%) with WNV IgM positivity as the only serologic marker were identified as probable WNV infections and clinical features were discussed. In conclusion, in order to fully understand the impact of WNV and/or other flavivirus infections in Turkey, epidemiology and ecological features of these agents need to established.},

abstract={Control of bovine tuberculosis (TB) is currently based on slaughter of cattle deemed positive on the basis of tuberculin testing; although the test has been broadly used for several years, there are some disadvantages such as the need for holding animals for 72 h. Besides it, test can lack both sensitivity and specificity depending on the interpretation and the site of the PPD inoculation. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the use of the Gamma-Interferon (IFN) assay as a confirmatory test in Brazil. A Comparative Intradermal Tuberculin Test (CITT) was performed in 50 cows from a dairy herd known to be infected with TB. Blood samples for IFN testing were collected concurrent with the CITT, as well as seven and 21 days later. At 30 days after the CITT, all cattle deemed reactive to this test were slaughtered and samples were processed by both bacteriological culture and PCR. The sensitivity of IFN as a diagnostic tool was 91.4%, whereas specificity was 86.7%. When applied seven or 21 days after injection of PPD, sensitivity was 74.3 and 71.4%, respectively, whereas specificity was 86.7 and 80%. There was no significant difference between the reliability of the IFN assay and the other standards, on all three days of sampling. Therefore, we concluded that the IFN assay could be effectively used as a confirmatory test seven or 21 days after injection of PPD. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a benzyl-alcohol g uanidine hydrochloride (DNA extraction) method (GuHClM) on blood samples. DESIGN: GuHClM was evaluated in quantitatively spiked blood samples with M. tuberculosis. We assessed the insertion sequence (IS) 6110 region of M. tuberculosis to evaluate the efficacy of the method. The method was also applied on 102 clinical samples of suspected tuberculosis (TB) individuals and compared with smear microscopy of sputum specimens and the results of cultures. RESULTS: This method reproducibly detected as low as 4-6 bacilli. Of 102 clinical samples, 84 were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative, while 18 were HIV-positive. Among the HIV-negative individuals, 58.3% were TB-positive using PCR, while respectively 47.6% and 45.2% were sputum- and culture-positive. Among the HIV-positive individuals, 55.6% were PCR-positive, whereas only 38.9% were sputum-positive and 50% were culture-positive. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the identification of mycobacteria by PCR using GuHClM is very sensitive and therefore may have wide utility in the diagnosis of TB. © 2010 The Union.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is critical for TB control, and difficult in patients with smear-negative sputum. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to evaluate the usefulness of clinical findings, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), interferon-gamma-releasing assay (IGRA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of sputum in the diagnosis of smear-negative PTB. Methods: From June 2006 to September 2008, 178 patients with suspected PTB on the basis of clinical and radiological findings visited our institute. After excluding smear-positive cases (n = 77) and cases with an inconclusive diagnosis (n = 17), we studied 84 patients. Their clinical records, HRCT, sputum TB-PCR assay and IGRA results were retrospectively evaluated. A QuantiFeron-TB Gold (QFT-G; Cellestis Ltd., Carnegie, Vic., Australia) assay was used for the IGRA. RESULTS: Active PTB was diagnosed in 40 (48%) of 84 patients; lack of sputum and young age were significantly associated with an increased risk of PTB. The sensitivities of sputum PCR assay, IGRA, and HRCT were 43.2, 84.4 and 80.0%, respectively, and the specificities were 97.7, 82.9 and 70.5%, respectively. Among the 38 patients suspected of having PTB based on HRCT, 24 patients showed positive results on the IGRA, and 23 of these were diagnosed with active PTB. Among the 35 patients suggested not to have TB based on HRCT, 25 showed negative results on the IGRA, and 23 (92%) of these were diagnosed as not to have TB. CONCLUSION: The combined results of HRCT and the IGRA could help decision-making for early initiation of treatment in smear-negative patients. Copyright 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract={Justification: Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) has focused on adults with smear positivity - a tool not so well used in children with tuberculosis. There is a need to redefine standardization of diagnosis and management protocols for childhood tuberculosis. Process: Indian Academy of Pediatrics constituted a Working Group to develop consensus statement on childhood tuberculosis (TB). Members of the Group were given individual responsibilities to review the existing literature on different aspects of the childhood TB. The group deliberated and developed a consensus which was circulated to all the members for review. Efforts were made to ensure that the recommendations are standardized. Objectives: To produce recommendations and standard protocols for reasonably accurate diagnosis and rational treatment of tuberculosis in children. Recommendations: Fever and / or cough > 2 weeks with loss of weight and recent contact with infectious case should arouse suspicion of TB. Chest X-ray and trial with broad-spectrum antibiotic for 7-10 days is justified. In case of clinical and radiological non-response, Mantoux test and sputum or gastric aspirate for AFB is recommended. If AFB is positive, diagnosis is confirmed. If AFB is negative but chest X-ray is suggestive and Mantoux test is positive, it is a probable case and if these tests are negative, alternate diagnosis must be sought and referral made to an expert. Ideally it is recommended to use 1TU of PPD for Mantoux test but 2 or 5 TU may be acceptable (but less preferred). Cut-off point of 10 mms for natural infection may be used for test done with 1, 2 or 5 TU. There is no linear relation of reaction to tuberculin strength and so no more than 5 TU should be used. BCG test is not recommended. Diagnosis must not be made without an attempt to look for AFB in gastric aspirate or sputum, as it is possible to get AFB even in primary complex. Elisa and PCR tests for TB are not recommended. There is no place for trial of anti-tubercular therapy. Lymphnode enlargement >2 cm with or without typical findings suggestive of TB and failure of antibiotic response demands FNAC for histopathology and bacteriology. Clinical suspicion of tubercular meningitis (TBM) should be confirmed by CSF examination and CT scan though none of these investigations are confirmatory and hence should not be considered in isolation. CSF tests for TB antibody and PCR are not recommended for routine use. Diagnosis of abdominal TB is made on circumstantial evidence and there are no standard guidelines. For treatment, disease is divided into three categories. The Category I and III are recommended for different types of new cases i.e. those who have received treatment for not more than 4 weeks. Category III includes primary pulmonary complex, one site peripheral lympha-denitis and pleural effusion, while all other forms of TB are included in Category I, that corresponds to smear positive TB in adults. This is because AFB is often found in many Category I disease in children. Category II includes defaulters, relapses and failure cases irrespective of the site of disease. Standard protocol is followed for each of these categories. Intermittent thrice weekly therapy with higher dose has been found to be equally effective as daily therapy and so is recommended in DOTS - Direct Observed Therapy Short term. Compliance of treatment must be ensured. Repeat chest X-ray is ideal at the end of therapy. Liver function tests are not routinely recommended. Recommendations are also made for special situations such as MDRTB, TB and HIV and neonate born to mother suffering from TB.},

abstract={Objective: This study was conducted in order to determine the etiological factors, morbidity, case fatality rate and cost of meningitis/meningoencephalitis cases followed in our clinic and to compare our data with national and international ones. Material and Methods: Fifty-one meningitis/meningoencephalitis cases followed in our clinic between April 2003 and May 2008 were evaluated retrospectively. Demographic characteristics and clinical data of the patients were obtained from the records. Diagnosis of meningitis/meningoencephalitis depended on cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) and radiological findings in the presence of clinical findings. Results: Among 51 patients, 29 (56.9%) were diagnosed as acute bacterial meningitis, 12 (23.5%) as viral meningoencephalitis and 10 (19.6%) as tuberculosis meningitis. Classical findings of meningitis such as fever, neck stiffness and change in conciuosness were present in 69% of the cases with acute bacterial meningitis, in 50% of the ones with viral meningitis, and in 40% of the ones with tuberculosis meningitis. Blood white blood cell count was 19.308/mm3 in acute bacterial meningitis, 10.389/mm3 in viral meningitis, and 9980/mm3 in tuberculosis meningitis. Increased blood white blood cell count was statistically significant in acute bacterial meningitis (p&lt; 0.05). CSF white blood cell count was 4254.0/mm3 in acute bacterial meningitis, 282.5/mm3 in viral meningitis, and 365/ mm3 in tuberculosis meningitis. Causative pathogen was isolated in 15 (51.7%) of the 29 cases with acute bacterial meningitis; it was Streptococcus pneumoniae in 10 (34.4%), Listeria monocytogenes in 3 (10.34%), Staphylococcus aureus in 1 (3.4%), and Streptococcus pyogenes in one (3.4%) patient. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in CSF culture in 2 (20%) of the 10 patients with tuberculosis meningitis. CSF was positive for HSV-DNA with PCR in two of 12 patients with viral meningoencephalitis. Mean period of hospitalization was 17.76 days in patients with community acquired meningitis/meningoencephalitis; this period was significantly longer in the tuberculosis meningitis cases (p&lt; 0.05). Mean cost of hospitalization and medication was 4860.95 USD for the cases with community acquired meningitis/meningoencephalitis. No mortality was seen in the cases with viral meningoencephalitis, whereas case fatality rate was 37.9% (11/29) in acute bacterial meningitis and 10% (1/10) in tuberculosis meningitis. Three cases with viral meningoencephalitis, two cases with acute bacterial meningitis and two cases with tuberculosis meningitis healed with sequelae. Conclusion: Despite developments in medicine, cases with meningitis/meningoencephalitis require prolonged hospitalization, have high fatality rate and cost, and the disease leads to serious sequelae. © 2010 by Türkiye Klinikleri.},

abstract={Background: The Australian Government's Pacific Malaria Initiative (PacMI) is supporting the National Malaria Program in both Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, complementing assistance from the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). Two remote island groups - Tafea Province, Vanuatu and Temotu Province, Solomon Islands have been selected by the governments of both countries as possible malaria elimination areas. To provide information on the prevalence and distribution of the disease within these island groups, malariometric surveys were conducted during the wet seasons of 2008. Methods: In Tafea Province, a school-based survey was conducted which included the 2-12 y age group, while in Temotu a village based all-ages survey was conducted. An effort was made to sample villages or schools from a wide an area as possible on all islands. Diagnosis was initially based on Giemsa stained blood slides followed by molecular analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: In Tafea Province, 73% (5238/7150) of children (2-12 y) were surveyed and in Temotu Province, in the all-ages survey, 50.2% (8742/17410) of the provincial population participated in the survey. In both Vanuatu and Solomon Islands malariometric surveys of their southern-most islands in 2008 showed relatively low over-all malaria parasite prevalence (2 to 3%). Other features of malaria in these island groups were low parasitaemia, low gametocyte carriage rates, low spleen rates, low malaria associated morbidity, a high incidence of asymptomatic infections, and a predominance of Plasmodium vivax over Plasmodium falciparum. Conclusion: For various reasons malaria rates are declining in these provinces providing a favourable situation for local malaria elimination. This will be advanced using mass distribution of bed nets and selective indoor residual spraying, the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin combination therapy, and intensive case detection and surveillance. It is as yet uncertain whether malaria parasites can themselves be sustainably eliminated from entire Melanesian islands, where they have previously been endemic. Key issues on the road to malaria elimination will be continued community involvement, improved field diagnostic methods and elimination of residual P. vivax parasites from the liver of asymptomatic persons. © 2010 Shanks and The Pacific Malaria Initiative Survey Group (PMISG) on behalf of the Ministries of Health of Vanuatu and Solomon Islands; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The tuberculin tests are widely used for diagnosis and control of tuberculosis (TB) in humans and animals. It is characterized by a complex mixture of mycobacteria antigens able to induce hypersensitivity reactions even in animals infected with mycobacteria other than M. bovis, for purposes of cross-reactivity. The preparation of purified protein derivative (PPD) is similar to the tuberculin, unlike the concentration of proteins which are separated by precipitation with chemical agents and not by increasing its specific heat. The first results obtained with the serological tests for diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis show that there is a great antigenic cross-reactivity between mycobacterias species so it requires more specific antigens. It implemented a cattle IFN-γ test and ELISA-TBC to detect anti M. bovis activity. The immunoassay test for IFN-γ used in conjunction with the cropping system of whole blood resulted in an essay in vitro rapid and sensitive to detect the reactivity of the cell-mediated immunity to M. bovis in livestock infected. Comparative test of the tuberculina, test of Gamma Interferon (INF-γ) and a test ELISA-TBC, soon was taken to slaughter house to take linfoides weave samples and nodules, to which the test of chain reaction of Polimerasa was applied to them, to bacteriological culture and (PCR), for the identification from the pathogen. From these tests the patterns of immune response settled down and the obtained results of the different tests were compared to establish sensitivity and specificity using with t gold standard, the data collected in culture and PCR. The results were analyzed using the statistical method of analysis of variance for nonparametric tests. The PPD Bpositive, are not the same reacting to IFN-γ or at ELISA-TBC. Although its sensitivity is low, it shows greater specificity and consistency as the rest of the tests used.},

abstract={Bloody stools, diarrhea and perianal abscesses were observed from the age of two months infant. The boy received a BCG vaccination at the age of four months. The patient was diagnosed as having Crohn's disease at the age of six months by intestinal endoscopy. Based on the diagnosis, he was treated with nutrition therapy, salazosulfapyridine, and prednisolone. Fever of unknown origin occurred two months after he had taken azathioprine at the age of two years and two months. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected from a gastric aspirate, and he was diagnosed as having disseminated BCG infection by means of the multiplex PCR method. Chest CT showed miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs on admission. Physical examination revealed enlarged lymphnodes, which were palpable around the neck and groin, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory data were within normal ranges except a slightly increased peripheral white blood cell and serum CRP level. He was treated with rifampicin (15 mg/kg/day), isoniazid (15 mg/kg/day) for 12 months, and streptomycin (25 mg/kg/day) for two months. He became afebrile a week after starting the treatment, and the miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs had disappeared by 5 months after starting the treatment. An abnormality of the NEMO gene, which is the gene responsible for ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency, was identified at the age of three years. It is assumed that an abnormality of the NEMO gene caused a latent BCG infection over a period of one year and ten months, and immunosuppressive medicine (azathioprine) induced a disseminated BCG infection. This case report supports that anti-tuberculosis medicine should be given to prevent disseminated BCG infection if an infant who receive immunosuppressive therapy is found to have an immune deficiency characterized by a mycobacterium infection after BCG vaccination.},

abstract={Background. A 55-year-old, HLA-B27-positive Finnish woman presented with migratory, sterile polyarthritis. Investigations. Physical examination, chest radiography, serologic testing, microscopy, M. tuberculosis-specific interferon γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, smear and culture of synovial fluid for acid-fast bacilli, and PCR. Diagnosis. The patient's assayed blood and synovial fluid lymphocytes were reactive, and the numbers of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells, as determined by ELISPOT, were twofold to sixfold higher in synovial fluid than in blood. Cultures for acid-fast bacilli remained negative, while PCR specific for DNA of the M. tuberculosis complex was positive in synovial fluid cells. These results suggested that the patient had either active or latent M. tuberculosis infection. This finding, coupled with the presence of polyarthritis, led to a diagnosis of Poncet disease. Management. Standard antituberculous therapy consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide was given for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 4 months. Inflamed joints were treated with methylprednisolone injections. The polyarthritis resolved within 4 months of initiating antituberculous therapy.},

abstract={Rationale: The rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is difficult when acid fast bacilli (AFB) cannot be detected in sputum smears. Objectives: Following a proof of principle study, we examined in routine clinical practice whether individuals with sputum AFB smear-negative TB can be discriminated from those with latent TB infection by local immunodiagnosis with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. Methods: Subjects suspected of having active TB who were unable to produce sputum or with AFB-negative sputum smears were prospectively enrolled at Tuberculosis Network European Trialsgroup centers in Europe. ELISpot with early-secretory-antigenic- target-6 and culture-filtrate-protein-10 peptides was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bronchoalveolar lavage mononuclear cells (BALMCs). M. tuberculosis-specific nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) was performed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Measurements and Main Results: Seventy-one of 347 (20.4%) patients had active TB. Out of 276 patients who had an alternative diagnosis, 127 (46.0%) were considered to be latently infected with M. tuberculosis by a positive PBMC ELISpot result. The sensitivity and specificity of BALMC ELISpot for the diagnosis of active pulmonary TB were 91 and 80%, respectively. The BALMC ELISpot (diagnostic odds ratio [OR], 40.4) was superior to PBMC ELISpot (OR, 10.0), tuberculin skin test (OR, 7.8), and M. tuberculosis specific NAAT (OR, 12.4) to diagnose sputum AFB smear-negative TB. In contrast to PBMC ELISpot and tuberculin skin test, the BALMC ELISpot was not influenced by previous history of TB. Conclusions: Bronchoalveolar lavage ELISpot is an important advancement to rapidly distinguish sputum AFB smear-negative TB from latent TB infection in routine clinical practice.},

abstract={In June 2008 a 23-year-old immunocompetent came to our observation, without fever and with an occasional cough for 2 months, who showed two chest X-rays and a CT, performed respectively 60, 40 and 20 days earlier, that pointed to a small lobitis at the right lung base. The patient had already undergone several antibiotic therapies that had not changed the X-graphic framework. On presentation, routine blood tests and cultural examinations of sputum were carried out to detect common germs, fungi and TB bacteria (microscopic observation, cultivation and PCR), and a new antibiotic therapy (piperacillin/tazobactam) was started. Since the radiological picture appeared unchanged after 10 days of therapy and the examinations (microscopic observation and PCR) were negative, bronchoscopy with bacteriological evaluation of BAL was performed, which was positive to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and then tubercular lobitis was diagnosed. Therefore a specific therapy - rifampin (RMP), isoniazid (INH), etambutol (EMB), pyrazinamid (PZA) - was started and changed after 10 days due to the growth of mycobacteria resistant to INH and EMB on examination of sputum. Consequently, the early use of PCR on BAL allows, in skilled hands, small aspecific lobitis to be diagnosed more rapidly than using cultural examination of sputum.},

abstract={In order to establish a rapid and stable method for diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and minimize the side effects of delayed diagnosis on patients and health system, a cross sectional study was carried out. Since, the infection rate with this bacteria increasing and one of the reasons for this increase is long process of laboratory identification, therefore establishing new diagnosis methods could decrease disease rate. To achieve this aim, collected sputum and blood specimens from 50 patients with clinical suspicion of pulmonary tuberculosis were studied with both traditional, acid-fast stain (AFB) and culture method compare to Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) (IgG and IgM) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods. The sensitivity and specificity of all methods were determined by using the PCR results as the gold standard. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of AFB were 17.64, 100,100 and 70.12%. These values for culture method was 29.41, 100, 100 and 73.33% and for IgG antibody were 66.7, 81.81, 64.7 and 81.81% and IgM antibody were 70.58, 90.9, 80 and 85.71%, respectively. It was concluded that maximum sensitivity and specificity can be achieved by PCR method. © 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract={Background: Current tools for the diagnosis of tuberculosis pleural effusions are sub-optimal. Data about the value of new diagnostic technologies are limited, particularly, in high burden settings. Preliminary case control studies have identified IFN-γ-inducible-10kDa protein (IP-10) as a promising diagnostic marker; however, its diagnostic utility in a day-to-day clinical setting is unclear. Detection of LAM antigen has not previously been evaluated in pleural fluid. Methods: We investigated the comparative diagnostic utility of established (adenosine deaminase [ADA]), more recent (standardized nucleic-acid-amplification-test [NAAT]) and newer technologies (a standardized LAM mycobacterial antigen-detection assay and IP-10 levels) for the evaluation of pleural effusions in 78 consecutively recruited South African tuberculosis suspects. All consenting participants underwent pleural biopsy unless contra-indicated or refused. The reference standard comprised culture positivity for M. tuberculosis or histology suggestive of tuberculosis. Principal Findings: Of 74 evaluable subjects 48, 7 and 19 had definite, probable and non-TB, respectively. IP-10 levels were significantly higher in TB vs non-TB participants (p<0.0001). The respective outcomes [sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV %] for the different diagnostic modalities were: ADA at the 30 IU/L cut-point [96; 69; 90; 85], NAAT [6; 93; 67; 28], IP-10 at the 28,170 pg/ml ROC-derived cut-point [80; 82; 91; 64], and IP-10 at the 4035 pg/ml cut-point [100; 53; 83; 100]. Thus IP-10, using the ROC-derived cut-point, missed ∼20% of TB cases and mis-diagnosed ∼20% of non-TB cases. By contrast, when a lower cut-point was used a negative test excluded TB. The NAAT had a poor sensitivity but high specificity. LAM antigen-detection was not diagnostically useful. Conclusion: Although IP-10, like ADA, has sub-optimal specificity, it may be a clinically useful rule-out test for tuberculous pleural effusions. Larger multi-centric studies are now required to confirm our findings. Copyright: © 2009 Dheda et al.},

abstract={In-house PCR (hPCR) could speed differential diagnosis between tuberculosis (TB) and nontuberculous mycobacterial disease in patients with positive smears and pulmonary infiltrates, but its reported accuracy fluctuates across studies. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of hPCR sensitivity and specificity for smear-positive TB diagnosis, using culture as the reference standard. After searching English language studies in MEDLINE and EMBASE, we estimated cumulative accuracy by means of summary receiver operating characteristic analysis. The possible influence of hPCR procedures and study methodological features on accuracy was explored by univariate metaregression, followed by multivariate adjustment of items selected as significant. Thirty-five articles (1991 to 2006) met the inclusion criteria. The pooled estimates of the diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, and specificity (random-effect model) were, respectively, 60 (confidence interval [CI], 29 to 123), 0.96 (CI, 0.95 to 0.97), and 0.81 (CI, 0.78 to 0.84), but significant variations (mainly in specificity) limit their clinical applicability. The quality of the reference test, the detection method, and real-time PCR use explained some of the observed heterogeneity. Probably due to the limited study power of our meta-analysis and to the wide differences in both laboratory techniques and methodological quality, only real-time PCR also displayed a positive impact on accuracy in the multivariate model. Currently, hPCR can be confidently used to exclude TB in smear-positive patients, but its low specificity could lead to erroneous initiation of therapy, isolation, and contact investigation. As the inclusion of samples from treated patients could have artificially reduced specificity, future studies should report mycobacterial-culture results for each TB and non-TB sample analyzed.

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the performance of nested PCR (nPCR) in detecting the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in blood samples of patients suspected of having TB, in order to determine its potential for use as an auxiliary tool in the laboratory diagnosis of TB in children. Methods: Detection of the M. tuberculosis complex in blood samples using as a target the insertion sequence IS6110 of the genomic DNA of the bacillus. Blood samples of 120 patients were evaluated. All of the patients were under 15 years of age at the time of their treatment at public hospitals in the city of Recife, Brazil (between January of 2003 and August of 2005). Attending physicians at the hospitals diagnosed TB based on the criteria recommended by the American Thoracic Society. The nPCR amplified a 123-bp fragment with outer oligonucleotides (IS1/IS2) and, in the subsequent reaction, using inner oligonucleotides (IS3/IS4), generating an 81-bp amplicon. Results: Active or latent TB was found in 65 patients, TB was ruled out in 28 suspected cases, and 27 patients were TB-free (controls). The sensitivity of nPCR was 26.15% and was significantly higher for the extrapulmonary form of the disease (55.56%) than for the pulmonary form (18.18%). The specificity was 92.73%. Conclusions: Despite the difficulties in diagnosing TB in children and the low number of cases evaluated in the present study, nPCR in blood samples proved to be a rapid and specific technique, albeit one with low sensitivity. In order to establish its true usefulness in the diagnosis of paucibacillary forms, especially extrapulmonary TB, further studies need to be carried out with a larger sample of children and analyzing biological specimens other than blood.},

abstract={Tuberculosis (TB) is a still prevalent and important disease entity in Korea. TB can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract, and intestinal TB is an important disease of extra-pulmonary TB. The diagnosis of intestinal TB remains a challenge because the signs and symptoms are nonspecific. It should be differentiated from the inflammatory bowel diseases and malignancies, especially Crohn's disease. The diagnosis of intestinal TB should be based on careful clinical evaluation, such as extra-intestinal signs, colonoscopic and histologic evaluation. Newer techniques such as PCR method or test for the diagnosis of latent TB (Interferon-gamma assay) may be helpful. In addition, a high index of suspicion must be kept in mind to ensure a timely diagnosis. Herein, IBD Study Group of the KASID proposes a diagnostic guideline based on currently available evidence and experience, especially those of Korea. We also propose the test which may be helpful to establish the proper diagnosis of intestinal TB.},

abstract={An 87-year-old woman was admitted because of high fever, progressive dyspnea and abnormal shadows on chest roentgenogram. Laboratory investigation on admission demonstrated a normal white cell count with neutrophilia (4000/microl, 90.5% neutrophils), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 10 mm/h and C-reactive protein value of 9.0mg/dl. Roentgenogram and computed tomographic scan of the chest shows bilateral infiltration and diffuse ground glass opacity, indicating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but disseminated nodules, indicating miliary tuberculosis, were not found. Blood gas analysis demonstrated severe hypoxemia (PaO2 43.2Torr with 6L/ min oxygen). Based on the diagnosis of acute pneumonia and ARDS, intravenous administration of sivelestat sodium hydrate (100 mg/day), and continuous infusion of hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) were started. PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved but X-ray findings showed no improvement and a blood test revealed pancytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed necrotizing epithelioid granuloma and acid-fast bacilli. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also detected in sputum and urine. Therefore, we diagnosed miliary tuberculosis and transferred the patient to an infectious disease hospital. Miliary tuberculosis complicated with ARDS is relatively rare and the prognosis is extremely poor. Miliary tuberculosis should be kept in mind as a cause of ARDS.},

abstract={The broad clinical presentation of Leishmaniasis makes the diagnosis of current and past cases of this disease rather difficult. Differential diagnosis is important because diseases caused by other aetiologies and a clinical spectrum similar to that of leishmaniasis (e.g. leprosy, skin cancers and tuberculosis for CL; malaria and schistosomiasis for VL) are often present in endemic areas of endemicity. Presently, a variety of methods have been developed and tested to aid the identification and diagnosis of Leishmania. The advent of the PCR technology has opened new channels for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis in a variety of clinical materials. PCR is a simple, rapid procedure that has been adapted for diagnosis of leishmaniasis. A range of tools is currently available for the diagnosis and identification of leishmaniasis and Leishmania species, respectively. However, none of these diagnostic tools are examined and tested using samples spotted on FTA cards. Three different PCR-based approaches were examined including: kDNA minicircle, Leishmania 18S rRNA gene and PCR-RFLP of Intergenic region of ribosomal protein. PCR primers were designed that sit within the coding sequences of genes (relatively well conserved) but which amplify across the intervening intergenic sequence (relatively variable). These were used in PCR-RFLP on reference isolates of 10 of the most important Leishmania species: L. donovani, L. infantum, L. major & L. tropica. Digestion of PCR products with restriction enzymes produced species-specific restriction patterns allowed discrimination of reference isolates. The kDNA minicircle primers are highly sensitive in diagnosis of both bone marrow and skin smears from FTA cards. Leishmania 18S rRNA gene conserved region is sensitive in identification of bone marrow smear but less sensitive in diagnosing skin smears. The intergenic nested PCR-RFLP using P5 & P6 as well as P1 & P2 newly designed primers showed high level of reproducibility and sensitivity. Though, it was less sensitive than kDNA minicircle primers, but easily discriminated between Leishmania species.},

Nemeth J, Winkler H-M, Zwick RH, Rumetshofer R, Schenk P, Burghuber OC, Graninger W, Ramharter M, Winkler S (Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, Universitätsspital Basel, Basel, Switzerland, Otto-Wagner Hospital; Medical University of Vienna, Vienna; Austria). Recruitment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific CD4+ T cells to the site of infection for diagnosis of active tuberculosis. J Intern Med 2008; 265: 163-168.Context. Accurate and early diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) is problematic as current diagnostic methods show low sensitivity (acid-fast bacilli smears), are time-consuming (culture of biological samples) or show variable results [Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific PCR]. Objectives. In the course of infection, MTB-specific T cells clonally expand at the site of infection and may thus be used as diagnostic marker for active disease. Design. In this cohort study, the frequency of MTB-specific, interferon (IFN)-γ expressing CD4+ T cells obtained from peripheral blood and the site of disease in 25 patients with suspected TB was assessed (n = 11, bronchoalveolar lavage; n = 7, pleural fluid; n = 1, ascites; n = 1, joint fluid; n = 5, cerebrospinal fluid). Results. Amongst 15 patients who showed proven active TB infection, a striking increase of MTB-specific T cells was detected at the site of infection compared with peripheral blood (median increase: 28.5-fold, range: 7.25-531 fold; median of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells from blood: 0.02%, range: 0-0.52%; median of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells from the site of infection: 1.81%, range: 0.29-6.55%, P &lt; 0.001). Main outcome measure. Recruitment of MTB-specific T cells to the site of infection yielded a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90%, irrespective of the compartment affected. Conclusions. The accumulation of MTB-specific T cells at the site of infection may prove as useful diagnostic marker for an accurate and rapid diagnosis of active TB. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={An 83-year-old woman developed high fever and headache for four days. She had disturbance of consciousness and was admitted to our hospital. A lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 268/mm3 and culture became positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Six days after admission, the adenosine deaminase (ADA) level in CSF markedly elevated (43.3 IU/L) with pleocytosis, but a negative PCR test for tuberculosis in CSF, sputum, gastric fluid. She recovered by antibiotics for 45 days and ADA level in CSF was normalized. She was diagnosed as listeria meningitis. High levels of ADA in CSF have high sensitivity and high specificity for tuberculous meningitis, but there are some reports that high ADA levels in CSF in other meningitis. The main biological role of ADA is related to proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes, and specific activity of this enzyme is slightly higher in T-lymphocytes than in B-lymphocytes. Protective immunity to Listeria monocytogenes is exclusively exhibited by T-lymphocytes. We consider that increased ADA levels in listeria meningitis associated with elevation of T-lymphocytes in CSF. This report suggests that listeria meningitis must be included in the differential diagnosis of high levels of ADA in CSF.},

abstract={Background: Tuberculosis is still one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity in many countries and is the second only to human immunodeficiency virus as a cause of death worldwide resulting from a single infectious agent. In 1993, the World Health Organization declared tuberculosis a global public health emergency. Conventional methods for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections are time consuming, as MTB culture requires 3-8 weeks for growth. To determine the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), we have evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in adults with new cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. Setting: Department of Infectious disease of Imam Khomeini Hospital, 2004-2005, Tehran, Iran. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated MTB DNA extracted from 3ml citrated peripheral blood samples from 95 adults with new cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. DNA extraction was performed using a commercial PCR kit with IS1081 primers. For prevention of cross contamination and reduction of false positives, all steps were performed under laminar hood. Results: The 95 patients, 59 of whom were male, had a mean age 44.44 years (SD±20.26); 69 cases had pulmonary and 26 had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. PCR was positive in 32 (33.7%) patients and negative in 63 (66.3%) cases. The overall sensitivity and accuracy of the PCR assay was 44.1% for pulmonary, 19.2% for extra-pulmonary and 10% for disseminated tuberculosis, respectively. Conclusion: The low sensitivity of the IS1081 primer MTB-PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, further studies are needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential of diagnostic tests based on interferon-γ inducible protein (IP)-10 and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-2, and compare the performance with the QuantiFERON TB® Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT; Cellestis, Carnagie, Australia) test. IP-10 and MCP-2 were determined in supernatants from whole blood stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens. Samples were obtained from 80 patients with culture- and/or PCR-proven tuberculosis (TB), and 124 unexposed healthy controls: 86 high school students and 38 high school staff. IP-10 and MCP-2 test cut-offs were established based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. TB patients produced significantly higher levels (median) of IP-10 (2158 pg·mL-1) and MCP-2 (379 pg·mL-1) compared with interferon (IFN)-γ (215 pg·mL-1). The QFT-IT, IP-10 and MCP-2 tests detected 81, 83 and 71% of the TB patients; 0, 3 and 0% of the high school students and 0, 16 and 3% of the staff, respectively. Agreement between tests was high (&gt;89%). By combining IP-10 and IFN-γ tests, the detection rate increased among TB patients to 90% without a significant increase in positive responders among the students. In conclusion, interferon-γ inducible protein-10 and monocyte chemotactic protein-2 responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens could be used to diagnose infection. Combining interferon-γ inducible protein-10 and interferon-γ may be a simple approach to increase the detection rate of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific in vitro tests.

abstract={A 39-year-old woman was referred with a 1-year history of a 4-cm mass of the left axilla, compatible with a lymph node. Itchy red papules that evolved to crusty lesions and subsequently showed varioliform atrophic scarring appeared over the face, extensor surface of the arms, back, thighs, and scalp (Figs 1 and 2). Her history included weight loss of 8.kg, but no other associated symptoms or contact with tuberculosis patients. The blood count showed a normochromic-normocytic anemia with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) slightly elevated at 28 mm in the first hour (normal, < 20 mm). Tuberculin skin test was positive (13 mm with necrotic reaction) and anti-human immunodeficiency virus serology was negative. Four lesional skin biopsies and one lymph node biopsy were performed and sent for histopathology and culture. The skin biopsy showed small-vessel lumen occlusion by tiny thrombi, endothelial hyperplasia, and intense perivascular inflammatory reaction throughout the dermis, together with partial degeneration of collagen, compatible with tuberculid. Lymph node biopsy showed chronic, necrotizing, granulomatous lymphadenitis, consistent with a diagnosis of lymph node tuberculosis. Mycobacteria were absent on Ziehl-Neelsen staining and culture in all specimens. On the basis of the clinical features, positive tuberculin skin test, and histopathologic findings, a diagnosis of papulonecrotic tuberculid associated with tuberculous lymphadenitis was made. A triple therapeutic regimen with rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide was started and the patient evolved with progressive clinical improvement. At the end of treatment at 6 months, there was clinical remission and improvement of anemia and ESR. Four months later, however, there was a clinical relapse of the lesions on the scalp, ultimately resulting in cicatricial alopecia with varioliform atrophic scarring (Figs 3 and 4). A biopsy of these new lesions was performed and showed focal necrosis (V-shaped) in the epidermis and dermis with follicular involvement and thrombotic occlusion of vessels, confirming the diagnosis of tuberculid. The patient was retreated with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 9 months. A new investigation of another internal focus of tuberculosis was negative. In the last 2 years, the patient has had several recurring crops of lesions on the scalp. Further biopsies were taken, with histopathology showing nonspecific inflammatory changes. Cultures for Mycobacterium spp. were negative (five media: Lowenstein-Jensen, Lowenstein-Jensen supplemented with ferric ammonium citrate or pyruvate, Stonebrink and 7H9 supplemented with hemin) under different temperatures and light conditions. In addition, nucleic acid amplification for mycobacterial hsp65 using polymerase chain reaction restriction enzyme analysis methodology (Telenti A, Marchesi F, Balz M, et al.

abstract={Background: Mycobacterium haemophilum was first recovered from subcutaneous lesions of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Because of its special growth requirements (it grows at 30-32 °C and requires iron-supplemented medium), the organism cannot be isolated using routine culture techniques for other mycobacteria. Only a few developed countries have reported infection with this mycobacterium. We report the first two cases diagnosed in Venezuela. Methods: The diagnosis of the first case was established using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction endonuclease analysis of the gene encoding the 65-kDa heat shock protein (hsp65) for the direct identification of M. haemophilum in a clinical specimen in which bacilli were observed on acid-fast smear, but growth was not detected by standard culture procedures. Results: After recognizing this bacterium as a possible cause of infection in our setting, clinical samples of cutaneous lesions were routinely cultured on blood agar at 30 °C for at least 6.weeks, which resulted in the diagnosis of the second case. Conclusions: Dermatologists should consider this bacterium in immunocompromised patients with cutaneous ulcerating lesions. Material from the lesions can be screened for mycobacteria using an acid-fast stain and, if acid-fast bacilli are seen, PCR analysis of mycobacterial hsp65 can be an effective tool for early diagnosis. Appropriate culture methods are required for bacteriologic confirmation of infection with M. haemophilum. © 2008 International Society of Dermatology.},

abstract={Purpose: To provide an up-to-date review of the clinical presentations, investigations, and management of orbital tuberculosis (OTB). Methods: Systematic review of the literature concerning OTB, limiting the results to English-language peer-reviewed journals. Results: Seventy-nine patients from 39 publications were identified as cases of OTB. The condition presents in one of five forms: classical periostitis; orbital soft tissue tuberculoma or cold abscess, with no bony involvement; OTB with bony involvement; spread from the paranasal sinuses; and tuberculous dacryoadenitis. The ocular adnexa, including the nasolacrimal system and overlying skin, may also be involved. Conclusions: Diagnosis can be difficult and may necessitate an orbital biopsy, in which acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and characteristic histopathology may be seen. Growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mTB) from such a specimen remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Ancillary investigations include tuberculin skin tests and chest radiography, but more recently alternatives such as whole blood interferon-γ immunological tests and PCR-based tests of pathological specimens have proven useful. The management of OTB is complex, requiring a stringent public health strategy and high levels of patient adherence, combined with long courses of multiple anti-tuberculous medications. The interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with TB may further complicate management. Copyright © 2008 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.},

abstract={Objectives: To compare the sensitivity and the specificity of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold (QFT-G) and QuantiFERON®-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT) diagnostic tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Methods: One-hundred patients with culture and/or PCR confirmed M. tuberculosis infection and 168 volunteers with no risk factors for M. tuberculosis infection were tested to estimate sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Results: Analysis of data from the tuberculosis (TB) patients with valid results found the sensitivity of QFT-GIT (92.6%, 87/94) to be significantly higher than that for the QFT-G test (81.4%, 79/97; p = 0.023). The specificity of both QFT-GIT and QFT-G was 98.8% (CI: 95.1%-99.8%) with 2 of the 160 low risk subjects with valid results for both tests being positive. Data analysis confirmed the manufacturer's recommended test cut-off as being optimal, but identified higher sensitivity could be obtained by using a lower cut-off, with only a moderate decrease in specificity. Conclusions: The QFT-GIT test had enhanced sensitivity for detection of M. tuberculosis infection over the QFT-G test, whilst maintaining equivalent high specificity. The logistic benefits of the QFT-GIT test format, as well as its higher sensitivity, should enable enhanced TB control. © 2008 The British Infection Society.},

Methods: Twenty-five patients with a clinical diagnosis of TBM and 49 controls, including 27 patients with other infectious diseases of central nervous system and 22 patients with noninfectious neurological diseases, were enrolled in our research. We simultaneously detected anti-mycobacterium bovis BCG IgG secreting cells in both cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood (PBL) by enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT), repeated insertion sequence IS6110 specific for mycobacterium tuberculosis in CSF by PCR and anti-BCG IgG titre in both CSF and PBL by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The sensitivity of ELISPOT was 84.0%, much higher than that of PCR (75.0%) and ELISA (52.3%). The specificities of the three tests were 91.8%, 93.7% and 91.8% respectively. The numbers of CSF cells secreting anti-BCG IgG tested by ELISPOT were even higher in the early phase of TBM, but declined along with the disease progressing (t = -3.183, P = 0.008), which allowed an early diagnosis to be made. Conclusion: ELISPOT technique is proved to be the most valuable test for the early diagnosis of TBM.},

abstract={Graft-verse-host disease (GVHD) is an uncommon fatal complication following liver transplantation (LTx). In mainland China, only six cases have been reported with a morbidity rate up to 1%-2%. Definitive diagnosis was achieved by molecular techniques (HLA typing or PCR-STR) in only two cases and the remaining cases were diagnosed based on typical clinical features with exclusion of other possible causes. All patients died of septic shock or multiple organ failure even after administration of increased corticosteroids and supportive therapy, and reduced immunosuppressive agents. In our center, two cases of GVHD were found among 128 (1.56%) patients. One case was diagnosed by detecting lymphocyte macrochimerism through DNA-STR. Both of them died even after aggressive treatment. In China, the incidence of GVHD is similar to that reported by foreign centers except for an extremely bad prognosis. Rapid diagnosis is crucial for a better prognosis. In China, only 37.5% of cases are diagnosed by molecular methods. We recommend detecting lymphocyte macrochimerism through DNA-STR to get a rapid diagnosis, and interleukin 2-receptor antibody (basiliximab or daclizumab) therapy seems to be a good choice for the disease. © 2008 WJG.

Methods: The Ag85 A gene was amplified from the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by PCR and was inserted into prokaryotic expressing vector pGEX5T to construct pGEX5T-Ag85A recombinant plasmid. The expression of Ag85A protein in E. coli k802 was induced by IPTG. The expressed protein was purified by affinity chromatography and the antigenicity of the expressed protein was confirmed by Western blotting assay. Results: A band about 0.9 kb in length was obtained by PCR and the recombinant plasmid pGEX5T-Ag85A was successfully constructed. A new band about 58 000 in length was observed after IPTG induction in E. coli. The relative molecular weight of the expressed protein was consistent with that expected. A single protein band of 58 000 in length was obtained after purification. The expressed protein could be specifically recognized by the sera of patients with tuberculosis patients.

abstract={The carboxy-terminal region of recombinant heat shock protein 70 of Leishmania donovani has been shown to have an immunodominant epitope. We designed a PCR assay using a new set of primers encompassing the gene sequence from 457 bp to 927 bp, which amplified a segment of the L. donovani genome in a species-specific manner. The assay was sensitive enough to detect 0.5 pg of parasite DNA, which increased 10-fold (0.05 pg) when an internal probe (583-609 bp) was used in the Southern blot. The assay was able to detect parasite DNA from the liver and spleen of L. donovani-infected hamsters as well as lesion aspirates from parasitologically confirmed post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) and bone marrow aspirates from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients. No amplification was seen with axenically cultured promastigotes of L. infantum, L. tropica, L. major, L. mexicana, L. aethiopica or other intracellular organisms such as Entamoeba histolytica, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium vivax or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

abstract={BACKGROUND: Intensive treatment in oncology often leads to severe complications, including infection and coagulation disturbances. Among the most serious are fungal infections which are often life-threatening, and difficult to recognize and treat. We present a patient with severe pneumonia and pleural effusion, that developed during treatment of a soft tissue sarcoma with pulmonary metastases. CASE REPORT: A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the ITU because of marked dyspnoea, bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion. She was intubated and placed on a ventilator, and bilateral pleural drains were inserted. She also required vigorous inotropic support (dopamine + noradrenaline). CRP was 12.5-19.8 mg dL(-1) and procalcitonin was below 1 ng mL(-1)). Lung metastases and tuberculosis were excluded and fungal infection suspected. Aspergillus DNA was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage, and in blood serum (PCR). Amphotericin B and voriconazole were instituted, but without evident success, The girl was severely distressed, required mechanical ventilation with an F1O2 of 0.6, while her CRP increased to 28.4 mg dL(-1). The amphotericin was stopped and replaced with caspofungin, resulting in rapid improvement in her clinical status. The girl was extubated after 21 days of ventilation, however due to a very severe opioid withdrawal syndrome with extreme agitation, she was re-intubated. After a further two weeks on methadone and sedatives, she was extubated again, this time successfully, One month later she was discharged from the hospital, still on oral voriconazole. CONCLUSION: Fungal infection should always be considered in immunocompromised patients with clinical signs of systemic infection. Recognition and treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult and may require multi drug therapy.},

abstract={Tuberculosis of free-ranging and captive wildlife, including species implicated in the maintenance and transmission of Mycobacterium bovis, is a difficult disease to diagnose and control. Historically, diagnosis of tuberculosis has relied largely upon assays of cell-mediated immunity (CMI), such as tuberculin skin testing. This approach, however, is problematic or impractical for use with many wildlife species. Increasingly, in vitro diagnostic tests, including gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-based assays, are replacing or complementing skin testing of cattle and humans. Analogous assays are unavailable for most wildlife because of a lack of species-specific immunological reagents. This report describes the development and validation of a whole-blood assay to quantify antigen-specific IFN-γ mRNA expression by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Oligonucleotide primers and probes were designed and tested for reactivity towards several susceptible species of interest with respect to tuberculosis infection. The assay was subsequently optimized to quantify the IFN-γ mRNA expression in elk and red deer (Cervus elaphus) and was evaluated for its ability to detect mycobacterial antigen-specific responses of experimentally tuberculosis-infected animals. The assay was a simple, rapid, and sensitive measure of antigen-specific CMI. The IFN-γ mRNA responses correlated well with IFN-γ protein production and showed performance in determining an animal's infection status superior to that of either lymphocyte proliferation or IFN-γ protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. An additional advantage is the ease with which the assay can be modified to reliably quantify IFN-γ expression by using consensus sequences of closely related species or of other species for which IFN-γ sequence information is available.

abstract={This study was aimed to establish ELISA for recombinant bovine IFN-γ (BovIFN-γ) detection and provide a new method for diagnosis of pathogenic infection. The total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood leucocytes cultured with PHA mitogen stimulation. Then bovine IFN-γ (BovIFN-γ) gene cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pET28a to obtain the expression plasmid designated as pETBovIFN-γ. The pETBovIFN-γ was further transformed into competent E. coli BL21 cells and a 18kD His-tagged protein as expected was expressed after IPTG induction. By using purified recombinant BovIFN-γ as antigen and lymphocyte-hybridoma technique, four hybridoma cell lines which stably secreted monoclonal antibodies against rBovIFN-γ were generated, designated as A7, A10, G6, and G10. The immunoglobin subset was identified as IgG1. Western-blotting analysis and ELISA demonstrated that the monoclonal antibodies secreted by all the four hybridoma cell lines could react specifically to the recombinant BovIFN-γ, but not irrelative proteins such as Ag85B, ESAT-6-CFP-10 and GM-CSF, suggesting that the four hybridoma cell lines were rBovIFN-γ specific monoclonal antibodies. A sandwich ELISA was established by using A10 secreted monoclonal antibody and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against BovIFN-γ, HRP labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. The results indicated that the sensitivity was 2ng/mL. This sandwich ELISA to detect BovIFN-γ paved the way to develop a sensitive method for specific infection detection such as bovine tuberculosis diagnosis.},

abstract={A 47-year-old male was admitted to a certain hospital with enteritis of unknown etiology 3 months before the admission to our hospital. He was treated with pulsed steroid, followed by high dose prednisolone. He was discharged 2 days prior to our admission with high-grade fever and dyspnea. He came to our emergency room, where his blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature and respiratory rate were 60/30mmHg, 100/min, 36.0°C, and 36/min, respectively. Chest X ray showed diffuse multiple small nodules. He was admitted to our hospital with the presumptive diagnosis of septic shock due to miliary tuberculosis, which was confirmed with sputum PCR of tuberculosis later. He was initiated on mechanical ventilation and was started empirically on anti-tuberculosis antibiotics, meropenem, and vancomycin immediately. Hydrocortisone was started for adrenal insufficiency secondary to chronic steroid treatment. For his septic shock, he was given normal saline bolus and norepinephrine infusion with central venous pressure and systemic blood pressure monitoring. On the second hospital day, his blood pressure was decreased to 50/20mmHg on norepinephrine 25μg/min. Then, we started continuous administration of vasopressin 0.04 units/minute for norepinephrine resistant septic shock. His BP went up to 100/50mmHg. His norepinephrine and vasopressin were successfully tapered off on the 4 th day and 5 th day, respectively. The mechanical ventilation was successfully weaned off on the 10 th day. Vasopressin level is elevated in the early phase of septic shock, but it is decreased to normal range with continued shock. This relative vasopressin deficiency has been reported to be one of the causes of refractory septic shock. Moreover, low dose of vasopressin has been demonstrated to be effective in raising the blood pressure. We reported a case of refractory septic shock which was successfully treated with low dose vasopressin. Low dose of vasopressin might be a useful salvage treatment for patients with refractory septic shock.},

abstract={Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the cause of paratuberculosis, which affects mainly ruminants although there is a growing concern about its possible implication in Crohn's disease in humans especially in connection with environmental spread and risks to the food chain. Retail cheese may represent a significant source of human exposure to MAP and the aim of this study was to assess MAP status in clinically healthy sheep and goats in Greece, comparing techniques routinely used in the positive diagnosis of the disease. From a total of 30 flocks, 632 sheep and goats had faecal, serum, and whole-blood samples examined by culture, complement fixation test (CFT), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeted at IS900, IS1245, and IS6110. PCR produced positive results in 21% of the animals tested, with 5.6%, 3.9%, and 11.5% being identified as MAP, Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, respectively. CFT produced positive and suspicious results in 4.4% and 14.4% of the cases. Faecal cultures were negative in all but a single case that was identified as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-type BC1. Agreement between results obtained by PCR and CFT was poor with isolated cases although an assessment of the MAP positive tests produced similar results for both methods. The findings indicate the need for additional measures of control, although the costs may be substantial if public health protection justifies elimination of MAP from livestock. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={A slightly obtunded 59-year-old man admitted for headache and consciousness disturbance after two weeks of fever, sore throat, and general malaise. His cerebrospinal fluid showed a slight increase in the white cell count and protein content. T2-weighted MRI demonstrated high signal intensity of the bilateral globus pallidus. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was negative for fungi and bacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis. Negative results for PCR and ELISA made herpes simplex virus encephalitis unlikely. We treated him empirically with aciclovir and cefpirome, conducting further tests because a HIV serological test was positive on admission. HIV RNA was 2.9 × 10 5 copies/m/ in the blood. Western blot analysis demonstrated positive bands at gp160, p24, p55, and p68, but negative at gp120, p52, gp41, p40, p34, and p18. These results yielded a definitive diagnosis of acute primary HIV infection presenting as meningoencephalitis. His clinical condition improved over the next few days. Repeated MRI showed a new lesion in the pons on T2-weighted images. No MRI abnormality has reported previously in acute primary HIV infection with meningoencephalitis. High signal intensity in the bilateral globus pallidus and the pons in patients with meningoencephalitis may thus be a useful indicator for acute primary HIV infection.},

abstract={A real-time PCR assay for the measurement of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) mRNA in European badger (Meles meles) blood cultures was developed. The levels of IFN-γ mRNA in blood cultures stimulated with either bovine or avian tuberculin or specific mycobacterial antigens were compared with those in a nonstimulated control blood culture as the basis for determining the tuberculosis (TB) status of live badgers. The assay was validated by testing 247 animals for which there were matching data from postmortem examination and culture of tissues. Relative changes in the levels of IFN-γ mRNA in response to bovine tuberculin and specific antigens were found to be greater among badgers with tissues positive for TB on culture. The test was at its most accurate (87% of test results were correct) by using blood cultures containing bovine tuberculin as the antigen and when the response to avian tuberculin was taken into account by subtracting the avian tuberculin response from the bovine tuberculin response. At a specificity of 90.7%, the test was 70.6% sensitive. At the same specificity, the current serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for TB in badgers was only 53% sensitive. This work demonstrates that measurement of IFN-γ mRNA by real-time PCR is a valid method for the detection of TB in live badgers and may provide an alternative to the current serological methods of diagnosis, the Brock test. The testing procedure can be completed within 5 h of receipt of the blood culture samples. In addition, the use of a molecular biology-based test offers the potential to fully automate the testing procedure through the use of robotics.},

abstract={A 54-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of intermittent high fever, general malaise, cough and body weight loss after he had been examined and treated at the former hospital for 3 years without a definitive diagnosis and effective therapy. Bacterial examination on admission revealed Streptococcus pyogenes in peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirates and pleural effusion. Furthermore, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was detected in sputum, gastric juice, bone marrow liquid, pleural effusion by acid-fast bacillus culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Biopsy of the neck lymph node showed multiple granulomas and the presence of acid-fast bacilli. Administration of ABPC/SBT and later CLDM resulted in disappearance of Streptococcus pyrogenes after 2 weeks. We suspected of generalized immunodeficiency that might underlie the severe bacteremia/osteomyelitis and disseminated MAC infection. We tested interferon (IFN)-γ production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of the patient after phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulation and found that these cells produced no or undetectable levels of IFN-γ in the presence of autologous plasma while produced almost normal levels of IFN-γ in the presence of healthy donor's plasma. Since this neutralizing activity was co-purified in the IgG fraction, the immunodeficient state of the patient seemed to be caused by autoantibody to IFN-γ. As far as we know, this is the first report of a Japanese case of disseminated MAC infection presumably due to autoantibody to IFN-γ. © 2007 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.},

abstract={One of the specific skin lesions occurring after Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination is generalized tuberculid-like eruptions, which occur rarely, but have a tendency to heal spontaneously. Their pathogenesis and relationship to "true" tuberculids are poorly understood. This report presents a case of a 6-month-old girl who developed generalized papulonecrotic tuberculid-like eruptions after BCG vaccination. The skin lesions healed spontaneously in 3 months. Culture of blood, gastric juice and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of papulonecrotic skin biopsies were all negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Histopathology of papulonecrotic eruptions revealed marked epidermal necrosis, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and epidermotropic infiltration of lymphocytes showing markers of CD3+ lymphocytes (90-95% of all infiltrating cells), CD4+ (40-50%), CD8+ (40-50%), and CD45RO+ (70%). In contrast, the BCG vaccination site revealed intradermal granuloma with epithelioid cells, occasional giant cells and infiltration of lymphocytes consisting of CD3+ (60-70%), CD4+ (40-50%), CD8 + (30-40%), CD45RO+ (40%), CD79a+ (30-40%), and CD20+ (20-30%). Our patient did not reveal any signs indicative of tuberculosis. Papulonecrotic lesions were therefore called papulonecrotic tuberculid-like eruptions, rather than tuberculids, that occurred after BCG vaccination and appeared to derive from a hypersensitive reaction mediated by immune lymphocytic infiltration. © 2007 Japanese Dermatological Association.},

From the 144 samples, 121 were characterized as tuberculosis: 119 were positive in cultures, 95 under bacilloscopy and 128 using nested-PCR. The sensibility of the nested-PCR was 96% (116/121), while the specificity was 48% (11/23). Nested-PCR may be a complementary tool for diagnosing tuberculosis, since it presents sensitivity equivalent to that of cultures.

abstract={Objective: To determine whether Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection spreads through the blood to different lymph-node groups in patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis. Design: Prospective analytical study. Setting: The patients were recruited, managed and followed at the lymphodenopathy clinic, Central Police Hospital, Burr, Khartoum, Sudan. Subjects: Fifty two sequential patients were enrolled. Thirty patients with FNAC diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis and positive PCR for M. tuberculosis complex had a mean age of 26.9±11.2 years and similar male, female affection. Nine patients with FNAC tuberculous lymphadenitis, but negative PCR had a slightly higher mean age (32.6±18.2 years) with similar male : female proportions. Patients with reactive lymphadenopathy (9/52) were older than patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis with a mean age of 45±24.6 years. Results: None of the patients were positive for HIV or had clinical or radiological evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. M.tuberculosis DNA was detected in the blood samples of 30/39 (77%) patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis, but in none of the cases with reactive or malignant lymphadenopathy. The presence of M.tuberculosis DNA correlated strongly to multiple lymphnode involvement [OR (odds ratio) = 96.7,95% confidence interval (CI) 9.0-1,039] and to caseatinggranulomatous and predominantly necrotic cytbmorphological categories [OR = 70,95% confidence interval (CI) 7.0 - 703]. Conclusion: M.tuberculosis most probably disseminates through the blood from one node group to the other in patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis.},

abstract={Delay in diagnosis of pulmonary and other forms of tuberculosis (TB) can be fatal, particularly in HIV-infected patients. Hence, techniques based on nucleic acid amplification, which are both rapid and of high specificity and sensitivity, are now widely used and recommended for laboratories that diagnose TB. In the present study, diagnostic methods based on mycobacterial DNA amplification were evaluated in comparative trials alongside tradicional bacterial methods, using negative smear samples from patients with clinically-suspected TB (sputum samples from 25 patients with suspected pulmonary TB, urine samples from two patients with suspected renal TB and cerebrospinal fluid samples from one patient with suspected meningeal TB). A specificity of 100% was achieved with DNA amplification methods and tradicional culture/identification methods, in relation to clinical findings and treatment results. For the smear-negative sputa, conventional PCR for M. tuberculosis was positive in 62% of suspected lung TB case, showing the same sensitivity as bacterial identification. Both techniques failed in the detection of extra-pulmonary samples. Nested PCR showed, after species-specific amplification, a sensitivity of 100% for M. avium and 85% for M. tuberculosis. For extra-pulmonary smear-negative samples, only Nested PCR detected M. tuberculosis and all cases were confirmed clinically. Nested PCR, in which two-step amplification reactions are performed, can identify the two most important mycobacteria in human pathology quickly and directly from clinical spicimens.},

abstract={Two separate studies (study I and study II) were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ELISA serological test for the detection of IgG antibodies against specific glycolipid antigen (PGLTb1) and ESAT 6 antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, respectively. These results were compared with bacteriological tests [Ziehl Neelson (ZN) staining for acid-fast bacilli and culture on Lowenstein Jensen (LJ) medium] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting IS6110 sequence. Both studies were carried out on children with pulmonary, central nervous system, lymph node, and gastrointestinal tuberculosis along with matching controls (65 cases and 27 controls for study I and 83 cases and 22 controls for study II). Informed consents of their parents or guardians were taken. They were subjected to clinical examination, relevant laboratory investigations, tuberculin test and chest radiograph. Relevant body fluids were subjected to bacteriological tests and PCR. Sera samples were analyzed for antibodies against PGLTbl and ESAT 6 antigen in study I and study II, respectively. ELISA tests showed a significantly higher sensitivity (49% study I; 53%, study II) as compared with LJ medium culture method (15.4%, study I; 28.9% study II) and ZN staining (27.7%, study I; 20.5%, study II) in all patients (p < 0.05). The results were comparable with PCR (40%, study I; 42.2% study II). Specificity of ELISA test was 100% in all the patients except in those with pulmonary disease (92.8%, study I; 84.8%, study II).

abstract={Pleural effusion is one of the commonest presentations of tuberculosis, the clinical manifestations being typically abrupt resembling bacterial pneumonia. Since delayed hypersensitivity is the underlying immune response, bacterial load is very low. Owing to these facts, tuberculous pleurisy as an extra-pulmonary disease poses a diagnostic dilemma. The conventional bacteriological methods rarely detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis in pleural fluid and are of limited use in diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. We evaluated the efficacy of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy by targeting the gene segment coding for MPB64 protein specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Based on the clinical criteria, 82 patients with lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion were included in the study. Patients were analyzed in two groups; one group consisting of 48 patients of tubercular pleural effusion confirmed by various diagnostic procedures and another group of 34 patients comprising of non-tubercular pleural effusion. There were no false positive results by PCR and the specificity worked out to be 100%. Twenty two patients tested positive for Mantoux with a sensitivity of 45%. ZN-staining for AFB was found in samples from 15 patients (20% sensitivity). ADA was positive for 28 patients with a sensitivity of 53%. PCR was positive for 32/48 patients (67% sensitivity). Thus, PCR was found to be more sensitive than any other conventional method in diagnosis of clinically suspected tubercular pleurisy.},

abstract={A major challenge for tuberculosis control is mycobacterial detection in paucibacillary disease, particularly in pediatric, extrapulmonary and smear-negative pulmonary infections. We developed a simple and efficient DNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocol for mycobacterial detection and quantification in paucibacillary specimens. The method was refined using an in vitro model mimicking blood specimens which are characterized by the presence of numerous qPCR inhibitors. Mycobacterial DNA detection in blood is of interest given the high sensitivity we previously reported using conventional PCR in blood of patients with tuberculosis lymphadenitis. Mechanical lysis of mycobacteria in the presence of an organic solvent provided the highest sensitivity. Mycobacterial DNA amplification was compromised when the human:bacterial genome ratio was at least 190:1. Separation of the specimen into bacterial- and host-rich fractions prior to DNA extraction improved mycobacterial DNA detection by 30%. Preliminary testing of our protocol in smear-negative, culture-positive specimens (gastric and lymph node aspirates, pleural and cerebrospinal fluid, and blood) confirmed the applicability of our technique to a range of paucibacillary specimens for the detection, quantification and speciation (M. tuberculosis versus M. avium) of mycobacteria, several weeks before culture results were available. Our protocol provides a novel, efficient and simple strategy to improve the performance of qPCR in paucibacillary specimens, including those with excess human DNA background. This tool is useful to study the pathophysiology of early pulmonary or occult tuberculosis, and for more rapid and accurate diagnosis in difficult to diagnose infections. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The aim of the study was to assess the utility of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in blood and urine for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). We prospectively evaluated the usefulness of PCR performed in blood and urine samples from patients with proved or probable TB compared with a control group of patients. The PCR technique was performed using IS6110 primers. We included in the study 57 patients (43 with definite TB and 14 with probable TB) and 26 controls. Blood and urine samples were drawn at the time of microbiologic diagnosis and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months later. Cultures were positive in the early period (<1 month after treatment) in 11 of 57 patients (19%) with probable or definite TB, in comparison with 42% of patients (24/57) who yielded a positive PCR (P = 0.02). Urine samples increased the sensitivity of PCR determination in blood samples by 10%. The PCR in blood and/or urine was positive in 41% of patients with pulmonary TB, in 36% of patients with extrapulmonary TB, and in 50% of patients with disseminated TB. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was still detectable by PCR in 5 of 13 patients with cured TB after 1 or more months of antituberculous treatment. The PCR detection of M. tuberculosis in blood and urine samples is useful for the diagnosis of different clinical forms of TB, mostly in those patients in which sample extraction is difficult or requires aggressive techniques. The sensitivity of this technique could be improved studying more than 1 sample in each patient, even after initiating an antituberculous treatment. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood (PBL) were sampled multiple times from 25 patients with a clinical diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and 49 controls, including 27 patients with other infectious diseases of the central nervous system and 22 patients with other noninfectious neurological diseases. We used an enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) to detect anti-Mycobacterium bovis BCG antibody-secreting cells in CSF and PBL, PCR to detect a repeated insertion sequence (IS6110) specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in CSF, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect anti-BCG antibodies in CSF and PBL. In the meantime, culture of CSF from every TBM and control patient was done on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. ELISPOT proved to be the most valuable test, with a sensitivity of 84.0% and a specificity of 91.8%, and showed a sensitivity of 100.0% with the CSF specimens obtained within 4 weeks after the onset of TBM. The numbers of CSF anti-BCG immunoglobulin-secreting cells tested by ELISPOT were even higher in the early phase of TBM and declined while the disease was going on (P = 0.008), which allowed an early diagnosis to be made. The sensitivities of PCR and ELISA were only 75.0% and 52.3%, respectively; and the specificities were 93.7% and 91.6%, respectively. Culture of CSF on Lowenstein-Jensen medium was the least sensitive (16%) compared to the sensitivities of the other three assays. Our results demonstrate that the ELISPOT technique is worthy for routine use in the laboratory to support the clinical diagnosis of TBM. Copyright © 2006, American Society for Microbiology.

abstract={Objective: To determine the causative organisms and characteristics of patients presenting with meningitis in Bangui in order to provide guidance to physicians for case management. Methods: Adults with proven or suspected meningitis were enrolled in this prospective study. Laboratory tests: Full blood count, blood chemistry, and HIV tests were performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was submitted for routine microbiology, chemistry (glucose, protein), and hematology testing. When classical microbiology analyses were negative, a broad-range bacterial polymerase chain reaction (BRBPCR) was used. Results and conclusions: Of the 276 patients enrolled, 215 (77.9%) were HIV positive. In HIV-positive patients cryptococcal meningitis (CM) was the most common cause of meningitis (39.1%) followed by pyogenic meningitis (PM) (30.7%), mononuclear meningitis (MM) (28.8%), and tuberculous meningitis (TM) (1.4%). In HIV-negative patients, PM was the most common cause (60.7%) followed by MM (37.7%) and CM (1.6%, one case). In-hospital mortality was higher in HIV-positive patients (73/128 = 57%) compared to those HIV negative (3/18 = 16.7%) (p = 0.001). Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 26) was the most common bacterial diagnosis, mainly in HIV-positive patients (n = 22, 10.2%). Meningococcal meningitis (14 Neisseria meningitidis of group A and one W135) was diagnosed in nine (4.2%) HIV-positive and six (9.8%) HIV-negative patients. Gram-negative rods were isolated from five HIV-positive and two HIV-negative patients, respectively. The bacteria and fungi involved in meningitis did not display high levels of in vitro resistance. Conventional microbiology techniques failed to detect the causative agent in 55 (53.4%) PM cases. Broad-range bacterial PCR detected DNA from S. pneumoniae in three samples, N. meningitidis in two, Escherichia coli in one, Listeria monocytogenes in two and Staphylococcus aureus in one sample. In the CSF of five (three HIV negative and two HIV positive), PCR products were not identified with the oligonucleotide probes specific for the usual species of bacteria found in CSF, or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples. Among the MM cases, 77 (90.5%) probable viral meningitis (54 HIV positive and 23 HIV negative) and eight TM (HIV positive) were suspected. © 2006 International Society for Infectious Diseases.},

abstract={Background & objectives: Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is largely based on microscopy and culture examination which are either less sensitive, or time consuming. In the present study a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test based on DNA sequence coding for a 38-kilodalton protein antigen b (Pab), specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was compared with Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained AFB (acid fast bacilli) smear examination, culture based on conventional Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium and radiometric BACTEC 460 system for the diagnosis of TB using clinical samples obtained from pulmonary and extra-pulmonary cases of TB. Methods: Clinical samples obtained from 168 patients of suspected TB (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) were subjected to ZN smear examination, LJ culture, radiometric BACTEC culture and a PCR test by amplifying 419bp sequence coding for Pab, a glycoprotein of molecular weight 38 kDa. Results: A significant difference was seen in the sensitivity of different tests, the figures being 74.2 per cent for PCR test, 53.4 per cent for BACTEC culture, 47.1 per cent for LJ medium based culture and 35.2 per cent for ZN smear examination (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference between different tests as far as specificity was concerned. PCR test sensitivity in pulmonary and extra-pulmonary clinical samples were 74.3 and 71.5 per cent respectively, being significantly higher (P<0.05) when compared with sensitivity of other tests. The mean detection time for M. tuberculosis was 24.0 days by LJ media culture, 12.8 days by BACTEC culture and less than 1 day by smear examination and PCR test. Interpretation & conclusion: PCR test is more sensitive than ZN smear examination, LJ medium culture and BACTEC culture for diagnosing TB in pulmonary and extra-pulmonary clinical samples.},

abstract={Respiratory illness is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in African children. The spectrum of disease includes acute and chronic respiratory illness. As a result of the HIV epidemic currently occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-associated acute and chronic respiratory disease has emerged as a major factor in the epidemiology of childhood respiratory illness. Pneumonia is the leading causes of childhood mortality responsible for approximately 21% of deaths in African children under five years of age each year. The HIV pandemic has increased the incidence, severity and pneumonia mortality in African children. Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of morbidity and death. Globally, the highest TB incidence rates occur in sub-Saharan African countries; many of these countries are also experiencing a dual HIV epidemic, resulting in an exponential increase in TB cases. The burden of childhood respiratory illness has necessitated novel and improved ways of diagnosis, treatment and prevention, particularly in the context of limited resources. Improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention of pneumonia have been a research focus, particularly in HIV-infected children. African studies have provided information on the epidemiology, aetiology and outcome from pneumonia in HIV-infected and uninfected children. The efficacy of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis in reducing mortality and morbidity in HIV-infected African children was shown in the only randomized controlled trial. Two large studies have shown the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in an African context. Regarding TB, areas of research include diagnostic studies and improved preventative strategies. Promising diagnostic studies for childhood TB include the use of sputum induction, PCR techniques and blood interferon assays. The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has emerged as a new clinical entity in HIV-infected children with TB associated with use of antiretroviral therapy. New preventative strategies for TB include novel vaccines and primary prophylaxis. Available, effective interventions for prevention and treatment of childhood respiratory disease exist; the challenge is to achieve widespread implementation and high coverage rates in African countries. Greater access to newer vaccines and, in HIV-infected children, to anti-retroviral therapy and prophylaxis is necessary to further reduce the burden of childhood respiratory illness in Africa. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={BACKGROUND: The rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly those that represent a public health problem, like tuberculosis, is a challenging problem. By using nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, one may be able to diagnose, the disease on the day of arrival of specimen in the laboratory. For diagnosis of tuberculosis by direct methods like PCR, specimens from site of infection are required. In certain cases it is difficult to get the specimens from site of infection and in such situations; some researchers have tried to detect the DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from blood of these patients. The purposive of this study is to determine the diagnostic efficacy of peripheral blood-based polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: This was a simple descriptive study, carried out in Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi from Jan 2004 to Dec 2004. Sputum and blood samples were collected from 96 suspected patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum samples processed for ZN staining and AFB culture (gold standard) and blood samples processed for PCR. RESULTS: Out of 96 cases, 60 (62.5%) were culture positive. PCR was positive in 14 (14.5%). AFB smear positive were 34 (35.4%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 20% and 94.4% respectively and the positive and negative predictive values were 85.71% and 41.46% respectively. The overall efficiency of the test was 47.91%. CONCLUSION: Due to low sensitivity; a negative PCR assay does not rule the disease. However, this test may be helpful in cases where specimens from the site of infection are not available.},

The need for an early empirical therapy for suspected military tuberculosis is emphasized in particular. □ Case Report: A 32-year-old Moroccan woman was admitted to the hospital with aphasia and a hemiparesis due to an intracerebral hemorrhage caused by a ruptured septic A. cerebri media aneurysm. Despite intensive work-up no septic focus could be found. Chest radiograph and computerized tomography (CT) showed miliary consolidations in the lungs. Skin testing (Tuberkulin Behring GT5) and smears for acid-fast bacilli and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for tuberculosis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were negative. A four-drug antituberculous regimen (rifampicin [RMP], isoniazid [INH], pyrazinamide [PZA], ethambutol [EMB]) was initiated, and resulted in normalization of temperature, blood pressure, and C-reactive protein. Subsequently, cultures of BAL yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was discharged, a two-drug regimen was conducted (RMP, INH) after 2 months. Follow-up of the patient showed a significant improvement of the miliary lung consolidations after 5 months in CT of the lung. Only minor neurologic symptoms persisted after cessation of the therapy. □ Conclusion: In developed countries, miliary tuberculosis is a very rare cause of septic infiltrative lung disease. However, due to the nonspecific nature of the presentation and despite improved diagnostic techniques, a high clinical suspicion is essential for successful treatment. © Urban & Vogel.},

abstract={Study design: Review of medical and radiological records and literature to study the diagnosis of tuberculous vertebral osteomyelitis (TVO) and the differential diagnosis between TVO and pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO). Objective: To identify the correct criteria for the diagnosis. Setting: National Spinal Injuries Centre, UK. Methods: (1) Medical and radiological records of 10 patients diagnosed as vertebral osteomyelitis and treated elsewhere but later admitted to the NSIC were reviewed retrospectively. (2) Medical literature on vertebral osteomyelitis were reviewed. Results: (1) Case review: Before the study, four of the 10 patients TVO had been diagnosed based on positive bacteriology. Of the other six, the diagnosis of PVO had been made in one based on positive blood culture of staphylococcus while in another without any positive result of bacteriology. The diagnosis had been uncertain in four because of negative results of both bacteriology and histology on both tuberculous and pyogenic infection. The author made the diagnosis of TVO in all 10 cases based on clinical manifestations and plain radiographs. Highly raised ESR with moderate rise of or normal WBC in eight cases supported TVO. Computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging did not contribute to the differential diagnosis. Laminectomy in five patients led to some clinical improvement. The five patients without surgery deteriorated. Two of them died. (2) Literature review: A total of 188 articles were reviewed. The crucial role of plain radiographs in the diagnosis of TVO and the high incidence of false-negative of tuberculosis in both bacteriological and histological tests were neglected in most articles. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was more reliable in diagnosing tuberculosis. Conclusion: Clinical manifestations, discrepancy between ESR and WBC, plain radiographs and PCR are keys to a correct diagnosis of TVO. © 2005 International Spinal Cord Society.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of positive induced sputum cultures among probable childhood tuberculosis (TB) cases, to describe the laboratory and radiological features of childhood TB in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HFV), and to determine the prevalence of HIV infection in these patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. METHOD: Seven hundred and fifty children with suspected TB were evaluated clinically, by chest radiography and by tuberculin test (Mantoux). Probable cases underwent sputum induction or lymph node biopsy, HIV testing and RNA-PCR tests. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The Mantoux test was positive in 55/121 (45%) of the patients; low sensitivity to Mantoux was associated with HIV infection (P = 0.000). Induced sputum yielded 12/101 (12%) positive smears of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 30/101 (30%) positive cultures. Six of the eight lymph node biopsies were culture-positive, and the histology of seven samples was supportive of TB. Most of the children with probable and confirmed TB presented with similar signs, symptoms and chest radiography patterns, irrespective of HIV status. Elevated ESR had no significant role in the diagnosis of TB in children and even more so in the presence of HIV infection. The HIV infection rate was high among children with TB (49%). © 2005 The Union.},

abstract={Clinical bacteriology pertaining to acid-fast bacteria has made marked advances over the past decade, initiated by the development of a DNA probe kit for identification of acid-fast bacteria. Wide-spread use of nucleic acid amplification for rapid detection of tubercle bacillus contributed more greatly than any other factor to such advances in this field. At present, 90% of all kits used for nucleic acid amplification in the world are consumed in Japan. Unfortunately, not a few clinicians in Japan have a false idea that the smear method and nucleic acid amplification are necessary but culture is not. In any event nucleic acid amplification has exerted significant impacts on the routine works at bacteriology laboratories. Among others, collecting bacteria by pretreatment with NALC-NaOH has simplified the introduction of the collective mode smear method and liquid media. Furthermore, as clinicians have become increasingly more experienced with various methods of molecular biology, it now seems possible to apply these techniques for detection of genes encoding drug resistance and for utilization of molecular epidemiology in routine laboratory works. Meanwhile, attempts to diagnose acid-fast bacteriosis by checking blood for antibody have also been made, primarily in Japan. At present, two kits for detecting antibodies to glycolipids (LAM, TDM, etc.) are covered by national health insurance in Japan. We have an impression that in Japan clinicians do not have adequate knowledge and skill to make full use of these new testing methods clinically. We, as the chairmen of this symposium, hope that this symposium will help clinicians increase their skill related to new testing methods, eventually leading to stimulation of advances in clinical practices related to acid-fast bacteria in Japan. 1. Smear microscopy by concentration method and broth culture system: Kazunari TSUYUGUCHI (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center) Smear microscopy and culture still remain the cornerstone to diagnose tuberculosis. However, the classical methods in Japan using direct microscopy and Ogawa solid media were not sufficient for clinical use. In recent years substantial advance has been made in these fields. Concentration of clinical samples by centrifugation improves the sensitivity of smear microscopy with excellent reproducibility. The Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) system using liquid media yields high sensitivity and rapidity. Using these methods, more and more tuberculosis cases would be correctly diagnosed and treated adequately based on drug susceptibility testing. 2. New technologies for anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing : Satoshi MITARAI (Bacteriology Division, Reference Centre for Mycobacterium, Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association) Several new technologies have been developed to obtain anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing (AST) results rapidly, utilising liquid culture and molecular technologies. Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT), as a popular liquid culturing and AST system, was evaluated for its accuracy and usefulness. As for isoniazid, MGIT showed 12.6% of discordant result comparing with standard method. These MGIT resistant and Ogawa susceptible strains had relatively high MICs ranging 0.13 to 2.0 μ g/m/. The molecular detection of resistant gene mutation is also a useful method to estimate drug resistance rapidly. The rpoB mutation detection is reliable with high sensitivity and specificity. 3. Nucleic acid amplification and novel diagnostic methods: Shunji TAKAKURA (Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine) Sensitivities of nucleic acid amplificatiion tests (NAATs) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis meet clinical requirement that patients with high-risk of transmission should be identified within a day. Comparison of the performance of various NAATs is difficult because of the difference in sample processing and in samples tested among methods and reports. Considering the limitations of NAATs (low sensitivity compared with culture, inability to differentiate dead bacilli from the living), further advances would be expected when novel technologies could confer additional imformation, such as drug susceptibility, quantity, viability, and genotype. 4. Serodiagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease : Seigo KITADA (Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Toneyama National Hospital) Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) organisms are ubiquitous in environment and a contamination in respiratory tracts is sometimes observed, and that complex the diagnosis. We developed a serodiagnostic method for MAC disease using an enzyme immunoassay with the MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid (GPL) core as antigen. A significant increase in GPL core antibodies was detected in sera of patients with MAC pulmonary diseases compared to patients who were colonized with MAC, patients with M. kansasii disease and tuberculosis and healthy subjects. The serodiagnosis is useful for diagnosis of MAC lung disease. 5. Molecular epidemiologic tools for tuberculosis: IS6110 RFLP, Spoligotyping, and VNTR: Tomoshige MATSUMOTO, Hiromi ANO, Tetsuya TAKASHIMA, Izuo TSUYUGUCHI (Osaka Prefectural Medical Center for Respiratory and Allergic Diseases) We have performed molecular typing on about 1,300 culture positive clinical isolates that made up the majority of tuberculosis strains in part of southeast Osaka since 2001 until now. By spoligotyping, about 75% of entire strains belonged to the Beijing strain. Particular spoligotyping descriptions, which were not described in SpolDBIII, were found in the strains with lower than 6 copies of IS6110 RFLP. We described them as Osaka type. We could also show that direct typing from Tb PCR positive sputum of patients with tuberculosis was possible by VNTR and that VNTR with 16 loci was useful in tuberculosis typing in Osaka.},

abstract={Miliary tuberculosis is the most serious form of tuberculous disease, but is rarely complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). When a patient with miliary tuberculosis initially presents with ARDS, the mortality is much higher. Therefore, the early detection of miliary tuberculosis as the underlying cause of ARDS is very important for the prognosis and survival of the patient. The diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis may be easy if the patient presents typical clinical manifestations associated with the characteristic pattern of miliary nodules on chest radiology. However, the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis when complicated with ARDS can be difficult due to the nonspecific radiologic patterns, such as diffuse bilateral consolidation and ground glass opacity, without miliary nodular infiltration. However, these nonspecific patterns are known as less likely findings of miliary tuberculosis. We experienced a pregnant woman with miliary tuberculosis, mimicking ARDS due to bilateral severe pneumonia. She was admitted, via the emergency room, with sudden onset of fever, chill, cough and dyspnea. The initial chest PA and HRCT showed diffuse bilateral consolidation and ground glass opacity, without miliary nodular infiltration. All bacteriological studies, including blood and sputum cultures, tuberculosis-PCR and serologic study for infectious disease were negative. However, the definite diagnosis of unusual miliary tuberculosis as the underlying cause of ARDS was confirmed from the radiological finding and transbronchial fiberoptic lung biopsy. We report this case, with a review of the literature.},

abstract={Tuberculosis continues to be a universal health problem and recent studies showed an increased incidence of all forms of this disease. We report the case of a 81 year old female patient with a large left cervical tumour and cutaneous lesions that proved to be an unusual form of tuberculosis. The patient had a 2 years history of slowly increasing left cervical mass with no significant clinical manifestation. Medical assistance was requested mostly by the family, concerned about the large mass visible on the left side of the patient's neck. Clinical and laboratory investigation revealed: a large left laterocervical tumour and the presence of erythematous, non pruriginous skin lesions. No significant changes were shown by routine blood tests. Thyroid function was in the normal range. Neck ultrasound revealed the presence of a 5/6 cm, well defined hypoechoic mass and the thyroid scan showed no accumulation of the radiotracer in the cervical tumour. Routine tuberculosis test was negative and the patient had no sign of pulmonary involvement. Histopathological examination after ablation of this tumour showed the presence of granulomatous lesions suggesting tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. The same aspect was seen after histopathological examination of the specimens from cutaneous biopsy. The diagnosis was certified by the PCR amplification of the DNA extracted from the skin lesions, which led to the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The cutaneous lesions were clearly improved after tuberculostatic treatment, supporting the hypothesis of a rare form of cutaneous tuberculosis.},

Children were categorized as per CDC classification of Pediatric HIV. The diagnosis was confirmed by serological tests or PCR assay. CD4-CD8 counts were done by FACS Count. Results: Majority of the children were between 18 months to 5 years. Adolescents comprised 24% of the case. 51.5% children were infected through the mode of mother to child transmission. 39% of the case was transfusion-mediated. Unsafe medical injections probably contributed to 6.2% and heterosexual promiscuity led to 3.1% cases. Clubbing, not described in Indian studies so far, was seen in 9.3% cases. Conclusions: HIV infection is a chronic childhood disease extending into adolescence, and contaminated blood and unsafe medical injections are still important routes of HIV transmission in India.},

The result of M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in sputum, ascitic fluid, CSF and urine samples were found to be similar in both the primers used. It is suggested that, M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in blood samples using MPB64 primers sometime gives false positive result and therefore, may not be recommended for blood samples. As in other samples both the primers gave almost the same result and therefore, both the primers can be used for MTB DNA PCR vice versa in order to cross check if one gives dubious result.},

abstract={The current study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and evaluated it as a diagnostic screening aid for avian tuberculosis (TB) in a wildfowl collection at the Widfowl and Wetlands Trust Centre at Llanelli, Wales, U.K.. Four hundred and eighteen birds of the collection, including geese, ducks, and swans, were screened for mycobacterial antibody levels. Of those birds tested, 40 died during the period of this study and gross post mortem examinations were performed. The ELISA showed a sensitivity of 76.9% and a specificity of 55.6% using post-mortem findings as the 'gold standard'. Thirteen of the examined birds showed evidence of avian TB at necropsy. In addition, liver and spleen biopsies of 19 birds were examined histopathologically. There was minimal agreement between gross post mortem and histopathological findings. PCR performed on 13 of the specimens prepared for histopathology did not identify the presence of mycobacterial DNA. The findings reveal a need for further research to improve the sensitivity and specificity of this ELISA and the accurate diagnosis of avian TB.},

Only three of 12 patients with a positive blood culture had a PCR result positive for M. avium in peripheral blood. The identification of mycobacteria by PCR in blood culture took about 3 days, reducing the time to diagnosis by several weeks. These results demonstrate that PCR is a sensitive and quick method for identifying mycobacteria, especially when a good DNA extraction method is applied. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract={Skin test negative cattle from a herd containing an unusually high proportion (194/382) of tuberculin skin test positive cattle were investigated for remaining Mycobacterium bovis infected animals. Blood samples from the skin test negative cattle, analysed by an antibody ELISA and an interferon-gamma assay, were mostly test negative for M. bovis. Radiometric culture of nasal mucus samples from 48 of the cattle yielded 22 culture positives with acid-fast bacilli and cording in 6 of these. Subculture on solid media was successful for 7, including 2 with cording of the 22 radiometric culture positives. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA probe testing using the Accuprobe (Gen-Probe, Inc.) and M. tuberculosis complex-specific PCR amplification, performed on the solid media subcultures, were negative. 16S rRNA PCR and sequence analysis were successful for 6 of the 7 solid media subcultures obtained and revealed the presence of Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum in all 6 subcultures. This is the first report of M. nonchromogenicum in nasal mucus of cattle. The observation highlights the importance of integrating definitive tests such as the PCR for diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis and indicates a possible zoonotic risk. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={SETTING: Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in AIDS is critical for optimal treatment to reduce mycobacterial dissemination, HIV-1 replication and mortality. The inadequate sensitivity of Ziehl-Neelsen staining and its inability to distinguish atypical mycobacteria delays accurate diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of TB in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blood and extra-pulmonary samples from patients with AIDS and pulmonary infiltrates. DESIGN: Specimens from 103 HIV-1-infected patients were prospectively analysed using bacteriological methods and IS6110-PCR. Smear-positive samples were also tested using 16S ribosomal-DNA-PCR to identify Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. Gold standard diagnosis relied on positive cultures or treatment outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients exhibited TB, one TB and MAC and four MAC. The sensitivity of IS6110-PCR was 100% in smear-positive samples, 81.8% in smear-negative BAL, 66.7% in extra-pulmonary samples and 42.9% in blood. Its specificity was 97.1% in BAL and 100% in extra-pulmonary and blood specimens. The 16S rDNA-PCR identified M. avium from all smear-positive samples that grew MAC. CONCLUSIONS: IS6110-PCR proved useful in evaluating episodes with probable clinical diagnosis of pulmonary or mixed TB and negative smears, whereas 16S rDNA-PCR would be helpful for prompt differential diagnosis of MAC in smear-positive specimens.},

abstract={The gold standard for diagnosis of tuberculosis is demonstration of mycobacteria from various body fluids. This is often not possible in children due to pauci-bacillary nature of illness. Significant improvement in understanding of molecular biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has led to development of newer diagnostic techniques of tuberculosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosis of TB in children. However, its role in day-to-day clinical practice needs to be defined. A negative PCR never eliminates possibility of tuberculosis, and a positive result is not always confirmatory. The PCR may be useful in evaluating children with significant pulmonary disease when diagnosis is not readily established by other means, and in evaluating immunocompromised children (HIV infection) with pulmonary disease. In the absence of good diagnostic methods for tuberculosis, a lot of interest has been generated in serodiagnosis. ELISA has been used to detect antibodies to various purified or complex antigens of M. tuberculosis in children. Despite a large number of studies published over the past several years, serology has found little place in the routine diagnosis of tuberculosis in children, even though it is rapid and does not require specimen from the site of disease. Sensitivity and specificity depend on the antigen used, gold standard for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and the type of tubercular infection. Though most of these tests have high specificity, their sensitivity is poor. In addition, these tests may be influenced by factors such as age, prior BCG vaccination and exposure to environmental mycobacteria. The serological tests, theoretically, may not be able to differentiate between infection and disease. At present, serodiagnosis does not appear to have any role in diagnosis of childhood pulmonary tuberculosis. A new test (QuantiFERON-TB or QFT) that measures the release of interferon-gamma in whole blood in response to stimulation by purified protein derivative is comparable with the tuberculin skin testing to detect latent tubercular infection, and is less affected by BCG vaccination. It can also discriminate responses due to nontuberculous mycobacteria, and avoids variability and subjectivity associated with placing and reading the tuberculin skin test. Polymerase chain reaction based test for identification of katG and rpoB mutation which are associated with isoniazid and rifampicin resistance may help in early identification of drug resistance in mycobacterium.},

Early colonoscopy showed severe colitis with ulceration. Histological samples confirmed granulomatous inflammation with acid-resistant Ziehl-Neelson-positive microorganisms of mycobacterial type. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of native mucosal biopsies specified the infectious organism as Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The patient responded well to anti-mycobacterial therapy and was still asymptomatic after 6 months with a stable graft function. Our case shows that tuberculosis can be a severe clinical problem in transplant recipients. Most of the patients with intestinal tuberculosis, reported to literature, were diagnosed post mortem or after explorative laparotomy and bowel resection. Thus, intestinal tuberculosis should be considered when a transplant recipient shows abdominal symptoms with no clear evidence of another infection.

The signs of the latent activity of tuberculosis were detected in all the children of all three groups, being more pronounced in Group 3. Thus, MBT and TAb were revealed in 90% of the children in Group 3 and in 52.9 and 76.0% in Groups 1 and 2, respectively. There were higher levels of alpha 1-PI in 96.6 and 75.0% in Groups 3 and 1, respectively. There were signs of intoxication in 80 and 88% and a hyperergic Mantoux reaction in 44.0 and 43.3%, respectively. The frequency of the signs of activity did not greatly differ. Thus, children with newly diagnosed respiratory tuberculosis in the phase of calcification should be regarded as having the signs of tuberculosis activity, followed up as Group I patients, and prescribed chemotherapy for 3-6 months or more, depending on the extent of the process.},

abstract={An 84-year-old woman began to have low fever below 38 degrees C with slight lassitude from June 19, 2002. Despite oral administration of Clarithromycin for 3 days, the fever did not subside and the lassitude increased, so she was admitted to our department. While inflammatory findings were noticed, the cause was not identified by blood and imaging examinations (thoracoabdominal CT, etc.). Although her tuberculin reaction was positive, symptoms indicative of pulmonary tuberculosis were absent. Administration of Cefotiam and Imipenem Cilastatin sodium was ineffective. Pyometra was diagnosed. After drainage, the uterine cavity was washed every day. On the basis of culture of fluid retained a few colonies of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated, but were not identified, Cefpirome was administered, whereupon the fever subsided gradually, but mild inflammatory findings remained. Even after discharge on July 24, the retention increased, so drainage and washing were done repeatedly. However, mild inflammatory findings persisted. She began to have a fever from September 17 and was readmitted. After admission, administration of Flomoxef sodium was started, but no improvement was seen. A small amount of hydrothorax appeared on the left. Thoracocentesis yielded a bloody, slightly turbid exudative. Acid-fast staining and Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific PCR of pleural effusion were negative, but adenosindeaminase was 87.4 U/l. Therefore, a diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy was made. DNA/PCR of tubercle bacilli in the fluid retained in the uterus was positive, and re-retention was prevented by administration of anti-tuberculosis drugs. These findings suggest a strong possibility of tubercle bacillus having been the causative bacteria. Particularly in the case of the elderly, it appears important that pyometra be included in differential diagnosis as the cause of fever even without gynecological symptoms and that tubercle bacillus be considered the causative bacterium.},

Computed tomography revealed solitary mediastinal lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and a small amount of ascites. No lung parenchymal lesion was seen. Although lymphocyte predominance without atypia and a high adenocine deaminase concentration in the pleural fluid were compatible with tuberculous pleurisy, no mycobacteria could be detected either with Ziehl-Nielsen stain or with PCR. Because the serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2 R) level was unexpectedly high (> 8,000 U/ml), and a level not previously reported in benign diseases, we performed thoracoscopy- and mediastinoscopy-assisted biopsies, both of which eventually confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis. After a 4-drug anti-tuberculous regimen was initiated, pleural effusion and ascites subsided, with a marked decrease in the sIL-2R level. This case indicates that in tuberculous pleurisy, serum sIL-2R can rise to a level suggestive of hematological malignancies, it and also illustrates the validity of thoracoscopy-assisted pleural biopsy in such situations.},

abstract={In a search for developing new skin test reagents, MPB70 protein antigen was a candidate antigen for the Diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. First M. bovis BCG genomic DNA was extracted purified and the mpb70 gene was amplified by PCR. The gene was then ligated to an expression vector, PQE. After transformation of the expression E. coil M15 host strain with the PQE plasmid, the expression was induced using 10 mM of IPTG. Two bands were seen in the SDS-PAGE analysis the 44 and 50 KDa represents the dimmers of the nonglycosylated and glycosylated form of the reMPB70 antigen. The His-tagged reMPB70 antigen was then purified by metal affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose. Protein refolding was done by the use of the co solvent Polyethylene glycol MW 3000. The diagnostic potential of the re-MPB70 was evaluated using sera from experimentally sensitized guinea pigs with different strains of mycobacteria (M. bovis BCG, M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii and M. intracellular) using ELISA test. The results indicated the efficiency of MPB70 but not bovine PPD to discriminate between M. bovis sensitized guinea pigs and those sensitized with other mycobacterial strains at serum dilution of 1150. In a field trials to using reMPB70 antigen for the serodiagnosis of bovine tuberculosis using ELISA test. Fifty serum samples from tuberculin +ve and 6 from tuberculin -ve cattle were used as well as 10 tuberculin +ve buffaloes. All +ve animals were confirmed to be M. bovis infected by P/M analysis, bacteriological examination. ELISA results revealed that reMPB70 could recognize the tuberculin +ve infected animals at serum dilution of 1/50 and that it could diagnose tuberculosis in cattle as well as buffaloes.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The group of 41 children with the diagnosis of jia, arthralgia, reactive arthritis and nodular erythema according to EULAR criteria was examined. In early stage of arthritis lasting less than 3 months, there were 22 and in prolonged period lasting more than 3 months there were 19 children. RESULTS: No evidence of PB19 genome was detected by PCR reaction in blood of the examined patients. The possible reasons of the obtained negative results in this study were discussed. CONCLUSIONS: PB19 research should be performed in more cases of children's arthritis, both using PCR and by serological methods.},

abstract={Brucellosis is a world-wide re-emerging zoonosis and the most frequent laboratory-acquired bacterial infection, causing severe disease in humans with unspecific clinical signs affecting numerous organs. Contact with infected animals, ingestion of contaminated animal products and handling of Brucella isolates in laboratories are risk factors. Various other febrile illnesses, e.g. malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid fever and tularemia may present with the same symptoms. Therefore, clinical diagnosis is difficult to establish but effective therapy requires an early diagnosis. Vaccines for humans are still not commercially available. Blood culturing of Brucella is time-consuming and not reliable. Thus diagnosis is usually based on indirect serological tests, i.e. serum agglutination test, complement fixation or the Coombs test. However, these 'conventional' serological tests lack sensitivity and specificity. Hence, a combination of various tests is mandatory for a definite diagnosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays can be used for screening and confirmation of brucellosis in one step. Molecular techniques like the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism are needed to differentiate species and strains within the genus Brucella. This review will summarize advantages and disadvantages of the techniques used in clinical laboratories for direct detection and identification of Brucella spp.},

Skeletal tuberculosis is an indolent disease, and diagnosis may be delayed. Conventional methods are time consuming and have a low sensitivity rate. In recent years PCR-based protocols raised hopes as a reliable and fast diagnostic tool for extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The authors report the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA in specimens from six patients using a nested PCR protocol specific for IS6110 insertion element of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Three men and three women are reported with ages ranging from 42 to 68 years. The sites of infection were the knee and shoulder in one case each, the hip in two cases, and the thoracic spine in two cases. Diagnosis was established within three days, and treatment was initiated promptly. PCR is a technically easy approach that can be used as a first step diagnostic tool for early recognition and treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis.},

abstract={SETTING: In countries with high HIV rates, diagnosis of lower respiratory disease etiology is both challenging and clinically important. OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiology of lower respiratory tract disease among persons with suspected tuberculosis (TB) and abnormal chest X-rays in a setting with very high HIV seroprevalence. DESIGN: Cross-sectional prevalence data from a prospective cohort of predominantly hospitalized adults with suspected TB in Botswana, January-December 1997. RESULTS: Of 229 patients, 86% were HIV-positive and 71% had a pathogen identified. TB was confirmed in 52%, 17% had acute mycoplasma pneumonia, 3% had Pneumocystis carinii, 27% grew a bacterial pathogen from sputum and 8% from blood. Ninety-four per cent of TB diagnoses were made through expectorated sputum and only 5% of TB cases were diagnosed by sputum induction alone. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis had positive and negative predictive values of 94% and 59%, respectively. Male sex, cough <2 weeks, and tuberculin skin test ≥5 mm were independently associated with culture-positive TB among persons with negative acid-fast bacilli smears. Coinfection with two or more pathogens occurred in 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was quite common despite clinical suspicion of TB, and sputum induction and PCR did not significantly improve our ability to diagnose TB, although clinical presentation had some predictive value.},

abstract={The numerous extrapulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis have been well described. Intracranial localizations, including brain stem tuberculoma, are very rare. The authors report a case of brain tuberculoma in a patient with a history of primary pulmonary tuberculosis successfully treated more than twenty years earlier. The patient presented with signs of infection, although the fever disappeared temporarily after successive treatments for malaria (confirmed Plasmodium falciparum), as well as neurological signs with left hemiparesis. Chest radiographs showed no signs of progressive pulmonary tuberculosis, and blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid testing, and HIV serology were all negative. Treatments for maxillary sinusitis, the malaria, bacterial meningitis, and cerebral abscess were equally ineffective. Brain stem tuberculoma was diagnosed only when the patient was transferred to a hospital equipped with neuroimaging equipment and was confirmed after histopathological examination of the intracranial lesion biopsies and the detection of mycobacterium DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the cerebrospinal fluid. A review of 147 cases of intracranial tuberculoma reported in Africa between 1985 and 2001 points out the difficulties of both the differential diagnosis (tuberculoma or other intracranial space-occupying lesions) and treatment in African areas where neuroimaging is unavailable. Our patient's brainstem tuberculoma probably resulted from reactivation of latent tuberculosis.},

abstract={Aim: To determine the clinical, radiographic and laboratory characteristics, diagnostic methods, and therapeutic variables in immunocompetent patients with tuberculosis (TB) of the pancreas and peripancreatic lymph nodes. Methods: The records of 16 patients (6 male, 10 female; mean age 37 years, range 18-56years) with tuberculosis of the pancreas and peripancreatic lymph nodes from 1983 to 2001 in the Southwest Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. In addition, 58 similar cases published in Chinese literature were reviewed and summarized. We reviewed the clinical, radiographic and laboratory findings, diagnostic methods, therapeutic approaches, and outcome in the patients. Criteria for the diagnosis of pancreatic tuberculosis were the presence of granuloma in histological sections or the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Predominant symptoms consisted of abdominal nodule and pain (75 %), anorexia/weight loss (69 %), malaise/weakness (64 %), fever and night sweats (50 %), back pain (38 %) and jaundice (31 %). Swelling of the head of the pancreas with heterogeneous attenuation echo was detected with ultrasound in 75 % (12/16). CT scan showed pancreatic mass with heterogeneous hypodensity focus in all patients, with calcification in 56 % (9/16) patients, and peripancreatic nodules in 38 % (6/16) patients. Anemia and lymphocytopenia were seen in 50 % (8/16) patients, and pancytopenia occurred in 13 % (2/ 16) patients. Hypertransaminasemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP) and GGT were seen in 56 % (9/16) patients. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 69 % (11/16) cases. Granulomas were found in 75 % (12/16) cases, and in 38 % (6/16) cases caseous necrosis tissue was found. Laparotomy was performed in 75 % (12/16) cases, and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) was done in 63 % (10 of 16). The most commonly used combinations of medications were isoniazid/rifampin/streptomycin (63 %, n=10) and isoniazid/rifampin pyrazinamide/streptomycin or ethambutol (38 %, n=6). The duration of treatment lasted for half or one year and treatment was successful in all cases. The characteristics of 58 cases from Chinese literature were also summarized. Conclusion: Tuberculosis of the pancreas and peripancreatic lymph nodes should be considered as a diagnostic possibility in patients presenting with a pancreatic mass, and diagnosis without laparotomy is possible if only doctors are aware of its clinical features and investigate it with appropriate modalities. Pancreatic tuberculosis can be effectively cured by antituberculous drugs.},

abstract={Aim: To construct and express a humanized M2 autoantigen trimer designated as BPO and to apply it in the diagnosis of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Methods: cDNA fragments encoding M2-reactive epitopes of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E2 (PDC-E2), branched chain 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complex E2 (BCOADC-E2) and 2-oxo-glutarate dehydrogenase complex E2 (OGDC-E2) were amplified with PCR using total RNA extracted from human peripheral mononuclear blood cells. The fragments were cloned into the plasmid vector pQE-30 and then transferred into E. coli M15 (pREP4) for expression, which was induced by isopropylthio-β-D-galactoside. The expressed recombinant BPO protein was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE, Western-blotting and Immunoabsorption test, its antigenic reactivity and specificity were identified with seven M2-positive sera confirmed at Euroimmun Research Center (Germany). Using the purified BPO, M2 antibodies in sera from patients with PBC and other liver related diseases were detected with ELISA. Results: The expressed BPO was observed with both antigenic reactivity and specificity of M2 autoantigens. The determination of M2 antibodies by BPO with ELISA was more sensitive than using the Euroimmun's kit with the coefficients of variation less than 10 % in both interassay and intraassay. With the newly established method, M2 antibodies were found in 100 % (20/20) of patients with PBC. Six cases of liver disease with unknown etiology and 1 patient with drug induced liver injury had detectable levels of serum M2 antibodies. There were also 2 patients with autoimmune cholangitis and 1 with autoimmune hepatitis showing M2-antibody positive. Conclusion: Compared with the routine immunofluorescence assay and commercially available assay kit using porcine heart mitochondrial protein as the antigen, the detection system established in the present study shows higher sensitivity and specificity and may be used as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of PBC.},

abstract={Tuberculosis is still one of the most important cause of mortality and morbidity in many countries and there is a need for new methods for accurate and rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we have evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in adult patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative and new cases of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. We investigated the relationship between characteristic of the patients, radiological extension of the disease, sputum smear grade, presence of cavity, body-mass index (BMI), serum albumin level, total delay time and PCR positivity. Forty patients (33 male and 7 female; mean age 37.8±14.1) and 20 healthy control subjects (13 male and 7 female; mean age 35.6±7.3) were enrolled in this study. PCR was positive in 16 of 40 (40%) patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and negative in 24 of 40 (60%). None of the healthy controls had positive PCR results. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the PCR assay was 40,100 and 60%, respectively. We found the positive correlation between PCR positivity and sputum smear grade (r= 0.46, P=0.003), radiological extension of the disease (r= 0.69, P=0.001), presence of cavity (r= 0.90, P=0.001). We conclude that the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA from peripheral blood by PCR technique is useful for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis patients with HIV-negative. Hematogenous dissemination was important in tuberculosis patients and peripheral blood samples were suitable and easy materials. However, standardization of the PCR method must be ensured for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Hepatic tuberculosis has been reported in normal and immunocompromised hosts. However, have found no published comparisons between these two groups of subjects with hepatic tuberculosis have been found. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, radiologic features and pathological findings of hepatic tuberculosis in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Method: The authors reviewed retrospectively 20 patients with hepatic tuberculosis admitted between January 1993 and October 2000 to Chulalongkorn University Hospital, Thailand. There were 12 immunocompromised patients (10 HIV-infected males, 1 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) male, 1 SLE female) and 8 immunocompetent patients (6 males, 2 females). The clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, radiologic features and pathological findings were compared between these 2 groups. The diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) was the combination of a demonstrated organism in hemo- or specimen culture, histopathology (positive acid fast bacilli) and rapid identification of M. tb from nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assay based on amplification of the IS 6110 insertion sequences. Results: The clinical features were similar in both groups with fever, weight loss and hepatomegaly as the main manifestations. The biochemical findings were also similar but the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was significantly higher in the immunocompromised group (p < 0.001). Hepatomegaly and diffuse increased echogenicity were common in both groups. Ascitis and calcifications were found more commonly in the immunocompetent subjects, although the differences were not statistically significant. Non-caseating granuloma without detection of acid fast bacilli was a common finding in both groups. The nested PCR assay increased the sensitivity from 49 per cent to 86 per cent compared to the regular PCR assay but specificity was 100 per cent in both techniques. The mortality was significantly higher in immunocompetent patients (p < 0.05) due to the extreme age and severe coexisting diseases. Conclusion: Fever, weight loss, hepatomegaly, disproportionate elevation of ALP and reverse A/G ratio were common in hepatic tuberculosis. A disproportionate elevation of ALP was significantly higher in the immunocompromised hosts. Nested PCR assay showed good sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of this disease.},

abstract={Paratuberculosis (Ptbc) has a high prevalence in Argentina, that affects dairy and beef cattle. The culture is the gold standard to the diagnosis of the disease. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis), the aetiological agent, is difficult to isolate and grow in culture. In this study, 24 randomly selected cows of the Fresian breed from a dairy herd with a history of Ptbc were used to evaluate the performance of different diagnostic techniques. These animals did not show clinical signs of the disease. However, another animal from this herd presented evidence of clinical disease at the moment of the present study. This animal was necropsied and one strain of M. paratuberculosis was isolated from faeces, lymph nodes and intestine. Serum for indirect absorbed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) tests and whole blood samples to perform gamma interferon (γIFN) release assays were obtained from each animal. Faeces and milk samples to carry out bacteriological cultures, PCR identification of M. paratuberculosis, and direct examinations of smears with Ziehl-Neelsen's (ZN) stain were also collected. Tuberculin test with bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) in the caudal fold was performed. The results showed that 10 out of 24 animals (41.6%) were positive to ELISA. Eight strains of M. paratuberculosis were isolated, six from faeces, two from milk. Five of the animals that excreted the bacteria through faeces were ELISA-positive, whereas the excreters through milk were negative to ELISA. No positive samples by AGID were obtained in clinical asymptomatic animals. Seven samples gave positive γIFN results with avian PPD, but only two of these animals were confirmed with culture. Direct PCR, to detect IS900 (M. paratuberculosis) in faeces and milk samples, was negative, but PCR using material taken from faecal and milk cultures gave positive results before visualizing the colonies. No sample was positive by PCR directed to IS6110 (M. tuberculosis complex). There was not always agreement between isolations and ZN in the studied samples. In conclusion, the absorbed ELISA was useful to detect positive animals and excreters through faeces but not through milk. PCR applied to cultures with incipient development before the visualization of colonies was effective to specifically determine the presence of M. paratuberculosis. The γIFN test was not able to detect the most positive animals confirmed by culture. The importance of using ELISA and cultures is emphasized by this study but it is necessary to continue with the γIFN test development for early detection of the disease.},

abstract={Background: The diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis (TP) may be difficult and elusive. The present study was designed to demonstrate the diagnostic usefulness of a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, specific for the IS6110 insertion element of M. tuberculosis complex, in patients with ascites who were suspected of having TP in order to achieve a more timely diagnosis and treatment. Methods: Three HIV-negative patients suffering from fever and ascites were evaluated for suspected TP. Specimens were obtained from ascitic fluid, bone marrow, and peripheral blood and analyzed by both conventional methods and nested PCR for the presence of bacilli. Response to antituberculous treatment was considered as the final criterion for diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis. Results: All three patients had an excellent response to antituberculous therapy. Our PCR-based protocol detected M. tuberculosis complex DNA in the ascitic fluid of all patients, whereas conventional methods failed to establish the disease. Furthermore, in one patient, M. tuberculosis was also detected in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. Conclusions: PCR amplification of the IS6110 sequence of M. tuberculosis complex in ascitic fluid is a useful tool when peritoneal tuberculosis is suspected. However, its validity still needs to be established. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A commercially available enzyme immunoassay developed to detect antibodies to a tuberculosis-associated glycolipid antigen was evaluated for serologic diagnosis of tuberculosis. This was a multicenter study comparing the assay with other methods in 78 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and in 54 controls with non-tuberculous lung diseases. Sensitivities were highest for sputum culture (91.0%), followed by immunoassay (79.5%), nucleic acid amplification (77.3%), and finally acid-fast staining of sputum smear (60.3%). Immunoassay and amplification, both rapid methods, had similarly high sensitivity in smear-positive subjects (89.4 and 88.9%, respectively); in smear-negative subjects these two techniques showed low sensitivity (64.5 and 60.0%, respectively). Concordance between the two methods was relatively low (72.0%). With regard to specificity, seven out of ten patients with old tuberculosis had positive result by immunoassay (30% specificity). In the control group, 10 out of 54 patients had positive immunoassay result (72.2% specificity), with notably limited specificity in the elderly. The tuberculous glycolipid assay is a rapid method sufficiently sensitive for detection of tuberculosis infection, even in smear-negative patients.},

abstract={We report the case of a 52 year-old woman who was re-admitted to regular hemodialysis treatment because of chronic rejection of a renal transplant. She had received her mother's kidney 17 years before and had been treated for a long time with steroids, cyclosporin and azathioprine. In the last two months, fever had occurred, and persisted with the start of hemodialysis. She was admitted to our nephrology unit. Clinical, laboratory, radiological and endoscopic investigations did not lead to a precise diagnosis and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy failed. Some days later, a clear clinical picture of acute abdomen arose and at laparatomy a perforated jejunal ulcer was found. Histological investigation revealed caseous necrosis around the ulcer. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain showed a number of acid-fast resistant bacilli. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Specific therapy was started, but nevertheless the patient died a few days later, of septic shock. Our case shows that tuberculosis continues to be a significant, severe clinical problem in transplant recipients and is in fact still an important cause of death in these patients. The possibility of tuberculosis must be taken into account when a transplant patient shows fever and severe abdominal trouble with no clear evidence of another infection.},

abstract={The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers a sensitive and specific way of detecting microbial DNA in clinical samples. The aims of the present study were to develop an assay, based on a single-tube, nested PCR, for identifying Brucella in samples of human blood and then to explore the use of this test in diagnosis. The primers chosen were derived from IS711, the insertion sequence gene found in all species of Brucella. The assay amplified a 52-bp final product which was detected colorimetrically. The PCR was sensitive and specific, giving positive reactions with 14 strains of Brucella from five species. The lower limit of detection in vitro was 30 organisms. There were no false-positive reactions either with a range of bacteria known to evoke serological cross-reactions with Brucella (Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli K12) or with organisms producing similar clinical syndromes (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhi). The results of a preliminary field trial of the assay in Kuwait indicate that the assay may be a valuable technique in the diagnosis of human brucellosis, meriting further study with larger numbers of cases. All 28 subjects with brucellosis (diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical features and confirmed by positive serology and, in three cases, by positive blood cultures) were PCR-positive whereas 28 healthy controls and 28 patients with febrile illness attributable to infections other than brucellosis were PCR-negative.},

METHODS: Twelve cases of AIDS associated PCP confirmed by sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were analyzed. RESULTS: Tuberculosis was found in 4 cases and pneumonia in 1 case of PCP. Sputum PCR was positive in all the 12 cases, of them blood PCR was positive in 9, Gomori methenamine silver stain (GMS) positive in 5 and Giemsa stain positive in 6 cases. The CD(4)(+) lymphocyte count was (5 approximately 155) x 10(6)/L, with a mean of (51 +/- 48) x 10(6)/L; the number of CD(4)(+) cells less than 100 x 10(6)/L in 10 cases (83%) with 9 cases (75%) less than 50 x 10(6)/L. The CD(4)(+)/CD(8)(+) ratio was 0.01 approximately 0.29. CONCLUSIONS: PCP was common in patients with advanced AIDS and often co-infected with other opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis. A diagnosis of PCP should be considered if sputum PCR is positive and typical clinical manifestations are present in patients with AIDS.},

abstract={Because of the frequent exposure of cattle to mycobacteria of the avium/intracellulare group, an investigation was carried out into the possible repercussions thereof on the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. Three calves from a bovine tuberculosis-free herd, scored avian reactors in the γ-interferon assay for bovine tuberculosis, were sedated and inoculated endotracheally with a virulent Mycobacterium bovis strain. Then, three other avian reactors were housed with the above donor calves. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the nasal swabs of the three endotracheally infected, donor calves. On these samples, TB complex-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for IS6110 were also positive, albeit with a different time kinetics. The three contact-infected calves showed clear immunological signs of infection; however, their nasal swabs were always PCR-negative and only Mycobacterium avium was isolated. In the endotracheally infected donor calves there was a rise of the γ-interferon responses to avian and bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculins, which reached the same stable plateau levels over the whole experiment. The above effect was also observed in the contact-infected calves, even though the response to avian PPD tuberculin always remained at a higher level. By using conventional bovine and avian PPD tuberculins, the comparative intradermal test was generally positive in endotracheally infected, as opposed to contact-infected calves; a positive intradermal test for M. bovis was obtained in two contact-infected calves by different bovine PPD tuberculins based on M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) secreted or somatic antigens. It was concluded that M. bovis infection may be concealed for some time in cattle sensitized by mycobacteria of the avium/intracellulare group and that different diagnostic procedures should be adopted for such animals.},

abstract={Diagnosis of tuberculosis is time-consuming and requires infrastructures which are often not available in countries with high incidences of the disease. In the present study, an 82-kDa protein antigen was isolated by affinity chromatography and was identified by peptide mass fingerprinting as isocitrate dehydrogenase II, which is encoded by the icd2 gene of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The icd2 gene of BCG was cloned by PCR, and the product of recombinant gene expression was purified and analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant protein, named rICD2, was tested for its recognition by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from the sera of 16 patients with tuberculosis (TB) and 23 healthy individuals by Western blotting. The results showed that rICD2 is recognized by IgG antibodies from the sera of all TB patients tested at serum dilutions of ≥1:640. At a serum dilution of 1:1,280, the sensitivity was 50% and the specificity was 86.9%. These results indicate that rICD2 might represent a candidate for use in a new assay for the serodiagnosis of TB.},

abstract={A 31-years-old man suffered from cough, sputum, slight fever, and loss of consciousness. He was tentatively diagnosed as epilepsy, and was transferred to our hospital. Brain CT demonstrated multiple intracranial lesions, which were homogeneously enhanced. Chest X-ray revealed retiform shadow in the right middle lung field. Pulmonary tuberculosis and intracranial tuberculomas were suspected and bacterial cultures, PCR, smear examination of sputum, blood, CSF, gastric juice, and urine were repeated. But no evidence of tuberculosis was obtained. Follow-up CT after 5 days of admission showed exacerbation of intracranial lesions. Finally, the open brain biopsy was carefully done from the right occipital lesion. The histological examination disclosed a typical pathology of tuberculoma and PCR also turned out to be positive from the brain tissue. We diagnosed him as intracranial tuberculoma and anti-tuberculous drugs (isoniazid, cthambutol, pyrazinamide) were administered. After 30 days under the medication, brain CT demonstrated a transient expansion of the intracranial le-sions. While the same therapy was sustained, intracranial lesions gradually decreased and he discharged after 60 days of admission. Brain CT is known as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of intracranial tuberculoma. Its sensitivity is almost 100%, but some clinical reports have described that its specificity is not always so high(20-71%) as expected. In addition, it should be recognized that intracranial tuberculoma might show 'paradoxical expan-sion'. It is a phenomenon, which shows a paradoxical worsening in clinical aspect despite of the appropriate therapy. In such a progressing case as ours, it is desirable to make a definite diagnosis before anti-tuberculous drug is started. Therefore, it is recommended in possible cases to even consider the open brain biopsy from the early period when intracranial tuberculoma is highly suspected.},

abstract={Nucleic acid amplification technologies offer great promise for the rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, the isolation of inhibitor-free DNA from biological specimens is a bottleneck of the PCR assay. Here we describe a simple method for the isolation of PCR-amplifiable DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from all types of samples of pulmonary and extrapulmonary origin tested. Briefly, it involves concentration of the bacilli by high-speed centrifugation, removal of PCR inhibitors by a wash solution containing guanidinium isothiocyanate and the release of bacterial DNA by heating in the presence of detergents and Chelex-100 resin. The entire process is accomplished within ∼3 h. The method has been validated on 780 samples of human, bovine and guinea pig origin including sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, pulmonary fluids, pus, fine needle aspirate, tissue, blood and milk. © 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

abstract={In order to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a PCR assay for patients with focal complications of brucellosis, we studied by PCR and by conventional microbiological techniques 34 nonblood samples from 32 patients with different focal forms of brucellosis. The samples from patients with brucellosis were paired to an equal number of control samples from the same locations of patients whose illnesses had different etiologies. Thirty-three of the 34 nonblood samples (97%) from the brucellosis patients were positive by PCR, whereas Brucella spp. were isolated from only 29.4% of the conventional cultures. For 11.4% of the patients, the confirmatory serological tests were either negative or showed titers below the diagnostic range. Two patients (6.2%) from the control group, both with tuberculous vertebral osteomyelitis, had a positive PCR result. The brucella PCR of blood from these two patients was also positive, and the two strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated were analyzed by the brucella PCR, with no evidence of amplification. These results show that the PCR assay is far more sensitive than conventional cultures, and this, coupled with its speed and reduction in risk to laboratory workers, makes this technique a very useful tool for the diagnosis of focal complications of brucellosis.},

abstract={SETTING: Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical relevance of detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. DESIGN: Single-centre prospective case study of 90 hospitalised patients and 50 healthy subjects or blood donors from 1 January to 30 June 1998. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis (26.7%); 20 tuberculosis patients were culture-positive, with seven smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli. Sensitivity of smear, culture and nested PCR was 30.4 (7/23), 87 (20/23) and 30.4% (7/23), respectively. The specificity of smear and culture was 100%, and the specificity of the nested PCR was 96% in the healthy subjects. However, the specificity decreased to 83.6% in the hospitalised patients, with 11 nested PCR-positive patients without a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The sensitivity of the nested PCR was low in pulmonary tuberculosis (22.2%), but increased in pulmonary/extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (50%), extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (33%), and disseminated tuberculosis (33%). CONCLUSION: The use of a nested PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis with regard to low sensitivity and specificity. However, further studies are needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of paucibacillary forms of tuberculosis.},

abstract={Pancreatic tuberculosis in an HIV seropositive patient. A 34-year-old man from Nigeria who had resided permanently in the Netherlands for five years had experienced fever, upper abdominal pain and weight loss for several months. He did not give the impression of being ill. A CT scan gave cause to suspect pancreatitis. An HIV test gave a positive result. Puncture of the accumulated fluid around the pancreas led to the diagnosis 'tuberculosis' (infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Once the patient had made a good recovery with antituberculosis therapy, antiretroviral therapy was initiated, whereupon the number of CD4- cells in the blood increased. Extra-pulmonal tuberculosis is not unusual in HIV seropositive patients from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. However, in such patients isolated tuberculosis of the pancreas is unusual and has not previously been described in the Netherlands. The diagnosis can be established following a CT guided puncture; tuberculosis is instantly suspected if the Ziehl-Neelsen stains are positive and the diagnosis can then be confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and by culturing. Anti-retroviral therapy is withheld until response to anti-tuberculosis treatment is satisfactory.},

abstract={We have developed a PCR assay that is capable of amplifying kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) of Leishmania donovani in a species-specific manner among Old World leishmanias. With Indian strains and isolates of L. donovani the assay was sensitive enough to detect kDNA in an amount equivalent to a single parasite or less. The extreme sensitivity of the assay was reflected in its ability to detect parasite DNA from small volumes of peripheral blood of patients with kala-azar (KA) and from skin lesions from patients with post-KA dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). A total of 107 clinical leishmaniasis samples were analyzed. Of these 102 (95.3%) were positive by PCR. The test provided a diagnosis of KA with 96% sensitivity using patient whole-blood samples instead of bone marrow or spleen aspirates that are obtained by invasive procedures. The assay was also successful in the diagnosis of 45 of 48 PKDL cases (93.8%). Cross-reactions with pathogens prevalent in the area of endemicity, viz., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and Plasmodium spp., could be ruled out. Eighty-one control samples, including dermal scrapings from healthy portions of skin from patients with PKDL were all negative. Two of twenty controls from the area of endemicity were found positive by PCR assay; however, there was a good possibility that these two were asymptomatic carriers since they were serologically positive for KA. Thus, this PCR assay represents a tool for the diagnosis of KA and PKDL in Indian patients in a noninvasive manner, with simultaneous species identification of parasites in clinical samples.},

abstract={Purpose. To demonstrate the difficulties of the differential diagnosis between tuberculosis and sarcoidosis as the cause of posterior uveitis. Case reports. A 56-year-old woman suffered from bilateral anterior uveitis, snowball like infiltrates in the vitreous, and peripheral retinochoroidal granulomas with marked exudation shown in fluorescein angiography. Angiotensin-converting enzyme, as a marker of sarcoidosis, was elevated; the tuberculin test, however, was negative. Chest X-ray revealed an infiltrate and numerous smaller granulomas. The presumptive diagnosis was sarcoidosis. Surprisingly, in the biopsy of the pulmonal lesion tubercle bacilli were detected by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Thus, a diagnosis of pulmonal and also retinochoroidal tuberculosis was made. After tuberculostatic therapy the choroidal lesions healed off. In a second case, a 30-year-old man suffered from bilateral panuveitis with candle wax exudates near the retinal vessels. Chest X-ray revealed lymphomas in the hilus,and the lymph node biopsy showed granulomas with epitheloid cells, indicating sarcoidosis. Detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis by culture or histological criteria was negative. Only in the PCR was mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA detectable. Tuberculostatic therapy had no benefit. Under therapy with steroids, however, pulmonal and ophthalmologic findings rapidly disappeared. Conclusion. The difficult differential diagnosis between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis cannot always be made by laboratory tests or diagnostic imaging alone. Clinical manifestations, including response to therapy, are essential.},

abstract={Background: Inflammation of retinal vessels is a known association of systemic tuberculosis. Patients with retinal vasculitis are subjected to extensive but unrewarding systemic workup. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is now commonly used to detect DNA of infective organisms including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This study was undertaken to characterize the clinical characteristics of PCR-positive tubercular retinal vasculitis, so as to determine the clinical presentation, associated systemic features, management, and course of this form of vasculitis. Methods: The clinical records of 13 patients seen between 1997 and 1999 with the diagnosis of PCR-positive tubercular retinal vasculitis from the aqueous or vitreous humor were reviewed. Recorded data included age, sex, race, visual acuity, anterior and posterior segment findings, and results of diagnostic evaluations. All received antituberculosis therapy with or without concomitant corticosteroids. Laser scatter photocoagulation was done in eyes with neovascularization. One eye with vitreous hemorrhage was subjected to pars plana vitrectomy. Results: There were 9 (69.2%) male and 4 (30.7%) female patients with a median age of 20 years. The disease was bilateral in seven. The most consistent finding was the presence of vitritis in all the eyes followed by vitreous snowball opacities in 17 eyes (89.4%), neovascularization in 11 eyes (57.8%), retinal hemorrhages in 10 eyes (52.6%), neuroretinitis in 10 eyes (52.6%), focal choroiditis in 9 eyes (47.3%), vitreous/preretinal hemorrhage in 5 eyes (26.3%), and serous retinal detachment in 3 eyes (15.7%). Over a median follow-up of 12 months, all showed resolution of vasculitis with no recurrences. Conclusions: Polymerase chain reaction-positive tubercular retinal vasculitis had varied associated fundus findings. Its recognition is important so as to order only relevant diagnostic tests.},

abstract={Objectives. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) constitutes the main cause of classic fever of unknown origin (FUO) in many populations. The aim of this study was to improve the diagnostic field of the disease using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, specific for the IS6110 insertion element of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, in order to achieve a more timely diagnosis and treatment. Setting. Twenty-four, HIV-negative classic FUO patients who were admitted to the Regional Hospital of Alexandroupolis between April 1997 and July 1999. Subjects and design. The above patients were considered as putative extrapulmonary TB after 3 weeks of in-patient investigation and underwent exhaustive examination for diagnosis of the disease. For this purpose, specimens were obtained from peripheral blood and bone marrow from these patients, as well as from damaged tissues, and analysed by both PCR and conventional methods. Anti-tuberculous treatment was initiated in 16 out of 24 patients and the response to this regimen was considered as the final criterion for diagnosis of tuberculosis. Results. Extrapulmonary TB was established in 11 patients. The PCR-based methodology, when applied to samples derived from bone marrow aspirations and suspected damaged tissues, was able to diagnose 10 of them, whereas the conventional methods were able to detect only two. Conclusions. Our results confirm the diagnostic value of molecular detection of M. tuberculosis in cases of FUO, thus supporting the application of PCR in tissue samples suspected of bacillus infection. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that bone marrow aspiration specimens constitute an alternative, easy, safe and reliable source for such PCR analysis.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical significance of the Amplicor Mycobacterium system for the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection in patients with pleural fluid, and to compare its usefulness with that of conventional smear and culture methods. DESIGN: Pleural fluid specimens were obtained randomly from in-patients admitted to National Tokyo Hospital between January and December 1996. All the patients were diagnosed with bacterial, histopathological and clinical gold standard. The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of mycobacterial infection were evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-five pleural fluid specimens were obtained. Conventional methods demonstrated a sensitivity of 30.6% and a specificity of 100%, while the Amplicor Mycobacterium demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 27.3% and 97.6% respectively. Lactic dehydrogenase, carcinoembryonic antigen, red blood cell, protein, glucose and types of inflammatory cells were not different in Amplicor positive and negative pleural fluid with mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSION: There was not much improvement in the accuracy of diagnosis when Amplicor Mycobacterium was used to diagnose mycobacterial pleuritis among various diseases with pleural fluid; however, the assay time was dramatically reduced with the use of Amplicor Mycobacterium.},

Laboratory investigations revealed among others a moderately increased CRP-value, normal sedimentation rate and, initially, a normal white cell count. The differential diagnosis included neoplastic and infectious diseases (i. e. endocarditis, tuberculosis), endocrinopathies (i. e. thyreoditis) and general inflammatory or rheumatic diseases. An initially increased CMV-IgM-titer, a rising anti CMV IgG-titer and gradually developing atypical lymphocytosis in particular suggested diagnosis of severe CMV-infection. The diagnosis was confirmed by PCR positive for CMV-DNA in blood. The course of a CMV-primary infection may develop from asymptomatic infection over a mononucleosis-like syndrome to disseminated CMV-infection with multi organ involvement. © Verlag Hans Huber, 2000.},

The specimens of sputum were also detected by smear, culture with BACTEC and Lowenstein-Jensen for comparison. RESULTS: The positive rates of sputum and peripheral blood detected by TaqMan-PCR were 53.0% and 61.3%, respectively, significantly higher than those of PCR, smear, culture with BACTEC and Lowenstein-Jensen (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between TaqMan-PCR and PCR for specificity (P > 0.05). Of 105 specimens of peripheral blood from patients with smear-negative and culture-negative pulmonary tuberculosis, 48 specimens of peripheral blood detected by TaqMan-PCR were positive. The positive rate was 45.7%. CONCLUSIONS: TaqMan-PCR method showed higher sensitivity and specificity.

abstract={We have developed a simple, economical and reproducible method for processing blood samples from HIV infected patients for diagnosis of tuberculosis. The procedure was validated on 55 samples selected for tuberculosis based on clinical criteria. 52 patients had radiological changes indicative of pulmonary tuberculosis of which only 28 were positive for AFB in sputum (sensitivity 54%) and 27 for tuberculin (sensitivity 52%). 26 HIV positive patients who showed positive X-ray did not react to tuberculin. The genus PCR probe missed 3 samples (sensitivity 94%) compared to X-ray. M.tuberculosis was detected in the blood of all X-ray positive cases by PCR using TB400 probe (sensitivity 100%) and another probe for Af. tuberculosis, IS6110, missed 6 of them (sensitivity 88% compared to X-ray and 89% compared to TB400). It is proposed that this simple sample processing method could be used to screen all blood samples quickly for mycobacteremia using the genus PCR and only those positive for mycobacteria need to be tested for M. tuberculosis. This would save the scarce resources and time by reducing significantly the number of samples to be screened for species confirmation.},

The gold standard comparison was a clinically based final case definition of tuberculosis corresponding to group 3 of the American Thoracic Society's classification system. The sensitivities of stain, culture and PCR were 41%, 65% and 59%, respectively. Overall specificity exceeded 97% for all techniques. The combination of PCR and direct stain achieved a sensitivity similar to that of culture alone. The PCR method detected 74 of 95 (78%) culture-positive results. In a hospital setting, PCR could be a useful, reliable tool for diagnosis of tuberculosis and may be introduced as a complementary routine diagnostic laboratory method.},

The yield and clinical utility of a combination of diagnostic tests were prospectively studied among 500 consecutive patients referred for sputum induction for diagnosis of possible active TB. Patients underwent sputum induction, chest X-ray, tuberculin testing, and had blood drawn for serologic testing (Detect-TB test; Biochem ImmunoSystems). Sputum was examined with fluorescent microscopy and PCR (Amplicor MTB-Roche) and cultured for mycobacteria using liquid (BACTEC) and solid media. For the diagnosis of the 60 cases of active TB, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of the following diagnostic tests were mycobacterial culture, 73% and 100%; PCR, 42% and 100%; chest X-ray, 67-77% and 66-76%; tuberculin testing, 94% and 20%; and serology, 33% and 87%. After consideration of PCR and radiographic and clinical characteristics, a positive serologic test was independantly associated with diagnosis of active disease (adjusted odds of disease if positive, 2.6; 95% confidence limits, 1.1,6.1). No currently available test has sensitivity and specificity high enough for the accurate diagnosis of minimal pulmonary TB. Utilization of a combination of tests, together with consideration of key clinical characteristics, could improve diagnostic accuracy.},

abstract={Study objectives: Pleural tuberculosis (TB) is a diagnostic challenge because of its nonspecific clinical presentation and paucibacillary nature. The inefficiency of conventional laboratory methods and the reliance on pleural biopsy have motivated the evaluation of alternative diagnostic strategies. We have evaluated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directed to the IS6110 sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the determination of adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity, and measurement of interferon (IFN)-γ levels in pleural fluid in the diagnosis of pleural TB. Patients: ADA activity, IFN-γ levels, and PCR were evaluated in 140 cases of pleural effusion, 42 with confirmed pleural TB, 19 with probable pleural TB, 70 with a nontuberculous etiology, and 9 having an undetermined etiology. Results: ADA activity, IFN-γ levels, and PCR were 88%, 85.7%, and 73.8% sensitive, respectively, and 85.7%, 97.1%, and 90% specific, respectively, for pleural TB that had been confirmed by either culture or pleural biopsy specimens. The combination of PCB, IFN-γ measurement, and ADA activity determination allowed the selective increase of sensitivity and specificity for probable and confirmed cases compared to individual methods. Positive and negative predictive values for these individual or combined methods were maintained over a wide range of prevalence of pleural TB in the patient population presenting with pleural effusions. Fever and younger age were associated with tuberculous pleural effusion (p < 0.0001), while blood in sputum and older age were associated with malignant etiology (p < 0.008). Conclusions: These clinical variables together with the use of ADA activity determination, PCR, and measurement of IFN-γ levels provide the basis for the rapid and efficient diagnosis of pleural TB in different clinical settings.},

The patient was first treated with parenteral unspecific antibiotherapy. Microbiological studies of blood and CSF were negative. CSF examination with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Clinical (pain and fever) symptoms and CSF abnormalities decreased after antituberculous treatment. However, paraparesis remain severe. Spinal tuberculous localizations often lead to diagnostic and therapeutic errors. Improvement of spinal cord MRI sequences and using of PCR technics in CSF would contribute to reduce these difficulties.},

Peroperative observation of the ascites, with multiple sites of adhesion, and pathological examination of the hepatic nodule and peritoneum confirmed initial diagnosis. Antituberculous treatment was given for one year. A second laparoscopic procedure was performed and found no disease remaining. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.},

abstract={Purpose: The aim of this study was to detect mycobacteremia by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), induced by the instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) to guinea pig bladder. We also investigated the peak time and the effect of the dose of BCG in injured and non-injured bladder. The sensitivities of routine culture and PCR were also compared. Materials and Methods: Five different doses (0, 0.069, 0.69, 6.9 and 69 mg.) of BCG were instilled into 5 injured and 5 non-injured bladders. Blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes following instillation for routine culture and PCR for each dose. A total of 50 female guinea pigs were used. Results: Three of 5 samples (60%) obtained 30 minutes after the instillation of 69 mg. BCG into injured bladders were PCR positive. Furthermore, 4 of 5 samples (80%) were PCR positive when samples were obtained at the 60th minute following instillation. All the other samples were negative for PCR and routine culture. All the routine tuberculosis culture results were negative, including those which were PCR positive. Conclusions: Mycobacteremia was detected only in injured bladders and with high doses of BCG. PCR is a highly sensitive and rapid diagnostic method for detection of mycobacteremia.},

abstract={Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis is emerging as the most important disease affecting cattle. Furthermore, it results in a major public health problem when transmitted to humans. Due to its difficult and non-specific diagnosis, M. bovis has been declared to be one of the etiologic agents causing significant economic loss in the cattle industry. Our group evaluated a more rapid and specific method, based on a new polymerase chain reaction species-specific primers, which amplifies a 470-base pair fragment of the M. bovis genome. A total of 275 milk-producing cows were studied by intradermal tuberculin test (ITT) which gave 184 positive and 91 negative cases. From them, 50 animals were taken from a cattle ranch free of tuberculosis. Three different samples were collected from each animal (blood, nasal mucus, and milk). Positive results were obtained from 26 animals by PCR (11.4%), 1 by bacteriological culturing (0.4%) and 1 by bacilloscopy (0.4%). This finding suggests, as in previous reports, that ITT, normally used for bovine tuberculosis detection, has the inconvenience of having a broad range of specificity and sensitivity, and the PCR technique is a more specific and sensitive test to detect infection associated with M. bovis. Therefore, we propose this PCR assay as a useful tool in the epidemiological characterization of infected animals in areas considered to be at high risk of transmission.},

abstract={Mycobacterium avium is the causative agent of the avian mycobacteriosis commonly known as avian tuberculosis (ATB). This infection causes disseminated disease, is difficult to diagnose, and is of serious concern because it causes significant mortality in birds. A new method was developed for processing specimens for an antemortem screening test for ATB. This novel method uses the zwitterionic detergent C18-carboxypropylbetaine (CB-18). Blood, bone marrow, bursa, and fecal specimens from 28 ducks and swabs of 20 lesions were processed with CB-18 for analysis by smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Postmortem examination confirmed nine of these birds as either positive or highly suspect for disseminated disease. The sensitivities of smear, culture, and PCR, relative to postmortem analysis and independent of specimen type, were 44.4%, 88.9%, and 100%, respectively, and the specificities were 84.2%, 57.9%, and 15.8%, respectively. Reductions in specificity were due primarily to results among fecal specimens. However, these results were clustered among a subset of birds, suggesting that these tests actually identified birds in early stages of the disease. Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping identified one strain of M. avium (serotype 1) that was isolated from lesions, bursa, bone marrow, blood, and feces of all but three of the culture-positive birds. In birds with confirmed disease, blood had the lowest sensitivity and the highest specificity by all diagnostic methods. Swabs of lesions provided the highest sensitivity by smear and culture (33.3% and 77.8%, respectively), whereas fecal specimens had the highest sensitivity by PCR (77.8%). The results of this study indicate that processing fecal specimens with CB-18, followed by PCR analysis, may provide a valuable first step for monitoring the presence of ATB in birds.

abstract={Background - Despite the increased dissemination of tuberculosis among HIV infected patients, the diagnosis is difficult to establish. Traditional microbiological methods lack satisfactory sensitivity. We have developed a highly sensitive and specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) capable of detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in urine specimens and have used this test to examine urine specimens from HIV patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods - Urine specimens from 13 HIV infected patients with microbiologically proven active pulmonary tuberculosis, 10 AIDS patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection (documented by blood culture), 53 AIDS patients with no evidence of mycobacterial disease, and 80 healthy subjects (25 with positive skin test to purified protein derivative) were tested for M tuberculosis using PCR, acid fast staining (AFS), and culture. Results - Of the urine specimens from patients with active tuberculosis, all tested positive by PCR, two by culture, and none by AFS. No reactivity was observed in urine specimens from patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection. Of the 53 AIDS patients without mycobacterial infection, one had a positive urine PCR. Normal subjects were all negative. Conclusions - Urine based nested PCR for M tuberculosis may be a useful test for identifying HIV patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.},

abstract={We encountered an autopsy case of renal failure complicated by cerebral tuberculosis. The patient was hospitalized due to disturbance of consciousness, and dialysis therapy was performed because of end-stage renal failure. Approximately 1 week later, abnormal shadows were observed on chest X-ray, and various examinations were performed until the diagnosis was finally determined as miliary tuberculosis. Disturbance of consciousness was exacerbated, despite the administration of antituberculosis drugs and other treatments, and the patient died on the 105th hospital day. Pathological examinations demonstrated miliary tuberculosis associated with intracranial involvement, in addition to contracted kidneys. In patients with end-stage renal failure, the risk of developing tuberculosis, miliary tuberculosis in particular, is reported to be much higher than in normal subjects. However, the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis is difficult to establish, because of nonspecific symptoms and the low rate of detection of acid-fast bacteria from the sputum. Comprehensive understanding of the results of frequent culture examinations of sputum and blood, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cerebrospinal fluid, as well as albumin concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, are considered useful in diagnosing intracranial tuberculosis. Although cerebral tuberculoma is rare, prolonged disturbance of consciousness may be related to cerebral tuberculosis. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to patients with end-stage renal failure complicated by disturbance of consciousness.},

abstract={Background: We analyzed the γδ T cell composition and responses in the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children affected by tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and in control children. Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood and CSF samples were stimulated with different phosphoantigens and IL-2, and expansion of Vγ/Vδ2 T cells assessed by FACS analysis. Vγ9/Vδ2 lines were obtained by culturing CSF or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro with phosphoantigens and IL-2 for 2 months, and tested for proliferation and cytokine production in response to phosphoantigens. Vδ2(D)Jδ junctional sequence length was assessed by PCR. Results: The repertoire of γδ T cells from the CSF of TBM patients was characterized by the predominance of Vγ9/Vδ2 T lymphocytes, which accounted for >80% of γδ T cells. Vγ9/Vδ2 cells from the CSF of TBM children responded to different synthetic and natural (mycobacterial) phosphoantigens and produced discrete amounts of IFN-γ and TNF-α. The in vitro expansion of Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells from CSF and peripheral blood of TBM patients prominently decreased following chemotherapy, and similarly, the proportion of ex vivo unstimulated Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells in CSF of TBM patients decreased to levels detected in the CSF of control subjects. Vδ2 CDR3 TCR analysis showed that the remaining Vδ2 cells in the CSF of TBM patients were still polyclonal. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with an involvement of Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells in TBM.},

abstract={M. tuberculosis L-forms researches done in China during the recent years were reviewed in this article. M. tuberculosis L-forms could be produced spontaneously or induced by isoniazid or D-cyclic serine, that influenced the synthesis of cell walls. Among the acid-fast organisms isolated from the patients, more L-forms were found than vegetative forms. In extrapulmonary tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis disseminated through the blood mainly in L-forms, L-forms could adhere on the surface or harbor inside the red cells. With the loss of cell walls, L-forms of M. tuberculosis lost some of their pathogenic features, specific for diagnosis, e.g. OT reaction remained negative and no tuberculosis tubercles formed. In most of these patients only interstitial inflammation could be seen in different organs, similar to that of virus or mycoplasma infection. Unless acid-fast, immunohistochemical staining or isolation was made, it often led to misdiagnosis in histological examination. According to clinical examinations and animal experiments, M. tuberculosis L-forms were found to be closely related to pulmonary carcinoma, especially in adenocarcinoma L-forms were isolated in 34.38% of the cases. M. tuberculosis L-forms were low in pathogenicity, the diseases caused were often escaped from being noticed. M. tuberculosis L-forms were found in 86% of abnormal feeling in nasopharynx, in 32% of chronic prostatitis. M. tuberculosis L-forms were also found in semen of infertile male, the adhesion of L-forms on the sperms inhibited their motility. M. tuberculosis L-forms grew better and faster in liquid than on solid media. The most sensitive method of detection was the using of immunohistochemical technique. In acid-fast staining IK method was better than ZN method. In compensation to the loss of cell walls, the cell membranes became greatly thickened, that increased the difficulty in DNA extraction for PCR examination.

abstract={In spite of recent advances in diagnosis and chemotherapy of tuberculosis, prognosis of tuberculosis of the central nervous system (CNS) is still poor. We evaluated clinical characteristics of 14 patients with the CNS tuberculosis (10 male and 4 female, 21 to 71 years of age) who were hospitalized at IMCJ from 1988 to 1997. Twelve patients had tuberculous meningitis (2 of them had also intracranial tuberculoma), 1 had intracranial tuberculoma and 1 had spinal cord tuberculosis. For the acid-fast bacilli, the smears of cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) were all negative but the cultures for M. tuberculosis were positive in 5. Using PCR method, M. tuberculosis was identified from CSF specimens in 2 out of 9 culture negative patients, thus suggesting the usefulness of the PCR for the rapid diagnosis of CNS tuberculosis. The adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in CSF may provide another diagnostic clue because they were elevated in 8 out of 10 cases. It is to be noted that there were three patients who developed clinical manifestations of CNS tuberculosis after the initiation of chemotherapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. In the last five cases, four-drug regimen which included PZA, was used with a good result. The success could be related to the addition of PZA which penetrates blood-brain barrier just as good as INH. Two patients died and one remains unconscious with severe neurological sequelae. The present study indicates that positive CSF culture, hydrocephalus and consciousness disturbance are important factors in determining poor prognosis of the CNS tuberculosis.},

abstract={Due to the demographic changes during the last decades there is a growing need to deal with medical problems of the elderly. In the age-group of more than 65 years the risk of acquiring infections and to die of serious complications is substantially higher than in younger people. One of the leading causes of infectious morbidity and mortality is pneumonia. The annual incidence of pneumonias requiring hospitalisation increases from 0.54 cases in the age group from 35 - 44 years to 11.6 cases per 1,000 persons in people over 75 years of age. Atypical presentation of pneumonia in elderly patients delays the initiation of antibiotic therapy and hence increases the risk of a fatal outcome. The most common pathogen in severe pneumonia is Streptococcus penumoniae. Gramnegative bacteria like Haemophilus influence, Moraxella catarrhalis and E. coli are more frequent in the elderly than in younger patients. Another important pathogen is Chlamydia pneumoniae. Viruses are rare except for influenza during epidemics and respiratory syncytial virus. Tuberculosis has always to be included into the diagnostic considerations. The microbiologic diagnosis of pneumonia includes blood and sputum culture and serological investigations for Legionella, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The microbiological diagnosis of tuberculosis is based on microscopical examination and the standardised culture in liquid and on solid media. Amplification methods such as PCR contribute to a rapid diagnosis. According to the spectrum of pathogens β-lactam antibiotics followed by macrolides are the most important antimicrobials for the initial therapy of pneumonia in the elderly. Vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal diseases are significantly preventive measures and should be offered to all elderly people.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA (MTB-DNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. METHOD: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used to amplify gene of 240 bp DNA fragment prepared by Triton X-100 method, and some factors affecting PCR result were also analysed. RESULT: In blood samples of 89 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and in sputum samples of 84 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, the positive rates of PCR were 73% and 57% respectively, and the total positive rate of combinative detection of blood and sputum samples was 87% in 84 pulmonary tuberculosis patients. In 30 non-tuberculosis patients, 3 showed MTB-DNA positive. CONCLUSION: PCR technique prepared by Triton X-100 method is rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive for detection of MTB-DNA in PBMC, and its sensitivity and accuracy could be increased in combination with sputum MTB examination. Detection of MTB-DNA in PMBC is of value in diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.},

abstract={Background: Accurate diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) has been difficult historically, yet a great demand persists for a rapid and reliable diagnostic method. Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis anti-Kp 90 IgA antibodies is one of the more novel techniques. Study objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic value of a recently developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, which detects IgA antibodies against M tuberculosis Kp 90 antigen, and to compare the results with conventional diagnosis and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Participants: Serum, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-blood, and body fluid samples were obtained from 51 patients with active TB and 71 control subjects. The clinical diagnosis of TB was supported by a positive culture (n = 6), detection of acid-fast bacilli on smear (n = 35), or both (n = 10). Measurements and results: IgA antibodies were detected in sera and/or body fluid samples from 82% of patients with TB and 10% of controls. M tuberculosis DNA was detected in body fluid sample of 96% and blood sample of 49% of patients with TB by PCR. None of the blood and 5.6% of the body fluid specimens from controls were PCR-positive. Conclusions: Anti-Kp 90 IgA antibodies were detected using ELISA in 78% of serum and 69% of body fluids from patients with TB, therefore, this test is promising for the diagnosis of active TB and appears to be more reliable, particularly for body fluid samples.},

The elevation of ADA (> 45 U/l) is supportive of the diagnosis. Tuberculous pericarditis is detected clinically either in the effusive stage by nonspecific systemic syndrome or after the development of constrictive pericarditis. The short-course treatment of tuberculous pericarditis should consist of three-drug regimen, such as INH, RFP, PZA, SM, EB. The use of prednisolone is controversial. Tuberculous myocarditis is extremely rare because of low affinity between M. Tuberculosis and myocardium. Most cases of tuberculous pericarditis are clinically silent and diagnosed at autopsy.},

abstract={An easy-to-handle Mycobacterium-specific PCR assay for detection of the presence of a wide range of mycobacterial species in clinical samples was evaluated. The performance of the genus probe was compared with the performance of probes specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium and with that of standard culture. In addition, the utility of an internal control in monitoring amplification inhibitors was studied. Of 545 respiratory and 325 nonrespiratory specimens (a total of 870 specimens), 58 (6.7%) showed the presence of amplification inhibitors, as determined by a negative result for the internal control. Of these 58 specimens, 31 (53%) were stool specimens; other material, even titrate blood after lysis of erythrocytes, did not pose a problem with regard to inhibition of PCR amplification. Eighty-one of the remaining 812 specimens had a positive Mycobacterium culture result. Of these culture-positive specimens, 58 (71.6%) showed a positive result with the Mycobacterium genus-specific probe. Seventy-two samples had a positive result with the Mycobacterium- specific probe but a negative culture result. Of these 72 samples, 26 samples were regarded as true positive, either because the M. tuberculosis- or M. avium-specific probe was also positive at the same time or because other specimens from the same patient taken at the same time were culture positive. The sensitivity of the Mycobacterium-specific probe was 78.5% and the specificity was 93.5%. This study showed that pretesting of clinical specimens for mycobacteria to the genus level with a Mycobacterium-specific probe offers the routine clinical laboratory the possibility of detecting tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria with one test. Furthermore, specimens testing positive with the genus-specific probe can be immediately identified with species specific probes.},

abstract={A 47-year-old Bedouin man presented with an ulcerated nodule of several months' duration on the nape of the neck. The nodule developed on an asymptomatic, slowly growing plaque which appeared during childhood. Physical examination revealed two erythematous plaques covering the posterior and right lateral aspects of the neck. The border of the plaques was soft, circinate, with a reddish-brown color, while the center was slightly erythematous and atrophic. An ulcerated nodule measuring 2 cm was seen on one of the plaques (Fig. 1). Physical examination was unremarkable with no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests, including complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and routine chemistry tests, were all within normal limits. Chest X-ray showed a small calcified perihilar lymph node. The Mantoux test was positive with erythema and induration of 15 mm after 48 h. Biopsy from a plaque showed extensive diffuse granulomatous infiltration throughout the dermis with epithelioid and Langhans giant cells surrounded by mononuclear inflammatory cells. No caseation necrosis was present. Ziehl-Neelsen, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and Giemsa stains were negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria from a skin sample was also negative. Fresh tissue cultures yielded M. tuberculosis after 6 weeks. A biopsy specimen from the ulcerated nodule demonstrated islands of atypical malignant squamous cells invading the dermis, which were compatible with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Fig. 2). The ulcerated nodule was completely excised, and treatment for tuberculosis was initiated with a combination of isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide. Within 3 months of therapy, the patient's lesions resolved, leaving only slightly atrophic hypopigmented scars. A month after the treatment's initiation, an enlarged cervical lymph node was noted showing metastatic SCC on histologic examination. The patient underwent neck dissection and radiation therapy without evidence of any further metastases.},

abstract={The induction of nitric oxide in human monocytes during mycobacterial infection has been a controversial issue. This study describes a comparative evaluation of the colorimetric and fluorometric methods for the detection of NO in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection in human peripheral blood-derived monocytes (PBM) and in U937, a human monocyte- derived cell line. MTB was grown in monocyte cultures in vitro for 7 or 10 days. RPMI 1640 medium, without antibiotics and supplemented with L-arginine, Hepes, 5% human AB serum, and tetrahydrobiopterin was used to support monocyte growth. As early as 72 h after infection, soluble nitrite was detectable in the medium using the fluorometric assay with diaminonaphthalene (DAN). Early induction of NO correlated with an increase in the levels of iNOS mRNA as quantitated by RT-PCR. NO levels increased progressively up to day 10 (PBM) or day 7 (U937), when 150-200 nM/106 cells of soluble nitrite accumulated in cultures, as measured by DAN. Furthermore, monocytes stained positively for human iNOS protein and peroxynitrite after infection with MTB. The induction of NO by MTB was inhibited by four different inhibitors of iNOS enzyme including N-monomethylarginine. Inhibition of NO resulted in the enhancement of the intracellular growth of two of five clinical isolates of MTB. NO released from a donor (S-nitroso-N-penicillamine) also had a direct bacteriostatic effect on the same isolates in broth cultures. MTB strains thus showed a differential susceptibility to intracellular and extracellular NO. In most of these assays, the Greiss reagent was limited by its sensitivity and remained negative for soluble nitrite throughout the 7-10 days of incubation. Thus, the colorimetric method, which is widely used, may give false-negative results in NO assays. This report also demonstrates for the first time that MTB induces mRNA for iNOS, iNOS protein, NO, and peroxynitrite in human monocyte/macrophage cultures.},

abstract={Procedures for the microbiological diagnosis of acute community-acquired pneumonia are based on the expected pathogens. Although a great variety of microorganisms are able to cause community-acquired pneumonia only a few pathogens play an important role in daily practice. The most important investigations are blood cultures and sputum cultures to detect bacteria like pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus as well as antibody tests for Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia. According to anamnesis and clinic presentation tests such as for Legionella or viruses have to be added. Sometimes also rare pathogens have to be considered such as Coxiella burnetii, Leptospira, Hantaviruses, cryptococci or Chlamydia psittaci. The standard procedure for diagnosis of tuberculosis is the microscopical examination and the standardized culture in liquid and on solid media. Amplification methods such as PCR are also useful for a rapid diagnosis. However, the application of amplification procedures alone without culture is not recommended.},

abstract={The relative importance of molecular biology in clinical practice is often underestimated. However, numerous procedures in clinical diagnosis and new therapeutic drugs have resulted from basic molecular research. Furthermore, understanding of the physiological and physiopathological mechanisms underlying several human diseases has been improved by the results of basic molecular research. For example, cloning of the gene encoding leptin has provided spectacular insights into the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the control of food intake and body weight maintenance in man. In cystic fibrosis, the cloning and identification of several mutations in the gene encoding the chloride channel transmembrane regulator (CFTR) have resolved several important issues in clinical practice: cystic fibrosis constitutes a molecular defect of a single gene. There is a strong correlation between the clinical manifestations or the severity of the disease (phenotype) with the type of mutations present in the CFTR gene (genotype). More recently, identification of mutations in the gene encoding a subunit of the renal sodium channel in the Liddle syndrome has provided important insights into the physiopathological understanding of mechanisms involved in this form of hereditary hypertension. Salt retention and secondary high blood pressure are the result of constitutive activation of the renal sodium channel by mutations in the gene encoding the renal sodium channel. It is speculated that less severe mutations in this channel could result in a less severe form of hypertension which may correspond to patients suffering from high blood pressure with low plasma renin activity. Several tools, most notably PCR, are derived from molecular research and are used in everyday practice, i.e. in prenatal diagnosis and in the diagnosis of several infectious diseases including tuberculosis and hepatitis. Finally, the production of recombinant proteins at lower cost and with fewer side effects is used in everyday clinical practice. Gene therapy remains an extraordinary challenge in correcting severe hereditary or acquired diseases. The use of genetically modified animal cell lines producing growth factors, insulin or erythropoietin, which are subsequently encapsulated and transferred to man, represents an attractive approach for gene therapy.},

abstract={A glass matrix was used to purify Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA from clinical samples before amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The procedure was established by analysing a subset of 130 clinical samples (70 from patients with tuberculosis and 60 from patients without tuberculosis). The clinical samples included sputum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and serum. The total number of samples positive by PCR before the glass matrix step was 33 and after the glass matrix step was 58, showing that this purification step improved markedly the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA. The detection limit of the amplified DNA in agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide was 10 CFU for serum and cerebrospinal fluid and 50 CFU for sputum. Once established, the procedure was used in the analysis of 179 additional samples from 133 patients suspected of tuberculosis. In general there was an agreement between the results of PCR and clinical diagnosis for tuberculosis. In the case of sputum samples it was possible to compare the PCR and culture results. When considering all the sputum samples analysed, in general the PCR was slightly less sensitive than the culture test. However, when applied to the analysis of samples from patients suspected of tuberculosis, six samples that were culture negative were positive by PCR. Considering the confirmed results of all clinical samples analysed, the sensitivity of the method described in this work (97.4%) was much higher than culture test (45.5%). This difference was mainly due to the low sensitivity of culture test in cerebrospinal fluid, serum and blood samples. The results presented in this work indicate that the inclusion of the glass matrix step in the preparation of DNA improves the detection of M. tuberculosis in clinical samples.},

The identification of amplification products was confirmed after electrophoresis by hybridisation with a non-isotopic probe in a DNA enzyme immunoassay (DEIA). Of the 30 blood samples studied by the PCR-DEIA technique, 26 gave positive results and four gave negative results. Blood samples from 30 subjects in a control group were negative by this technique.

abstract={Purpose: Following intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillation, we attempted to detect BCG in the blood using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and correlate these findings with the occurrence of major complications due to this treatment. Materials and Methods: Intravesical BCG immunotherapy was given to 22 consecutive patients with superficial bladder tumors. In 2 patients the BCG instillation had to be discontinued due to serious side effects of therapy. Blood samples (252 aliquots) were obtained from 126 BCG courses in 22 cases, and 2 additional samples (4 aliquots) were obtained from 1 patient 1 and 3 months after cessation of therapy. All blood samples were analyzed by the PCR technique for detection of deoxyribonucleic acid tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Results: Of the 126 blood samples 9 (7.1%) were PCR positive for M. tuberculosis. These 9 positive samples belonged to S patients, all of whom were among those 4 patients who had major clinical side effects. Conclusions: We demonstrated that rapid and sensitive detection of mycobacteremia by PCR correlated with the clinical course of these patients. We also demonstrated that PCR can be used to monitor BCG in the blood after antituberculous therapy. The early, fast and accurate diagnosis of BCG in the blood by PCR may alter the serious clinical course of these patients by initiation of specific treatment early. However, further extensive studies are needed to validate these results.},

abstract={The reliability of the Roche AMPLICOR(TM) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) test for identification of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in Difco ESP II broth cultures was evaluated by testing aliquots from all cultures, regardless of specimen type, that were signaled positive by the ESP instrument. Polymerase chain reaction results were compared to those obtained by usual laboratory protocol, whereby MTBC was identified by DNA probe (GenProbe, Inc., San Diego, California, USA), testing sediment from broth samples or colonies on a solid medium. Of the 242 signal-positive ESP II cultures (from 182 patients) evaluated, 98 (40.5%) contained mycobacteria, including 26 MTBC. On initial testing, 27 samples were positive by PCR; 22 of these were MTBC culture positive, and 5 were culture negative for mycobacteria. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of PCR were 84.6, 97.7, 81.5, and 98.1%, respectively. Based on review of the medical records of the patients for whom PCR and culture results were discrepant, one PCR-positive culture negative was a true PCR positive; thus the actual sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of PCR were 85.2, 98.1, 85.2, and 98.1%. Two of the PCR-negative, MTBC culture-positive samples were blood specimens collected in an Isolator tube; and these tubes contain sodium polyanetholsulfonate, which seems to inhibit PCR. If blood specimens are excluded from analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for PCR are 92.0, 97.6, 85.2, and 98.8%, respectively. The mean times from specimen receipt to identification of MTBC were 19 (± 2) days (range, 6 to 39 days) for ESP II plus AMPLICOR(TM) MTB PCR and 25 (± 2) days (range, 8 to 42 days) for DNA probe testing of sediment from broth or colonies on solid media (p < .05). These data indicate that the AMPLICOR(TM) MTB PCR test is a rapid, reliable method for identification of MTBC in positive ESP II cultures, excluding blood specimens collected in Isolator tubes.},

abstract={Introduction: Thens is a strong epidemiological evidence linking the outbreak of HIV infection to the rising incidence of tubercolosis (TB).This increase in rate of tubercolosis was initially reported only in adufts as a result of immunosoppression-induced reactivation of latent infection; more recently a rising number of cases ofTB also m HIV-infected children has been reported.The most important laboratory test for the diagnosis and management of TB is the mycobacterial culture. A promising method for rapid diagnosis is represented by the technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of M.tubercolosis DMA in sputum and in other clinical specimens, but the predictive value of this test remains up to now unclear Case report R.F. is a 7-year-old white boy, perinatally HIV infected with severe immunosoppression (CD4 count &lt; 50mm3).He came to the Hospital wrth fever productive cough and severe asthenia: a chest X-ray film showed a round cavitation in the right upper lobe. Sputum, gastric aspirates, urine and stool cultures resulted negative for M.tubercolosis, as well as for non-tuberculous mycobacteria.Two sputum specimens were positive for M.tuberculosis by PCR On the basis of the results of the PCR test alone, empiric therapy was started with isoniazide, rifampin and pyramzinamide. After a month of antituberculous treatment the patients still presented with intermittent fever and nespiratory distress. As the blood and sputum cultures resulted positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. the antituberculous treatment was suspended and an adequate antibiotic therapy was initiated. Some weeks later the patient was persistenly apiretic and clinically almost asymptomatic, the chest film at that time showed a significant reduction of the pulmonary cavitation. Conclusion: The reported case confirms thatTB disease shouldn't be diagnosed on the basis of the PCR test alone; particularly in HIVinfected and immunocompromised patients it is important to avoid unnecessary and sometimes toxic drugs and to prwide a prompt and adequate treatment of infectious complications.},

abstract={Background. There is a need for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. We have previously used a PCR to detect circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in blood samples from patients (mostly HIV-infected) with pulmonary tuberculosis. We have now prospectively investigated the role of this blood-based PCR assay for diagnosis of this disease in a clinical setting. Methods. Our PCR assay is specific for the IS6110 insertion element of the M tuberculosis complex of organisms. We from ward pulmonary tuberculosis. Personnel who carried out the assay did not know the results of any clinical investigations and ultimate diagnosis, and clinicians did not know the PCR results. Results of the PCR assay were compared with the final clinical diagnosis. A subgroup of 15 patients had blood samples assayed serially to track the PCR signal over time. Findings. 41 patients had a final clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis, and the cases were typical of those seen at our hospital: HIV infection was common, and most cases were not sputum-smear positive for acid-fast bacilli. The PCR assay correctly identified 39 of 41 patients with proven pulmonary tuberculosis, 26 (63%) of whom were sputum-smear negative. There were five patients in whom a positive PCR result did not accord with the final clinical diagnosis, and two of the 44 negative PCR results were classified as false negatives. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay for a diagnosis of tuberculosis was 95% and 89%, respectively. In 15 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and a positive blood assay, the PCR result remained positive after 1 month of therapy, but had reverted to negative in 13 of the 15 by 4 months of therapy.

abstract={The U.S.-Japan Medical Cooperative Program has been started in 1965 and Tuberculosis Panel is one of the most important field of the programs. In this lecture, the recent advances in the basic studies on tuberculosis researches which were reported in Tuberculosis panel of the program were summarized. The host defence mechanisms against M. tuberculosis infection were the most important subject. The role of Th1-mediated cytokins such as IL-2, IFNγ and TNFβ in the host defence mechanism against mycobacterial infection was extensively discussed. Bcg gene of the mice is the example case for the genetic background of host against mycobacterial infection. The virulence factor, however of M. tuberculosis is still unknown. The technique of molecular biology was applied to the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The PCR and RFLP methods are the useful strategies for the rapid diagnosis and analysis of the mode of infection with M. tuberculosis. The development of detection techniques of drug-resistant tubercle bacilli is also urgently required. Another approach by molecular biology to tuberculosis research is the cloning of gene of tuberculin protein and the production recombinant protein of M. tuberculosis. The amino acid sequences of several proteins have been determined and their immunological properties of recombinant proteins were investigated. The immunological functions of lipid fractions of tubercle bacilli such as cord factor (TDM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) have been described. Especially the immunomodulating activities and the role of TDM as diagnostic antigen in the tuberculosis patients were described. The adjuvant activity of mycobacterial cell wall was well established and the minimum structural requirement was reported to be N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D- isoglutamine (MDP). The several MDP derivatives were selected as the cytokine inducers. Especially MDP Lys (L18) was widely used as drug for the increasing the number of white blood cells and platelets in cancer patients. The effectiveness of MDP derivatives on the stimulating of mucosal immunity was also recently reported. The preventing activities of virus infection and cancer metastasis of MDP derivatives were shown in mice models.},

abstract={A method based on DNA amplification and hybridization has been used for the rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in blood samples from 38 hospitalized patients (15 human immunodeficiency virus [HIV)] positive and 23 HIV negative) in whom localized or disseminated forms of tuberculosis were suspected. In 32 of these patients, the diagnosis of tuberculosis was eventually confirmed by conventional bacteriological or histological procedures. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected with the PCR technique in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 9 of 11 (82%) HIV-infected patients and in 7 of 21 (33%) HIV-negative patients (P < 0.01), while M. tuberculosis blood cultures were positive in 1 of 8 (12.5%) and 1 of 18 (5.5%) patients, respectively. PCR was positive in all cases with disseminated disease in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients and also in the HIV-positive patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Seven samples from patients with documented illness other than tuberculosis and 12 specimens from healthy volunteers, including seven volunteers with a recent positive purified protein derivative test, were used as controls and had a negative PCR. These results suggest that detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may be a useful tool for rapid diagnosis of disseminated and extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis, especially in an HIV-positive population.},

abstract={A 57 year-old man was admitted because of headache, nausea, and fever up (38°C). He showed nuchal rigidity slightly. CSF analysis showed 833 white blood cells (WBC) (80% monocyte), protein value of 68 mg/dl, glucose level of 36 mg/dl and ADA level of 11.8 IU/l. Brain pre-contrast CT indicated high density area in right parietal lobe, and it showed slightly homogeneously enhancement with contrast medium. MRI on T2WI demonstrated hypointense lesion with bright central core in right parietal lobe. The lesion showed isointense on T1WI, and indicated homogeneous enhancement with Gd-DTPA. He was sent to our hospital after one week. With only antibiotics the symptoms were relieved and the CSF findings improved during the previous hospital. However, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) DNA was detected in CSF by PCR amplification, and he recovered completely with anti-tuberculous treatment. This case was interesting to reveal atypical features of spontaneous recovery. Since Shankar's study using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of M. tuberculosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the PCR assay have been recognized to be a rapid method for diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM). But there are problems of PCR sensitivity when dealing with CSF samples containing small amount of M. tuberculosis DNA. Comparing direct PCR with nested PCR, we studied on the evaluation of PCR fur diagnosis of TBM. In this study the nested PCR was positive in all CSF specimens from 4 patients with TBM, but we could not detect M. tuberculosis DNA by only the direct PCR. Nested PCR amplification improved the sensitivity and specificity. Therefore the nested PCR assay will be necessary for rapid diagnosis of TBM on the clinical laboratory.},

abstract={Pneumocystis carinii is an opportunistic pathogen causing life threatening pneumonia (PCP) in immunosuppressed patients and particularly among AIDS patients. Whether the infection results from reactivation or reinfection is debated. Since methods for in vitro cultivation still are not successful, the diagnosis is dependant on direct demonstration of the organism in respiratory specimen. In this thesis laboratory diagnostic methods in terms of staining, sampling, antibody detection and DNA amplification are evaluated. Furthermore, the occurrence of the organism in the Western world versus Africa, and in symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV infected patients is studied and discussed. The use of a monoclonal antibody (MAb), 3F6 in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFL) was compared to the two most commonly used chemical stains, silver methenamine and toluidine blue. The IFL method detected both cyst and trophozoite stages of P. carinii and was more sensitive than the chemical stains when applied to sputum samples. Among commercialised MAbs for P. carinii detection by IFL, only the indirect tests were readily applicable to ethanol treated HIV inactivated samples. In contrast to the MAb 3F6, (Dakopatts), the MAb from Northumbria stained only a selection of the cysts and no trophozoites. The relative sensitivity of IFL in detecting the organism in sputum samples compared to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples was estimated to be at least 70%. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can amplify specific DNA fragments, was used for the demonstration of P. carinii in sputum and BAL specimens. The PCR was shown to be specific and more sensitive than IFL. However, P. carinii DNA was found in a few patients without clinical evidence of present, past or future PCP. Thus the possibility of PCR to detect colonization must be considered. Detection of antibodies to P. carinii by indirect IFL was studied in HIV versus non-HIV patients. A titer rise was seen in 45% of non-HIV patients versus only 3% in HIV patients during a PCP episode. No humoral response was seen in AIDS patients, whereas the serology did support the clinical PCP diagnosis in a proportion of the otherwise immunosuppressed patients. Serology may however not be of help in the acute setting. In the beginning of 1988 PCP had not yet been reported from Central Africa where the AIDS epidemic by then was growing fast. The occurrence of P, carinii in Central Africa was evaluated by a comparative study on induced sputum samples from HIV infected patients with pulmonary infection in Stockholm, Sweden and Lusaka, Zambia. No conclusive evidence for the presence of P. carinii pneumonia in Lusaka was found, instead 50% of the patients selected suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis. It was concluded that PCP was of minor importance in Lusaka. In a prospective study on induced sputa from 60 HIV infected patients, asymptomatic infection with P. carinii was found to occur in 5 patients, all of whom progressed to PCP. Thus asymptomatic infection with P. carinii occurs and should be regarded as pathological. There was no evident correlation between conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic P. carinii infection and the immunosuppression as measured by CD4+ cell counts. The overall incidence of PCP appeared to correlate with decreasing CD4 counts but after varying times of reaching critical low values. Hence, in spite of extremely low CD4 counts 6 of 13 patients did not develop PCP during 200 days of observation. These findings do not support the reactivation theory and the possibility of reinfection should be considered.},

abstract={Diagnostic techniques based on PCR have two major problems: false-positive reactions due to contamination with DNA fragments from previous PCRs (amplicons) and false-negative reactions caused by inhibitors that interfere with the PCR. We have improved our previously reported PCR based on the amplification of a fragment of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex- specific insertion element IS6110 with respect to both problems. False- positive reactions caused by amplicon contamination were prevented by the use of uracil-N-glycosylase and dUTP instead of dTTP. We selected a new set of primers outside the region spanned by the formerly used primers to avoid false-positive reactions caused by dTTP-containing amplicons still present in the laboratory. With this new primer set, 16 copies of the IS6110 insertion element, the equivalent of two bacteria, could be amplified 1010 times in 40 cycles, resulting in a mean efficiency of 77% per cycle. To detect the presence of inhibitors of the Taq polymerase, which may cause false-negative reactions, part of each sample was spiked with M. tuberculosis DNA. The DNA purification method using guanidinium thiocyanate and diatoms effectively removed most or all inhibitors of the PCR. However, this was not suitable for blood samples, for which we developed a proteinase K treatment followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. This method permitted detection of 20 M. tuberculosis bacteria per ml of whole blood. Various laboratory procedures were introduced to reduce failure or inhibition of PCR and avoid DNA cross contamination. We have tested 218 different clinical specimens obtained from patients suspected of having tuberculosis. The samples included sputum (n = 145), tissue biopsy samples (n = 25), cerebrospinal fluid (n = 15), blood (n = 14), pleural fluid (n = 9), feces (n = 7), fluid from fistulae (n = 2), and pus from a wound (n = 1). The results obtained by PCR were consistent with those obtained with culture, which is the 'gold standard.' We demonstrate that PCR is a useful technique for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis at various sites.},

All smear positive samples were PCR positive except for 7/138 (5.07%) that were false negative because of the presence of inhibitors. However, the use of several samples for each patient minimize the false negative results. The PCR allowed the detection of more positive results in smear negative sputa from HIV- (50%) than in HIV+ patients (20.5%). In contrast, in smear negative blood samples, PCR was positive more frequently in HIV+ (30%) than in HIV- patients (12.5%). Regarding patients, 15/25 HIV+ and 13/17 HIV-patients had at least one positive sample with PCR whereas only 7/25 and 11/17 respectively for HIV+ and HIV- patients had smear positive samples.

abstract={The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been utilized and demonstrated to be useful for detecting minute amounts of a wide variety of infectious agents. In such studies, one must keep in mind that the most appropriate conditions for amplification vary with organisms of interest. In this study, PCR was used as a rapid and sensitive method for detecting infectious agents for which three assay systems were devised comprising the method for the amplification of human T cell leukemia virus type I, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The possibility of vertical transmission of human T cell leukemia virus type I through cord blood was demonstrated using cord blood mononuclear cells from carrier mothers of this virus. In the study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, PCR was shown to be efficient, particularly in detecting this organism in extrapulmonary cases. Evidence of direct invasion into the central nervous system by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and the concomitant occurrence of mycoplasmaemia in the mycoplasmal central nervous system involvement was obtained using PCR. These results validated the potential of PCR in the clinical research of infectious diseases. 1993 Japan Pediatric Society},

abstract={A gene amplification method of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been devised. A primer pair used in this study is 5′GTTGCCGTGGCGG TATCGG3′ and 5′GCGACATTACGGGGCAGGTGG3′, which brackets a 152-base region encoding the 65KD antigen, and a specific probe is 5′TTTGGGGTCATCTTTGGAGCG3′. The procedure could be completed within 2 days. The specificity and the sensitivity of the PCR for M. tuberculosis complex in identifying M. tuberculosis complex did not conflict with the conventional methods at all. Using this method, we could diagnose three cases of the disease, which had been very difficult to diagnose by the conventional methods, by detecting the DNA from the blood, liver biopsy specimen, lung aspirate, and pleural effusion. © 1992, The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.

abstract={A test based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed for the detection of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in clinical samples. In this test, a 245-bp sequence of the insertion element IS986 was amplified and detected by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide and by Southern blot and dot blot hybridization by using a 188-bp digoxigenin-labeled probe. We tested clinical specimens from 227 patients suspected of having tuberculosis. These included 102 cerebrospinal fluid, 48 sputum, 18 pleural fluid, 5 bronchoalveolar lavage, 18 blood, 7 pus, 8 bone marrow, and 6 urine samples and 15 tissue biopsy specimens. We also tested sputum samples from 75 patients with diseases other than tuberculosis. Sputum samples were first decontaminated, and all samples were treated with proteinase K-detergent solution to extract the DNA. Part of each sample was spiked with M. tuberculosis to provide a semiquantitative assay and to control for the loss of mycobacteria or interference with the PCR which may cause false-negative results. One femtogram of M. tuberculosis DNA could be detected. PCR was positive for all 32 culture-positive (for M. tuberculosis) and Ziehl-Neelsen staining (ZN)-positive samples, 10 of 12 culture-positive and ZN-negative samples, and all 4 culture-negative and ZN-positive samples. PCR detected M. tuberculosis complex bacteria in 35 of 178 culture- and ZN- negative samples. Clinical data supported the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the majority of the 35 patients from whom those samples were obtained.},
