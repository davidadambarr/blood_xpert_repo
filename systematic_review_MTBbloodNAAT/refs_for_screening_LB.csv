METHODS: In 2010, 4025 cases were enrolled in surveillance in South Africa. A total of 969 of 4025 systematically selected nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal specimens (24%) were tested for respiratory viruses and Streptococcus pneumoniae by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of these, 749 (77%) had blood tested for S. pneumoniae. RESULTS: Pneumococcal colonization was detected in 55% of cases (534 of 969). On multivariable analysis that controlled for age and tuberculosis treatment, infection with influenza virus (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.5), adenovirus (adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7), rhinovirus (adjusted OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; adjusted OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4) were associated with pneumococcal colonization. High colonization density was associated with respiratory virus coinfection (adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.6) and invasive pneumococcal pneumonia (adjusted OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.0), after adjustment for age and sex. Seven percent (52 of 749) had pneumococci detected in blood. On multivariable analysis among colonized cases, invasive pneumococcal pneumonia was associated with HIV (adjusted OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.5), influenza virus (adjusted OR, 8.2; 95% CI, 2.7-25.0), high colonization density (adjusted OR, 18.7; 95% CI, 2.3-155.1), and 5 days of hospitalization (adjusted OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.7-8.2). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory virus infection was associated with elevated colonization density and, in turn, invasive pneumococcal pneumonia."

The immunopathological mechanisms underlying TB-IRIS are incompletely defined, and improved understanding is required to derive new treatments and to reduce associated morbidity and mortality. We performed longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of human PBMCs from paradoxical TB-IRIS patients and non-IRIS controls (HIV-TB-coinfected patients commencing antiretroviral therapy who did not develop TB-IRIS). Freshly isolated PBMC stimulated with heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (hkH37Rv) were used for IFN- ELISPOT and RNA extraction. Stored RNA was used for microarray and RT-PCR, whereas corresponding stored culture supernatants were used for ELISA. Stored PBMC were used for perforin and granzyme B ELISPOT and flow cytometry. There were significantly increased IFN- responses to hkH37Rv in TB-IRIS, compared with non-IRIS PBMC (p = 0.035). Microarray analysis of hkH37Rv-stimulated PBMC indicated that perforin 1 was the most significantly upregulated gene, with granzyme B among the top five (log2 fold difference 3.587 and 2.828, respectively), in TB-IRIS. Downstream experiments using RT-PCR, ELISA, and ELISPOT confirmed the increased expression and secretion of perforin and granzyme B. Moreover, granzyme B secretion reduced in PBMC from TB-IRIS patients during corticosteroid treatment. Invariant NKT cell (CD3(+)V24(+)) proportions were higher in TB-IRIS patients (p = 0.004) and were a source of perforin. Our data implicate the granule exocytosis pathway in TB-IRIS pathophysiology. Further understanding of the immunopathogenesis of this condition will facilitate development of specific diagnostic and improved therapeutic options."

Risk factors possibly associated with bovine tuberculosis (BTB) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 802 samples analyzed, one milk (0.25%) and eight blood (2%) samples were positive for M. bovis in the qPCR and their identities were confirmed by sequencing. Animals positive for M. bovis were found in six (30%) of the 20 properties visited. None of the risk factors evaluated were statistically associated with BTB. CONCLUSIONS: M. bovis DNA was detected in one milk sample what may pose a risk to public health because raw milk is commonly consumed in Brazil."

To identify candidate biomarkers, RNA sequencing of whole blood from a well-characterized TB treatment cohort was performed. Application of a validated transcriptional correlate of risk for TB revealed symmetry in host gene expression during progression from latent TB infection to active TB disease and resolution of disease during treatment, including return to control levels after drug therapy. The symmetry was also seen in a TB disease signature, constructed from the TB treatment cohort, that also functioned as a strong correlate of risk. Both signatures identified patients at risk of treatment failure 1-4 weeks after start of therapy. Further mining of the transcriptomes revealed an association between treatment failure and suppressed expression of mitochondrial genes before treatment initiation, leading to development of a novel baseline (pre-treatment) signature of treatment failure. These novel host responses to TB treatment were integrated into a five-gene real-time PCR-based signature that captures the clinically relevant responses to TB treatment and provides a convenient platform for stratifying patients according to their risk of treatment failure. Furthermore, this 5-gene signature is shown to correlate with the pulmonary inflammatory state (as measured by PET-CT) and can complement sputum-based Gene Xpert for patient stratification, providing a rapid and accurate alternative to current methods."

Defining the correlates of vaccine protection is essential to achieve this goal. In this study, we used the wild boar model for mycobacterial infection and TB to characterize the protective mechanisms elicited by a new heat inactivated Mycobacterium bovis vaccine (IV). Oral vaccination with the IV resulted in significantly lower culture and lesion scores, particularly in the thorax, suggesting that the IV might provide a novel vaccine for TB control with special impact on the prevention of pulmonary disease, which is one of the limitations of current vaccines. Oral vaccination with the IV induced an adaptive antibody response and activation of the innate immune response including the complement component C3 and inflammasome. Mycobacterial DNA/RNA was not involved in inflammasome activation but increased C3 production by a still unknown mechanism. The results also suggested a protective mechanism mediated by the activation of IFN- producing CD8+ T cells by MHC I antigen presenting dendritic cells (DCs) in response to vaccination with the IV, without a clear role for Th1 CD4+ T cells. These results support a role for DCs in triggering the immune response to the IV through a mechanism similar to the phagocyte response to PAMPs with a central role for C3 in protection against mycobacterial infection. Higher C3 levels may allow increased opsonophagocytosis and effective bacterial clearance, while interfering with CR3-mediated opsonic and nonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria, a process that could be enhanced by specific antibodies against mycobacterial proteins induced by vaccination with the IV. These results suggest that the IV acts through novel mechanisms to protect against TB in wild boar."

Tuberculous (TB) meningitis leading to infectious cerebral vasculopathy is a rare cause of acute hemiparesis. Case report: A 14-year-old male patient was examined after acute hemiparesis developing within 1day. Neurological examination revealed total hemiplegia on the left side. Brain MRI findings showed bilateral focal T2-weighted signal hyperintensity in the subcortical and deep white matter regions. There were also areas of restricted diffusion in the right basal ganglia. Although the father had a history of pulmonary TB, the patient had not been given TB prophylaxis because of PPD negativity. At lumbar puncture, opening cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was 50cm/H20, CSF protein 66.9mg/dL, and glucose 54mg/dL (concurrent blood glucose 93mg/dL); 170 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per cubic millimeter were present in CSF. Following tests for TB, treatment was started immediately with four anti-TB drugs. TB PCR of CSF and acid-fast bacteria (AFB) staining in gastric aspirate were positive. At clinical follow-up, the patient was able to walk with support at the end of the first month. Conclusion: Various infectious agents have been reported as causes of cerebral vasculopathy. TB, which affects a significant number of patients worldwide, should be kept in mind in terms of cerebral vascular complications. Lumbar puncture is essential in order to diagnose TB meningitis.  2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Here, we aimed to determine circRNA profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from active tuberculosis (TB) patients to identify novel biomarkers for TB. METHODS: Expression profile of circRNAs in PBMCs from 3 active pulmonary TB patients and 3 healthy controls were analyzed by microarray assay. Six circRNAs were selected for validation using real time-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in 40 TB patients and 40 control subjects. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate their values in TB diagnosis. Hsa_circRNA_001937 was chosen for further evaluation in an independent cohort consisting of 115 TB, 40 pneumonia, 40 COPD, 40 lung cancer patients and 90 control subjects. An eight-month follow up was performed in 20 newly diagnosed TB patients to investigate the expression change of hsa_circRNA_001937 after chemotherapy. RESULTS: We revealed and confirmed that a number of circRNAs were dysregulated in TB patients. Of the six studied physio circRNAs, the levels of hsa_circRNA_001937, hsa_circRNA_009024 and hsa_ circRNA_005086 were significantly elevated and hsa_circRNA_102101, hsa_circRNA_104964 and hsa_circRNA_104296 were significantly reduced in PBMCs from TB patients as compared to healthy controls. ROC curve analysis suggested that hsa_circRNA_001937 has the largest area under the curve (AUC = 0.873, P<0.001). Hsa_circRNA_001937 was significantly increased in patients with TB compared with patients with pneumonia, COPD and lung cancer. Hsa_ circRNA_001937 was correlated with TB severity (r = 0.4053, P = 0.010) and its expression significantly decreased after treatment. CONCLUSION: This study identified a set of deregulated circRNAs in active TB PBMCs, our data also suggest that hsa_circRNA_001937 can be used as a potential diagnostic biomarker of TB."

We have previously used a PCR to detect circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in blood samples from patients (mostly HIV-infected) with pulmonary tuberculosis. We have now prospectively investigated the role of this blood-based PCR assay for diagnosis of this disease in a clinical setting. METHODS: Our PCR assay is specific for the IS6110 insertion element of the M tuberculosis complex of organisms. We used it to test peripheral blood from 88 consecutive patients admitted to a chest ward with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Personnel who carried out the assay did not know the results of any clinical investigations and ultimate diagnosis, and clinicians did not know the PCR results. Results of the PCR assay were compared with the final clinical diagnosis. A subgroup of 15 patients had blood samples assayed serially to track the PCR signal over time. FINDINGS: 41 patients had a final clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis, and the cases were typical of those seen at our hospital: HIV infection was common, and most cases were not sputum-smear positive for acid-fast bacilli. The PCR assay correctly identified 39 of 41 patients with proven pulmonary tuberculosis, 26 (63%) of whom were sputum-smear negative. There were five patients in whom a positive PCR result did not accord with the final clinical diagnosis, and two of the 44 negative PCR results were classified as false negatives. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay for a diagnosis of tuberculosis was 95% and 89%, respectively. In 15 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and a positive blood assay,the PCR result remained positive after 1 month of therapy, but had reverted to negative in 13 of the 15 by 4 months of therapy. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that peripheral-blood-based PCR detection for the diagnosis of tuberculosis is a technically feasible approach that has a potentially important role in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis."

While interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-3 and IL-4 mRNA levels are substantially reduced in anergic T cells upon restimulation with SEB, mRNA for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is expressed normally. On the other hand, infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis is known to break an established T-cell anergy. This knowledge prompted us to examine the effect of infection with an intracellular microbe, bacillus Calmett-Gurin (BCG), on the expression of anergy induced with SEB. We have demonstrated that while the SEB-induced anergy was not abrogated by BCG infection, the V beta 8.2 transgenic mice, in which almost all T cells were anergized with SEB, were capable of developing the effective acquired protective immunity, possibly through the preserved capacity to induce IFN-gamma leading to induction of nitric oxide synthase."

We aimed to assess whether global gene expression measured in whole blood of healthy people allowed identification of prospective signatures of risk of active tuberculosis disease. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we followed up healthy, South African adolescents aged 12-18 years from the adolescent cohort study (ACS) who were infected with M tuberculosis for 2 years. We collected blood samples from study participants every 6 months and monitored the adolescents for progression to tuberculosis disease. A prospective signature of risk was derived from whole blood RNA sequencing data by comparing participants who developed active tuberculosis disease (progressors) with those who remained healthy (matched controls). After adaptation to multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), the signature was used to predict tuberculosis disease in untouched adolescent samples and in samples from independent cohorts of South African and Gambian adult progressors and controls. Participants of the independent cohorts were household contacts of adults with active pulmonary tuberculosis disease. FINDINGS: Between July 6, 2005, and April 23, 2007, we enrolled 6363 participants from the ACS study and 4466 from independent South African and Gambian cohorts. 46 progressors and 107 matched controls were identified in the ACS cohort. A 16 gene signature of risk was identified. The signature predicted tuberculosis progression with a sensitivity of 661% (95% CI 632-689) and a specificity of 806% (792-820) in the 12 months preceding tuberculosis diagnosis. The risk signature was validated in an untouched group of adolescents (p=0018 for RNA sequencing and p=00095 for qRT-PCR) and in the independent South African and Gambian cohorts (p values <00001 by qRT-PCR) with a sensitivity of 537% (426-643) and a specificity of 828% (767-86) in the 12 months preceding tuberculosis. INTERPRETATION: The whole blood tuberculosis risk signature prospectively identified people at risk of developing active tuberculosis, opening the possibility for targeted intervention to prevent the disease.

ZiehlNeelsen (ZN) stain has a very low sensitivity in cases of TBM, the sensitivity rates is of about 1020%.The detection rate can be improved by taking large volume CSF samples (>6 ml) and prolonged slide examination (30 min). Culture of MTB from the CSF is slow and insufficiently sensitive. The sensitivity is different, which varies from 36% to 81.8%. The microscopic observation drug susceptibility (MODS) assay was recommended by the World Health Organization in 2011. The sensitivity is 65%, which is more sensitive and faster than CSF smear. Commercial PCR assays were found to be insensitive at detecting MTB in CSF samples. Many research provided the value of ADA on the TBM diagnosis. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are not recommended for diagnosis of active TB disease. Imaging is essential in diagnosis and showing complications of CNS TB. Thwaites criteria and the Lancet consensus scoring system (LCSS) were developed to improve the diagnosis of TBM.

At present, the diagnosis of TB depends on the detection of either mycobacteria or mycobacterial products from clinical specimens. Given the risks posed to both the patient and health care providers by undiagnosed and/or untreated TB, the ability to diagnose TB rapidly in the ICU cannot be understated. In this regard, nucleic acid amplification tests provide relatively quick information about the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) DNA. If available, a blood-based test that would accurately identify persons with TB would be of use in the ICU. Currently available tests such as the T-Spot.TB or QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube can discern infection with Mtb, but are not recommended for the ICU as they cannot rule out TB. In this review, we will discuss the increasing literature that would suggest that a blood-based diagnostic that reflects the host response to TB could be used to diagnose TB in the ICU."

Here we investigate the early response in IP-10 levels (between day 0 and day 7 of TB therapy) to identify bacteriological status at diagnosis among 127 HIV-infected patients starting TB treatment. All participants were then classified as responding or not responding to treatment blindly using a previously described IP-10 kinetic algorithm. There were 77 bacteriologically confirmed cases and 41 Xpert MTB/RIF and culture negative cases. Most participants had a measurable decline in IP-10 during the first 7 days of therapy. Bacteriologically confirmed cases were more likely to have high IP-10 levels at D0 and had a steeper decline than clinically diagnosed cases (mean decline difference 2231pg/dl, 95% CI: 897-3566, p=0.0013).

Smear microscopy, Culture and Line Probe Assay by Polymerase Chain Reaction (LPA PCR) were used for identification of tuberculosis. Results: Based on the chest X-Ray of 200 diabetic patients, suspected with pulmonary infections, 113 were males, 85 were females and 2 were children. All 200 patients were tested for tuberculosis infections, 55 were confirmed based on chest X-ray lesions.

However, it has inherent limitations due to paucibacillary nature of the disease in children and technical difficulties encountered in collection of appropriate sample. Thus, diagnosis is dependent on circumstantial evidence at best supported by conventional tests such as tuberculin test and chest radiograph. Several new tests are being developed but they lack ideal sensitivity and specificity. Hence, it is important to optimise use of current diagnostic tests. Clinical suspicion based on protocol developed by IAP is a pre-requisite of ordering tests and it is only then that proper interpretation is possible. Tuberculin skin test is still a useful screening test. It does help in establishing presence of infection though not necessarily disease. Attention must be paid to ideal test solution, proper technique and cautious interpretation. BCG test is not recommended. Miliary shadows and fibrocaseious cavitary lesions in chest radiograph are highly suggestive of tuberculosis in our epidemiology. CT scan is rarely necessary and is not cost and radiation-effective. It is ideal to attempt bacteriological examination in every suspected case of childhood tuberculosis. Most practical method is collection of gastric aspirate for smear and culture. It is possible to carry out this procedure in out-patient clinic. Better yield is likely with increasing expertise especially in extensive disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage is an invasive test and bacterial yield is comparable to that of gastric aspirate. Tissue collected for histopathological examination must be submitted for bacteriological tests. PCR is not easily available. It has high sensitivity but lower specificity and thus, is not routinely recommended. Serology has no place in diagnosis of tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays are also now available. Sensitivity and specificity of Quantiferon Gold and T-spot tests have not been studied in children and hence are not recommended in routine practice. Instead of trying newer tests, it may be best to avail an expert advice in difficult cases."

Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis validated miR-769-5p, miR-320a and miR-22-3p as miRNAs that were differently present between TB patients and healthy controls. ROC curve analysis revealed that the potential of these 3 miRNAs to distinguish TB patients from healthy controls was high, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) ranged from 0.692 to 0.970. Moreover, miR-320a levels were decreased in drug-resistant TB patients than pan-susceptible TB patients (AUC = 0.882). In conclusion, we identified miR-769-5p, miR-320a and miR-22-3p as potential blood-based biomarkers for TB. In addition, miR-320a may represent a biomarker for drug-resistant TB."

Thus, samples require transportation from peripheral laboratories to these facilities, compromising specimen quality since it is difficult to maintain cold chain. We evaluated OMNIgene SPUTUM Reagent (OMS) for transporting sputum samples for tuberculosis (TB) testing. The study was carried out at Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research using sputa from Korle Bu Teaching Hospital and La General Hospital in Ghana. METHODS: In a laboratory-based controlled experiment (CE), sputum contaminants were determined on blood agar before treatment with OMS and N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH). TB testing included smear microscopy, culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF. Afterward, two peripheral laboratories were trained to transport sputum samples with OMS without cold chain. Positivity, negativity, and contamination rates were compared between both methods using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Cohen's Kappa was also used to determine agreements. RESULTS: Among 104 sputum samples analyzed in the CE, 93 (89.4%) had bacterial growth on blood agar before decontamination, while 6 (5.8%) and 5 (4.8%) contaminated after NALC-NaOH and OMS treatment, respectively. Contamination was high with NALC-NaOH (12.8%) than OMS (4.3%) on Lowenstein-Jensen media (P < 0.001), but mycobacterial positivity was comparable: NALC-NaOH of 74.5% and OMS of 78.7%. Smear positivity after NALC-NaOH treatment was 89.4% and OMS was 75.9% (P = 0.491). All except one of the samples tested positive by Xpert MTB/RIF after both treatment. Sixteen samples were evaluated in the field experiment and 81.3% yielded positive culture, and no contamination on LJ was observed. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that OMS works well as a transport and decontaminating reagent of samples for TB testing."

The study investigates the E. faecalis specific innate immune cells interplay between Natural Killer cells (NK) and Dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro. The present study also determines the prevalence, phenotype, and genotype of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from paediatric patients with urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 14 clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp were characterized using standard phenotypic tests and virulence factors were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Immature monocyte-derived DCs were cultured in the presence of six pathogenic E. faecalis isolates infected DCs were co-cultured with NK cells. Bacteria induced matured DCs and activated NK cells were evaluated by polychromatic flow cytometry. RESULTS: Out of 14 isolates, 13 were identified as E. faecalis. E. faecalis infected DCs differentiated into inflammatory and CD141+DCs that promote NK cell activation. Activated NK cells significantly elevated the secretion of cytokines and chemokines in infected DCs during E. faecalis. This suggests that DC induced NK cell activation is effectively enhanced by the presence of E. faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Studies on virulence determinants are necessary to understand the pathogenesis of E. faecalis. DC/NK cross-talk is of particular importance at mucosal surfaces such as the intestine, urinary tract where the immune system exists in intimate association with commensal bacteria. We found E. faecalis specific NK cells activation by infected DC-derived effector signals may involve in the killing of transformed or infected cells, thus coordinating innate and adaptive immune responses. E. faecalis specific DC/NK interaction is necessary for DC maturation and modulation of innate effector functions. Similarly, activated NK cells that induce- maturation of DC by pattern recognition receptors are also required for the generation of bacterial specific adaptive immunity."

To review the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis of the sternoclavicular joint in 13 patients. Methods. Records of 9 men and 4 women aged 26 to 47 (mean, 36.5) years who presented with tuberculosis of the right (n=8) or left (n=5) sternoclavicular joint were reviewed. Results. All 13 patients had a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate at presentation. Nine patients presented with systemic symptoms including malaise, fever, or loss of weight/appetite. Local symptoms included cold abscess (n=5), tenderness and non-fluctuant swelling (n=4), and discharging sinus (n=4). The mean duration of symptoms was 2.7 (range, 17) months. Four patients had multifocal involvement of the proximal ulna (n=1), lung (n=2), and meninges (n=1). Aspiration (n=3), fine needle aspiration cytology (n=4), drainage (n=2), or curettage (n=4) of the swelling, abscess, or sinus was performed, and the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology (n=8), polymerase chain reaction (n=5), or culture (n=1). Two patients were diagnosed based on clinical suspicion. 11 patients responded to antituberculous therapy (ATT), and symptoms resolved after 6 to 8 weeks. Two patients did not respond to ATT after 3 months and were screened for immunocompromising disorders or drug resistance. Their CD4 count and CD4:CD8 ratio was low, and an immunomodulation regimen was prescribed as an adjunct to ATT. Conclusion. A high level of clinical suspicion is needed to diagnose tuberculosis of the sternoclavicular joint in patients with pain/tenderness, discharging sinus, or cold abscess. A combination of histopathological and microbiological tests, and PCR can confirm the diagnosis.  2015, Hong Kong University Press. All rights reserved."

Although culture is the reference for diagnosis, its sensitivity is compromised, especially in paucibacillary samples. Because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifies mycobacterial DNA, it is more sensitive than culture for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However, its performance can be affected by intrinsic sample inhibitors and by the extraction/detection techniques used. METHODS: We evaluated the influence of preanalytical conditions on Mtb detection in samples of sputum (SPU), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and pleural fluid (PF) using combinations of extraction/detection methods. Respiratory samples were prepared to contain different concentrations of red blood cells and nucleated cells to which increasing amounts of Mtb colonies were inoculated and submitted to PCR. RESULTS: Up to 102 CFU/ml of Mtb were detected in the SPU in all methods, except for the Roche extraction/detection method, regardless of the preanalytical sample condition. In BAL samples, medium and high concentrations of cells and high concentrations of red blood cells contributed to a lower Mtb detection, regardless of the extraction method used. In PF, red blood cells were the variable that most interfered with Mtb detection, with better recovery (102 CFU/ml) observed with the Qiagen/Nanogen combination. CONCLUSION: The choice of Mtb extraction and detection method is of fundamental importance for PCR analytical sensitivity, especially when paucibacillary samples and/or samples containing potential PCR inhibitors are analyzed."

Although highly specific, IGRAs have a relatively high false-negative rate in active TB patients. A more sensitive assay is needed. IFN--induced protein 10 (IP-10) is an alternative biomarker with a 100-fold-higher expression level than IFN-, allowing for different analysis platforms, including molecular detection. The PCR technique is already an integrated tool in most TB laboratories and, thus, an obvious platform to turn to. In this case-control study, we investigated the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a molecular assay detecting IP-10 mRNA expression following antigen stimulation of a blood sample. We included 89 TB patients and 99 healthy controls. Blood was drawn in QuantiFeron-TB gold in-tube (QFT) assay tubes. Eight hours poststimulation, IP-10 mRNA expression was analyzed, and 20h poststimulation, IP-10 and IFN- protein plasma levels were analyzed using an in-house IP-10 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the official QFT ELISA, respectively. The IP-10 mRNA assay provided high specificity (98%), sensitivity (80%), and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) (0.97); however, the QFT assay provided a higher overall diagnostic potential, with specificity of 100%, sensitivity of 90%, and AUC of 0.99. The IP-10 protein assay performed on par with the QFT assay, with specificity of 98%, sensitivity of 87%, and AUC of 0.98. We have provided proof of high technical performance of a molecular assay detecting IP-10 mRNA expression. As a diagnostic tool, this assay would gain from further optimization, especially on the kinetics of IP-10 mRNA expression."

However, few studies have been reported in active pulmonary tuberculosis (APTB). The global circRNA expression was detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of APTB patients (n=5) and health controls (HC) (n=5) by using high-throughput sequencing. According to the systematical bioinformatics analysis, the basic content of circRNAs and their fold changes in the two groups were calculated. We selected 6 significant differentially expressed circRNAs, hsa_circ_0005836, hsa_circ_0009128, hsa_circ_0003519, hsa_circ_0023956, hsa_circ_0078768, and hsa_circ_0088452 and validated the expression in PBMCs from APTB (n=10) and HC (n=10) by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCRs). Further, the verification of these specific circRNAs (hsa_circ_0005836 and hsa_circ_0009128) between APTB (n=34) and HC (n=30) in PBMCs was also conducted by qRT-PCRs. The RNA-seq data showed the significant differential expression of the 523 circRNAs between the APTB and HC groups (199 circRNAs were significantly up-regulated and 324 circRNAs were down-regulated). Hsa_circ_0005836 and hsa_circ_0009128 expression was significantly down-regulated in the PBMCs of APTB (P<0.05) in the samples of APTB compared to HC in our study. The gene ontology based enrichment analysis of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNAs network showed that cellular catabolic process (P=7.10E-08), regulation of metabolic process (P=2.10E-06), catalytic activity (P=3.67E-08), protein binding (P=1.71E-07), cell part (P=3.46E-06), intracellular part (P=1.71E-07), and intracellular (P=3.67E-08) were recognized in the comparisons between APTB and HC. Based on KEGG analysis, HTLV-I infection, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, neurotrophin signaling pathway and mTOR signaling pathway were relevant during tuberculosis bacillus infection. We found for the first time that hsa_circ_0005836 and hsa_circ_0009128 were significantly down-regulated in the PBMCs of APTB compared with HC. Our findings indicate hsa_circ_0005836 might serve as a novel potential biomarker for TB infection."

METHODS: A total of 62 children who were diagnosed with tuberculosis from June 2017 to December 2018 were enrolled as the case group, and 64 healthy children were enrolled as the healthy control group. Peripheral venous blood samples with a volume of 2 mL were collected, and quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of the molecules associated with the Notch signaling pathway (receptors Notch1-4, ligands Jagged1/2 and DLL1/3/4, and downstream target genes Hes1 and Hey1) in leukocytes. RESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, the case group had significant increases in the mRNA expression levels of Notch1, Notch2, and DLL4 in leukocytes (P<0.05), while there were no significant differences in the mRNA expression levels of Notch3/4, Jagged1/2, DLL1/3, Hes1, and Hey1 between the two groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There are significant increases in the mRNA expression of Notch1/2 and DLL4 in children with tuberculosis, while there are no significant changes in the expression of downstream target genes, suggesting that the Notch signaling pathway, which is activated by the interaction between Notch1/2 and DLL4 after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, may play a role in childhood tuberculosis by acting on other target genes, and further studies are needed for clarification."

Our goal was to evaluate the clinical performance of a newly developed assay that can rapidly diagnose active TB cases by direct detection of Mtb-derived antigens in patients' blood samples. METHODS: Nanoparticle (NanoDisk)-enriched peptides derived from the Mtb virulence factors CFP-10 (10-kDa culture factor protein) and ESAT-6 (6-kDa early secretory antigenic target) were analyzed by high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS). Serum from 294 prospectively enrolled Chinese adults were analyzed with this NanoDisk-MS method to evaluate the performance of direct serum Mtb antigen measurement as a means for rapid diagnosis of active TB cases. RESULTS: NanoDisk-MS diagnosed 174 (88.3%) of the study's TB cases, with 95.8% clinical specificity, and with 91.6% and 85.3% clinical sensitivity for culture-positive and culture-negative TB cases, respectively. NanoDisk-MS also exhibited 88% clinical sensitivity for pulmonary and 90% for extrapulmonary TB, exceeding the diagnostic performance of mycobacterial culture for these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Direct detection and quantification of serum Mtb antigens by NanoDisk-MS can rapidly and accurately diagnose active TB in adults, independent of disease site or culture status, and outperform Mycobacterium-based TB diagnostics."

There is limited information on the association between colonization density of upper respiratory tract colonizers and pathogen-specific pneumonia. We assessed this association for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pneumocystis jirovecii. METHODS. In 7 low- and middle-income countries, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from children with severe pneumonia and age-frequency matched community controls were tested using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Differences in median colonization density were evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Density cutoffs were determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. Cases with a pathogen identified from lung aspirate culture or PCR, pleural fluid culture or PCR, blood culture, and immunofluorescence for P. jirovecii defined microbiologically confirmed cases for the given pathogens. RESULTS. Higher densities of H. influenzae were observed in both microbiologically confirmed cases and chest radiograph (CXR)-positive cases compared to controls. Staphylococcus aureus and P. jirovecii had higher densities in CXR-positive cases vs controls. A 5.9 log10 copies/mL density cutoff for H. influenzae yielded 86% sensitivity and 77% specificity for detecting microbiologically confirmed cases; however, densities overlapped between cases and controls and positive predictive values were poor (<3%). Informative density cutoffs were not found for S. aureus and M. catarrhalis, and a lack of confirmed case data limited the cutoff identification for P. jirovecii. CONCLUSIONS. There is evidence for an association between H. influenzae colonization density and H. influenzae-confirmed pneumonia in children; the association may be particularly informative in epidemiologic studies. Colonization densities of M. catarrhalis, S. aureus, and P. jirovecii are unlikely to be of diagnostic value in clinical settings."

METHODS: Expression of immune biomarkers was analyzed in peripheral blood cells stimulated and non-stimulated with M. tuberculosis antigens ESAT-6, CFP10 and TB7.7. in Warao indigenous individuals. These biomarkers may be able to differentiate TB states, such as active tuberculosis (ATB) cases and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) from non-infected controls (NIC). A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay was performed on 100 blood samples under non-stimulation or direct ex vivo conditions (NS=50) and stimulation conditions (S=50). RESULTS: The findings are shown as the median and interquartile range (IQR) of relative gene expression levels of IFN-, CD14, MMP9, CCR5, CCL11, CXCL9/MIG, and uPAR/PLAUR immune biomarkers. MMP9 levels were significantly higher in the LTBI-NS and LTBI-S groups compared with the NIC-NS and NIC-S groups. However, CCR5 levels were significantly lower in the LTBI-S group compared with both NIC-NS and NIC-S groups. CCL11 levels were significantly lower in the LTBI-S group compared with the NIC-NS group. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings showed that MMP9 immune biomarkers separated LTBI indigenous individuals from NIC indigenous individuals, while CCR5, CCL11, CD14, and IFN- did not differentiate TB states from NIC. MMP9 may be useful as a potential biomarker for LTBI and new infected case detection among Warao indigenous individuals at high risk of developing the disease. It may also be used to halt the epidemic, which will require further validation in larger studies."

Till date, to the best of our knowledge, no study has so far been conducted to show the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions mapping in PTB patients. Therefore we performed the present study with the aim to investigate oxidative stress parameters along with mtDNA damage in newly diagnosed untreated PTB patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective study carried out in Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sevagram,Wardha, Maharashtra during september 2017 to september 2018.Thirty newly diagnosed untreated PTB patients and thirty age matched healthy controls were enrolled in the present study. Analysis of Oxidative stress parameters such as nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were done by calorimetric methods. Assessment of mitochondrial DNA damage was carried out by mtDNA deletions mapping using primer shift long range polymerase chain reaction technique. RESULTS: There was significant increase in levels of oxidative stress parameters, nitric oxide and malondialdehyde, in PTB patients compared to controls (p<0.01). Generally there are two common deletion sites of ""13 bp direct repeats"" (ACCTCCCTCACCA) in mtDNA. One at the junction sites from bp 8470 to 8482 bp and another from bp 13447 to 13460 bp which make mtDNA more prone for 4977bp deletion. Out of thirty cases of PTB, two cases showed mtDNA damage in the form of mtDNA deletion of 4977bp. There was no mtDNA deletion in any control which can be attributed to continuous generation of oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: This pilot study has been able to demonstrate that compared to controls, in newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients some mtDNA damage did occur and was probably due to continuous generation of oxidative stress in tuberculous patients. However, sample size is too small to draw any conclusions but definitely a more comprehensive study, by recruiting more number of pulmonary tuberculosis patients is warranted to establish correlation between oxidative stress and mtDNA damage in PTB."

This article examines bottlenecks and opportunities for scaling up integrated pediatric HIV services in Nepal. Methods This is a descriptive study using both mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, conducted in January 2015 in 19 facilities in five regions of Nepal most affected by HIV epidemic. The qualitative methods comprised in-depth structured interviews with key informants (leadership of The National Center for AIDS and STD Control and National Public Health Laboratory, district management teams, medical officers in charge of health facilities and HIV clinics, frontline staff at antenatal care and HIV clinics and laboratory). The quantitative methods were used to abstract data of HIV-infected pregnant women seen between January and December 2014, HIV-exposed infants aged less than 12 months, and HIV infected children aged less than 15 years who were initiated HIV treatment from 2010 to 2014. Structured tools were used to collect data which were analysed using IBM SPSS. Results Of the 19 facilities assessed, 18(98%), 18(98%), 14(75%), and 11(58%) provided prevention of mother-Tochild transmission (PMTCT), Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), pediatric ART and nutrition rehabilitation services, respectively. However, only 1(5%) facility collected onsite dried blood spots (DBS) for PCR HIV testing and 6(32%) facilities provided counselling and referral for DBS. In 2014, of the 121 HIV-exposed infants recorded, only 21(17%) received PCR test. The median turnaround time of the PCR test results was 54 days. Of the 21 records with PCR test, 11(52.5%) were from PMTCT clinics, 7(33%) from Nutritional rehabilitation clinics, and 3(14.5%) from pediatric outpatient clinic. Conversely, 934 children were initiated ART between 2010 and 2014, of which 5% were infants and 29% aged between 1 and 5 years. 298(32%) had comorbidities of which 64% had malnutrition. A total of 534(57%) had tuberculosis (TB) status assessed of which 58(11%) had active TB. Infants had lowest retention (63%), high mortality (17.4%), and loss to follow-up (10.9%). Conclusion Few facilities collect DBS and few children receive PCR tests with limited linkage to ART. This has led to late ART initiation, comorbidities, including TB coinfections and poor outcomes. The results indicate that there are opportunities for improving HIV case finding among HIV-exposed infants in PMTCT, EPI, TB, and nutrition services if provider initiated testing and counselling at the point of service delivery is institutionalized in these settings."

However, TB can be difficult to diagnose as it may be extra pulmonary and paucibacillary. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate undiagnosed TB in patients with HIV infection and severe anaemia and to identify the optimal investigations for diagnosing TB. Setting: Mthatha General Hospital, a district hospital. Methods: The study was a case series. Results: Haemoglobin levels ranged from 3.6 g/dL to 7.9 g/dL, the mean CD4 count was 176 cells/L and 80% of patients had a positive TB symptom screen. Forty-three (86%) patients had either clinical or bacteriologically proven TB of whom 33 had pulmonary TB, 34 had extra pulmonary TB and 24 had both types. The diagnostic yield for TB was: chest X-ray (CXR) 91%; ultrasound (US) abdomen pericardium and lower chest 62%; sputum Xpert MTB/RIF 35%; TB blood culture 21% and TB urine culture 15%. Blood and urine cultures did not identify any additional cases over those identified by CXR and US. The laboratory turnaround times were as follows: sputum Xpert, 1.6 days; blood culture, 20 days and urine culture, 28 days. CXR and US were done within one day of initial patient assessment. Conclusions: The majority of HIV patients with severe anaemia had TB disease, and extra pulmonary TB was as prevalent as pulmonary TB. CXR, US and sputum Xpert were the optimum tests for rapid diagnosis of TB. South African national TB/HIV guidelines should incorporate these specific tests to diagnose TB in patients with HIV and severe anaemia.  2017. The Authors."

Research show that microRNAs have potential to be used as biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment response and can be used for therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, microRNA expression has effects on immune cell functions, which may lead to disease. Considering the important protective role of neutrophils and B-cells during M.tb infection, we evaluated the expression of microRNAs, known to alter function of these cells, in the context of human TB. We utilised real-time PCR to evaluate the levels of microRNA transcripts in the peripheral blood of TB cases and healthy controls. We found that neutrophil-associated miR-197-3p, miR-99b-5p and miR-191-5p transcript levels were significantly lower in TB cases. Additionally, B-cell-associated miR-320a, miR-204-5p, miR331-3p and other transcript levels were higher in TB cases. The miRNAs differentially expressed in neutrophils are predominantly implicated in signalling pathways leading to cytokine productions. Here, the decreased expression in TB cases may imply a lack of suppression on signalling pathways, which may lead to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma. Furthermore, the miRNAs differentially expressed in B-cells are mostly involved in the induction/suppression of apoptosis. Further functional studies are however required to elucidate the significance and functional effects of changes in the expression of these microRNAs."

Aims: To review the performance of TB diagnostics and their suitability to its characteristics in young children. Methods: Expert opinion and review of the literature. Main findings: The lack of a sufficient number of research studies on TB diagnostics for children hinders the preparation of systematic literature reviews. Information on test performance in children is often extrapolated from studies in adults and there is a dearth of evidence of test performance in children. Approaches to shorten the time required for diagnosis (by using a variety of specimens) are needed and there is preliminary evidence that such schemes are feasible. Diagnostics based on smear microscopy such as LED-FM, serological tests and IGRAS are unlikely to improve the diagnosis of active TB in children. Liquid and the MODS culture methods are more sensitive than solid culture, and new methods to detect mycobacterium nucleic acid or its components such as TrDNA fragments, LAMP assays and Xpert MTB/RIF have good potential to increase the number of cases confirmed. These tests should be evaluated in specimens which are easily accessible in children such as fine-needle aspiration biopsy, urine, blood and stools. Interpretation: The evaluation of new diagnostic tests for TB in children is overdue. The lack of suitable diagnostic tests hinders the proper management of children, the assessment of the real burden of childhood TB, evaluation of the efficacy of new treatments and vaccines and, ultimately, the development of effective control interventions.

Diabetes increases the overall risk of developing Tuberculosis (TB) and contributes to adverse treatment outcomes. Active screening for both diseases can reduce TB transmission and prevent the development of complications of DM. We investigated bi-directional TB-DM screening in Karachi, Pakistan, a country that ranks fifth among high TB burden countries, and has the seventh highest country burden for DM. METHODS: Between February to November 2014, community-based screeners identified presumptive TB and DM through verbal screening at private health clinics. Individuals with presumptive TB were referred for a chest X-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF. Presumptive DM cases had random blood glucose (RBS) tested. All individuals with bacteriologically positive TB were referred for diabetes testing (RBS). All pre-diabetics and diabetics were referred for a chest X-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF test. The primary outcomes of this study were uptake of TB and DM testing. RESULTS: A total of 450,385 individuals were screened, of whom 18,109 had presumptive DM and 90,137 had presumptive TB. 14,550 of these individuals were presumptive for both DM and TB. The uptake of DM testing among those with presumptive diabetes was 26.1% while the uptake of TB testing among presumptive TB cases was 5.9%. Despite efforts to promote bi-directional screening of TB and DM, the uptake of TB testing among pre-diabetes and diabetes cases was only 4.7%, while the uptake of DM testing among MTB positive cases was 21.8%. CONCLUSION: While a high yield for TB was identified among pre-diabetics and diabetics along with a high yield of DM among individuals diagnosed with TB, there was a low uptake of TB testing amongst presumptive TB patients who were recorded as pre-diabetic or diabetic. Bi-directional screening for TB and DM which includes the integration of TB diagnostics, DM screening and TB-DM treatment within existing health care programs will need to address the operational challenges identified before implementing this as a strategy in public health programs."

The clinical diagnostic procedure for TB is time-consuming and laborious. In the last 20 years, real-time fluorescence-based quantitative PCR (real-time PCR) has become a better alternative for TB diagnosis in clinics due to its sensitivity and specificity. Recently, digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) has been developed, and it might be an ideal alternative to conventional real-time PCR for microorganism detection. In this study, we aimed to assess the capacity of ddPCR and real-time PCR for detecting low levels of circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA. The study involved testing whole blood samples for an MTB DNA target (known as IS6110). Blood samples were obtained from 28 patients with pulmonary TB, 28 patients with extrapulmonary TB, and 28 healthy individuals. The results show that ddPCR could be used to measure low levels of MTB DNA, and it has the potential to be used to diagnose pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB based on clinical samples."

Functional studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) indicate that B-cell deficiencies, and a lack of IL10 and IL35 leads to a poor prognosis. We hypothesised that B-cells play a role during tuberculosis. We evaluated B-cell mRNA expression using real-time PCR from healthy community controls, individuals with other lung diseases and newly diagnosed untreated pulmonary TB patients at three different time points (diagnosis, month 2 and 6 of treatment).We show that FASLG, IL5RA, CD38 and IL4 expression was lower in B-cells from TB cases compared to healthy controls. The changes in expression levels of CD38 may be due to a reduced activation of B-cells from TB cases at diagnosis. By month 2 of treatment, there was a significant increase in the expression of APRIL and IL5RA in TB cases. Furthermore, after 6 months of treatment, APRIL, FASLG, IL5RA and CD19 were upregulated in B-cells from TB cases. The increase in the expression of APRIL and CD19 suggests that there may be restored activation of B-cells following anti-TB treatment. The upregulation of FASLG and IL5RA indicates that B-cells expressing regulatory genes may play an important role in the protective immunity against M.tb infection. Our results show that increased activation of B-cells is present following successful TB treatment, and that the expression of FASLG and IL5RA could potentially be utilised as a signature to monitor treatment response."

The risk of tuberculosis activation is also high. The appropriate LTBI screening and treatment is required in this population. Meanwhile, whether hemodialysis adequacy is associated with LTBI in the ESRD population is unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between hemodialysis adequacy and LTBI in ESRD patients. Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, we reviewed all outpatient-based ESRD patients in our artificial kidney room. Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) was used for the diagnosis of LTBI. Clinical variables including nutritional adequacy (i.e., normalized protein catabolic rate, nPCR) and dialysis adequacy (i.e., Kt/V) were compared between IGRA-positive and IGRA-negative patients. Results: A total of 90 patients were enrolled, of which 20 (22.2%) had positive IGRA results using the QuantiFERON-TB method. Old fibrotic changes and nPCR (g/kg/day) were significantly different between IGRA-positive and IGRA-negative patients (both p < 0.005), while serum albumin and Kt/V were comparable (p = 0.429 and p = 0.590, respectively). Normalized PCR remained to be significant in a multivariate logistic regression analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.911 (0.861-0.963); p = 0.001). The cutoff nPCR value less than 0.87 g/kg/day had an adjusted hazard ratio of 7.74 (1.77-33.74) for predicting LTBI. Patients with nPCR value less than 0.87 g/kg/day were older and had lower serum hemoglobin, albumin, calcium concentration, and Kt/V levels than those with nPCR value greater than 0.87 g/kg/day. Conclusions: Nutritional adequacy, especially when assessing nPCR value, was associated with LTBI, while dialysis adequacy was not associated with LTBI.  2019 by the authors.

Molecular diagnostic tools are necessary, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. There is no approved commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that can be used to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis in non-respiratory samples, such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We aimed to validate the threshold cycle (Ct) cut-off points; calculate the operational characteristics of real-time PCR for detection of M. tuberculosis (MTb qPCR) in the CSF; and the inhibitory affect of CSF red blood cells (RBC) and total proteins on MTb qPCR. Methods A total of 334 consecutive participants were enrolled. Based on clinical, laboratory and imaging data, cases of suspected TBM were categorized as definite, probable, possible or not TBM cases. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to select the best discriminating Ct value. Results For TBM cases categorized as definite or probable (n=21), the Ct validated for CSF (39.5) improved the diagnostic performance of MTb qPCR on CSF samples. The sensitivity was 29%, specificity was 95%, positive predictive value was 26%, negative predictive value was 95%, efficiency was 90% and positive likelihood was 5.3. The CSF RBC and total protein did not affect the positivity of the MTb qPCR.

Never before in the history of mankind have more patients been affected by MDRTB than is the case today. The World Health Organization reports that MDR-TB outcomes are poor despite staggeringly high management costs. Moreover, treatment is prolonged, adverse events are common, and the majority of affected patients do not receive adequate treatment. As MDR-TB strains are often resistant to one or more second-line anti-TB drugs, in-depth genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing is needed to construct personalised treatment regimens to improve treatment outcomes. For the first time in decades, the availability of novel drugs such as bedaquiline allow us to design potent and well-tolerated personalised MDR-TB treatment regimens based solely on oral drugs. In this article, we present management guidance to optimise the diagnosis, algorithm-based treatment, drug dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring, and the management of adverse events and comorbidities, associated with MDRTB. We also discuss the role of surgery, physiotherapy, rehabilitation, palliative care and smoking cessation in patients with MDR-TB. We hope that incorporating these recommendations into patient care will be helpful in optimising treatment outcomes, and lead to more MDRTB patients achieving a relapse-free cure.  2019 The Union."

Mycobacterium africanum West Africa 2 (Maf 2) remains an important cause of TB in West Africa and causes one third of disease in The Gambia. Since the introduction of MPT64 antigen tests, a higher than expected rate of suspected non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) was seen among AFB smear positive TB suspects, which led us to prospectively assess sensitivity of the MPT64 antigen test in our setting. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the abundance of mRNA encoded by the mpt64 gene in sputa of patients with untreated pulmonary TB caused by Maf 2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Subsequently, prospectively collected sputum samples from presumptive TB patients were inoculated in the BACTEC MGIT 960 System. One hundred and seventy-three acid fast bacilli (AFB)-positive and blood agar negative MGIT cultures were included in the study. Cultures were tested on the day of MGIT positivity with the BD MGIT TBc Identification Test. A random set of positives and all negatives were additionally tested with the SD Bioline Ag MPT64 Rapid. MPT64 negative cultures were further incubated at 37C and retested until positive. Bacteria were spoligotyped and assigned to different lineages. Maf 2 isolates were 2.52-fold less likely to produce a positive test result and sensitivity ranged from 78.4% to 84.3% at the beginning and end of the recommended 10 day testing window, respectively. There was no significant difference between the tests. We further showed that the decreased rapid test sensitivity was attributable to variations in mycobacterial growth behavior and the smear grades of the patient. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In areas where Maf 2 is endemic MPT64 tests should be cautiously used and MPT64 negative results confirmed by a second technique, such as nucleic acid amplification tests, to avoid their misclassification as NTMs."

However, the grim fact is that the new, rapid, and safe methods for clinical diagnosis are lacking. Moreover, although auto-lysosome is critical in clearing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathological signicance of microRNAs, as biomarkers of tuberculosis, in autophagosome maturation is unclear. Here, these microRNAs were investigated by Solexa sequencing and qPCR validation, and a potential diagnostic model was established by logistic regression. Besides that, the mechanism of one of the microRNAs involved in the occurrence of tuberculosis was studied. The results showed that the expression of miR-423-5p, miR-17-5p, and miR-20b-5p were signicantly increased in the serum of patients with tuberculosis. The combination of these three microRNAs established a model to diagnose tuberculosis with an accuracy of 78.18%, and an area under the curve value of 0.908. Bioinformatics analysis unveiled miR-423-5p as the most likely candidate in regulating autophagosome maturation. The up-regulation of miR-423-5p could inhibit autophagosome maturation through suppressing autophagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages. Further investigations showed that VPS33A was the direct target of miR-423-5p, and the two CUGCCCCUC domains in VPS33A 3'-UTR were the direct regulatory sites for miR-423-5p. In addition, an inverse correlation between VPS33A and miR-423-5p was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with tuberculosis. Since the inhibition of autolysosome formation plays a critical role in tuberculosis occurrence, our ndings suggests that miR-423-5p could suppress autophagosome-lysosome fusion by post-transcriptional regulation of VPS33A, which might be important for the occurrence of active tuberculosis."

Understanding causes of mortality could inform the development of novel management strategies to improve survival. We aimed to assess clinical and microbiologic determinants of mortality and to characterize the pathophysiological processes underlying death by evaluating host soluble inflammatory mediators and determined the relationship between these mediators and death as well as biomarkers of disseminated tuberculosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult patients with HIV hospitalized with a new diagnosis of HIV-associated tuberculosis were enrolled in Cape Town between 2014 and 2016. Detailed tuberculosis diagnostic testing was performed. Biomarkers of tuberculosis dissemination and host soluble inflammatory mediators at baseline were assessed. Of 682 enrolled participants, 576 with tuberculosis (487/576, 84.5% microbiologically confirmed) were included in analyses. The median age was 37 years (IQR = 31-43), 51.2% were female, and the patients had advanced HIV with a median cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count of 58 cells/L (IQR = 21-120) and a median HIV viral load of 5.1 log10 copies/mL (IQR = 3.3-5.7). Antituberculosis therapy was initiated in 566/576 (98.3%) and 487/576 (84.5%) started therapy within 48 hours of enrolment. Twelve-week mortality was 124/576 (21.5%), with 46/124 (37.1%) deaths occurring within 7 days of enrolment. Clinical and microbiologic determinants of mortality included disseminated tuberculosis (positive urine lipoarabinomannan [LAM], urine Xpert MTB/RIF, or tuberculosis blood culture in 79.6% of deaths versus 60.7% of survivors, p = 0.001), sepsis syndrome (high lactate in 50.8% of deaths versus 28.9% of survivors, p < 0.001), and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (16.9% of deaths versus 7.2% of survivors, p = 0.002). Using non-supervised two-way hierarchical cluster and principal components analyses, we describe an immune profile dominated by mediators of the innate immune system and chemotactic signaling (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1Ra], IL-6, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta [MIP-1]/C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 [CCL4], interferon gamma-induced protein-10 [IP-10]/C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 [CXCL10], MIP-1 alpha [MIP-1]/CCL3), which segregated participants who died from those who survived. This immune profile was associated with mortality in a Cox proportional hazards model (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.2, 95%CI = 1.9-2.7, p < 0.001) and with detection of biomarkers of disseminated tuberculosis. Clinicians attributing causes of death identified tuberculosis as a cause or one of the major causes of death in 89.5% of cases. We did not perform longitudinal sampling and did not have autopsy-confirmed causes of death. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we did not identify a major contribution from coinfections to these deaths. Disseminated tuberculosis, sepsis syndrome, and rifampicin resistance were associated with mortality. An immune profile dominated by mediators of the innate immune system and chemotactic signaling was associated with both tuberculosis dissemination and mortality. These findings provide pathophysiologic insights into underlying causes of mortality and could be used to inform the development of novel treatment strategies and to develop methods to risk stratify patients to appropriately target novel interventions. Causal relationships cannot be established from this study."

IP-10 levels in plasma, DPS and DBS samples collected before, during (2 months) and after TB treatment of 36 EPTB patients (6 culture and/or Xpert MTB/RIF positive and 30 clinically diagnosed) and 8 pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients, were quantified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There was a high positive correlation between IP-10 measured in plasma and DPS and DBS, respectively. We found a significant decline in IP-10 levels from baseline to end of treatment in plasma, DPS and DBS, both in EPTB and PTB patients. The declines were observed already after 2 months in HIV negative patients. In conclusion, the DPS/DBS IP-10 assay allows for easy and manageable monitoring in low-resource settings and our findings suggest that IP-10 may serve as a biomarker for treatment efficacy in EPTB patients, albeit further studies in cohorts of patients with treatment failure and relapse are needed."

Objective The aim of this article was to review the current literature on molecular diagnostics for TB with an emphasis on the performance of these diagnostic tests in the HIV-positive population. Methods We searched the PubMed database using at least one of the terms TB, HIV, diagnostics, Xpert MTB/RIF, nucleic acid amplification tests, drug susceptibility testing, RNA transcription, and drew on World Health Organization publications. Findings With increased focus on reducing TB prevalence worldwide, a new set of tools for diagnosing the disease have emerged. Molecular tools such as Xpert MTB/RIF and line-probe assays are now in use or are being rolled out in many regions. The diagnostic performance of these and other molecular assays are discussed here as they pertain to the HIV-positive population.

Host lipids are essential energy sources used by mycobacteria to persist in a latent TB state. A potential therapy targeting cholesterol catabolism of mycobacteria has been proposed, but the potential of cholesterol-lowering drugs as anti-TB therapy is unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ezetimibe, a 2-azetidinone cholesterol absorption inhibitor, on intracellular mycobacteria survival and dormancy. METHODS: Intracellular mycobacteria survival was determined by measurements of ATP activity and colony-formation units (CFUs). Gene expression profiles of hypoxia-induced dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) were analysed by real-time PCR. Flow cytometry and microscopy analysis were used to measure the lipid loads of human macrophages with or without ezetimibe treatment. QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-G-IT) assays were performed to diagnose latent TB infection. The levels of intracellular cholesterol/ triglyceride were measured by an enzymatic fluorometric method. RESULTS: Ezetimibe was capable of effectively lowering intracellular growth of Mtb and hypoxia-induced dormant Mtb. There was a significant decrease in Mtb growth in leucocytes from ezetimibe-treated patients with diabetes in terms of ATP levels of intracellular mycobacteria and CFU formation. Also, patients receiving ezetimibe therapy had a lower prevalence of latent TB and had lower intracellular lipid contents. CONCLUSION: Ezetimibe, which is a currently marketed drug, could hold promise as an adjunctive, host-directed therapy for TB."

Gene expression profiles based on blood signatures have proved useful in identifying genes that enable classification of TB patients, but have thus far been complex. Using real-time PCR analysis, we evaluated the expression profiles from a large panel of genes in TB patients and healthy individuals in an Indian cohort. Classification models were built and validated for their capacity to discriminate samples from TB patients and controls within this cohort and on external independent gene expression datasets. A combination of only four genes distinguished TB patients from healthy individuals in both cross-validations and on separate validation datasets with very high accuracy. An external validation on two distinct cohorts using a real-time PCR setting confirmed the predictive power of this 4-gene tool reaching sensitivity scores of 88% with a specificity of around 75%. Moreover, this gene signature demonstrated good classification power in HIV(+) populations and also between TB and several other pulmonary diseases. Here we present proof of concept that our 4-gene signature and the top classifier genes from our models provide excellent candidates for the development of molecular point-of-care TB diagnosis in endemic areas."

In this study, we report an infectious disease among 84 rhesus macaques at a Chinese zoo. Their clinical signs and symptoms were very similar with the manifestations of TB in humans. To determine the potential pathogens of this outbreak, many methods were used. First, tuberculin skin tests showed that none of the monkeys displayed significant skin reactions. Subsequently, the sera were tested for specific antibody IgG; 29 (34.5%) and 39 (46.4%) blood samples tested positive by TB-IgG and TB-DOT, respectively. Radiographic examination showed characteristic imageology changes in 14 (16.7%) monkeys. One individual determined as positive by the above three methods was euthanized, and histopathological analysis demonstrated typical granulomas and caseous necrosis in the lung, liver, spleen, and intestine. Furthermore, the pathogenic mycobacteria were isolated from lung lobe, cultured on acidic Lowenstein-Jensen culture medium, and identified as M. tuberculosis by real-time PCR and DNA sequencing. Nevertheless, the origin of the infection remained unknown. These findings emphasize the need to strengthen the management and training of staff, especially those working at animal shelters."

The private sector in India is an important source of TB care with over 50% of TB patients seeking TB treatment in the private health sector. Early and accurate diagnosis is the first critical step in controlling TB. All persons with cough lasting two weeks or more, or with unexplained chronic fever and/or weight loss should be evaluated for TB. For pulmonary TB, Sputum is the most critical sample for laboratory testing. Although blood is a popular sample in the Indian private sector, there is no accepted, valid blood test for pulmonary TB. There are three accepted, validated sputum tests for active TB: Sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli; molecular or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT); and culture. Chest radiography is useful but is not specific for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. Therefore, chest radiography cannot provide a conclusive diagnosis on its own, and needs to be followed by sputum testing. If sputum smears and NAATs are negative, and TB is still suspected, cultures are the most sensitive tests available for TB. Culture is therefore very useful in diagnosing smear-negative TB; and drug-resistant TB. Blood-based antibody tests (eg, IgG/IgM tests) and Interferon-gamma release assays (eg, TB Gold) are not accurate and should not be used for pulmonary TB diagnosis. In fact, use of serodiagnostic tests for TB is banned by the Government of India."

A bacteriophage-based method combined with PCR (phage-PCR) has been recently used to detect and identify viable pathogenic mycobacteria in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of animals suffering from paratuberculosis. To adapt this method for the detection of M. bovis in blood, a new isothermal DNA amplification protocol using Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) was developed and was found to be able to detect M. bovis BCG within 48h, with a limit of detection of approximately 10 cells per ml of blood for artificially inoculated blood samples. When blood samples (2ml) from a Single Comparative Cervical Intradermal Tuberculin (SCCIT)- negative beef herd were tested, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) cells were not detected from any (45) of the blood samples. However when blood samples from SCCIT-positive animals were tested, viable MTC bacteria were detected in 66 % (27/41) of samples. Of these 41 animals sampled, 32 % (13) had visible lesions. In the visible lesion (VL) group, 85 % (11/13) had detectable levels of MTC whereas only 57 % (16/28) of animals which had no visible lesions (NVL) were found to have detectable mycobacteraemia. These results indicated that this simple, rapid method can be applied for the study of M. bovis infections. The frequency with which viable mycobacteria were detected in the peripheral blood of SCCIT-positive animals changes the paradigm of this disease."

Recent reports suggest simple modifications to conventional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining may greatly improve sensitivity.

METHODS: In hospitals in Vietnam, South Africa and Indonesia we conducted a prospective study of modified ZN with or without cytospin, conventional ZN smear, GeneXpert, and culture on CSF in adults with suspected TBM. RESULTS: A total of 618 individuals were enrolled across 3 sites. Compared with the TBM clinical diagnostic gold standard for research (definite probable or possible TBM), sensitivity of conventional ZN and modified ZN with cytospin were 33.9% and 34.5% respectively (p=1.0 for the difference between tests), compared with culture 31.8% and Xpert 25.1%. Using culture as a reference, sensitivities of conventional ZN, modified ZN with cytospin, and Xpert were 66.4%, 67.5%, and 72.3%, respectively. Higher CSF volume and lactate, and lower CSF:blood glucose ratio were independently associated with microbiologically confirmed TBM. CONCLUSIONS: Modified ZN stain does not improve diagnosis of TBM. Currently available tests are insensitive, but testing large CSF volumes improves performance. New diagnostic tests for TBM are urgently required."

Many Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human biomarkers have been studied over the past decade. Present research focuses on three areas: biomarkers predicting treatment efficacy and cure of active tuberculosis, the reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection, and the induction of protective immune responses by vaccination. Many older, non-specific markers of inflammation, when considered in isolation, do not have sufficient predictive values for clinical use in tuberculosis. Although no new accurate, tuberculosis-specific biomarkers have yet been discovered, substantial progress has been made in some areas. However, the qualification of biomarkers as a surrogate for a clinical endpoint in tuberculosis is very challenging, and, for biomarkers that are non-culture-based, impossible to pursue without the availability of well characterised biobanks containing biospecimens from patients who have had adequate follow-up to establish long-term treatment outcome. We review progress in tuberculosis biomarker development and efforts being made to harness resources to meet future challenges."

Delay in diagnosis can have an impact on the patient's prognosis. METHODS: We evaluated the IFN- circuit by studying IFN- production after mycobacterial challenge as well as IL-12R1 expression and STAT4 phosphorylation in response to IL-12p70 stimulation in whole blood of a 6-year-old Peruvian girl with disseminated recurrent mycobacterial infection diagnosed as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Genetic studies with Sanger sequencing were used to identify the causative mutation. Microbiological studies based on PCR reactions were used to diagnose the specific mycobacterial species. RESULTS: We identified a homozygous mutation in the IL12RB1 gene (p. Arg211*) causing abolished expression of IL-12R1 and IL-12 response. MSMD diagnosis led to a microbiological reevaluation of the patient, revealing a BCG vaccine-related infection instead of tuberculosis. Treatment was then adjusted, with good response. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first Peruvian patient with IL-12R1 deficiency. Specific mycobacterial species diagnosis within Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex is still challenging in countries with limited access to PCR-based microbiological diagnostic techniques. Awareness of MSMD warning signs and accurate microbiological diagnosis of mycobacterial infections are of the utmost importance for optimal diagnosis and management of affected patients."

To assess the overall accuracy of the hRT-PCR assay for Mtb diagnosis in different samples for individuals with active pulmonary and extra-pulmonary Mtb infection, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. METHODS: The PUBMED, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched up to June 2017 for eligible studies that estimated diagnostic sensitivity and specificity with the hRT-PCR assay in respiratory and non-respiratory samples in pulmonary and extra-pulmonary Mtb infection patients, with Mtb culture as the reference standard. Bivariate random effect models were used to provide pooled estimation of diagnostic accuracy. Further, subgroup and meta-regression analyses were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity. The risk of bias was assessed by the QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS: Of the 3589 candidate studies, 18 eligible studies met our inclusion criteria. Compared to Mtb culture data, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.96 and 0.92, respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 192.96 (95% CI 68.46, 543.90), and the area under the summary ROC curve (AUC) was 0.9791. There was significant heterogeneity in sensitivity and specificity among the enrolled studies (p<0.001). The studies with high-quality assessment and application of respiratory specimen were associated with better accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: In low-income/high-burden settings, our results suggested that the hRT-PCR assay could be a useful test for the diagnosis of TB with high sensitivity and specificity."

However, there were few reports about bacterial sRNA as a biomarker of infection. To test the potential role of sRNA in indicating infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, total RNA were extracted from the filtrated bacterial cultural supernatant. After synthesis of cDNA by reverse transcription, four Mycobacterial sRNAs including ASdes, ASpks, AS1726, and AS1890, which have been experimentally confirmed by Kristine B in the year of 2009, were detected by real time PCR.

Our results suggest that bacterial non-coding sRNA can be detected from either bacterial culture supernatants or patient's plasma. Detecting of Mycobacterial sRNA provides a rapid and relatively noninvasive approach for diagnosing disease and could be developed as a biomarker to identify patients with active tuberculosis to help make informed decisions about proper therapies.(1)."

We developed a simple and efficient DNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocol for mycobacterial detection and quantification in paucibacillary specimens. The method was refined using an in vitro model mimicking blood specimens which are characterized by the presence of numerous qPCR inhibitors. Mycobacterial DNA detection in blood is of interest given the high sensitivity we previously reported using conventional PCR in blood of patients with tuberculosis lymphadenitis. Mechanical lysis of mycobacteria in the presence of an organic solvent provided the highest sensitivity. Mycobacterial DNA amplification was compromised when the human:bacterial genome ratio was at least 190:1. Separation of the specimen into bacterial- and host-rich fractions prior to DNA extraction improved mycobacterial DNA detection by 30%. Preliminary testing of our protocol in smear-negative, culture-positive specimens (gastric and lymph node aspirates, pleural and cerebrospinal fluid, and blood) confirmed the applicability of our technique to a range of paucibacillary specimens for the detection, quantification and speciation (M. tuberculosis versus M. avium) of mycobacteria, several weeks before culture results were available. Our protocol provides a novel, efficient and simple strategy to improve the performance of qPCR in paucibacillary specimens, including those with excess human DNA background. This tool is useful to study the pathophysiology of early pulmonary or occult tuberculosis, and for more rapid and accurate diagnosis in difficult to diagnose infections.  2006 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesised that M tuberculosis BSI prevalence has been underestimated, that it independently predicts death, and that sputum Xpert MTB/RIF has suboptimal diagnostic yield for M tuberculosis BSI. METHODS: We did a systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies performing routine mycobacterial blood culture in a prospectively defined patient population of people with HIV aged 13 years or older. Studies were identified through searching PubMed and Scopus up to Nov 10, 2018, without language or date restrictions and through manual review of reference lists. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed with an adapted QUADAS-2 framework. IPD were requested for all identified studies and subject to harmonised inclusion criteria: age 13 years or older, HIV positivity, available CD4 cell count, a valid mycobacterial blood culture result (excluding patients with missing data from lost or contaminated blood cultures), and meeting WHO definitions for suspected tuberculosis (presence of screening symptom). Predicted probabilities of M tuberculosis BSI from mixed-effects modelling were used to estimate prevalence. Estimates of diagnostic yield of sputum testing with Xpert (or culture if Xpert was unavailable) and of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing for M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by two-level random-effect meta-analysis. Estimates of mortality associated with M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by mixed-effect Cox proportional-hazard modelling and of effect of treatment delay on mortality by propensity-score analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number 42016050022. FINDINGS: We identified 23 datasets for inclusion (20 published and three unpublished at time of search) and obtained IPD from 20, representing 962% of eligible IPD. Risk of bias for the included studies was assessed to be generally low except for on the patient selection domain, which was moderate in most studies. 5751 patients met harmonised IPD-level inclusion criteria. Technical factors such as number of blood cultures done, timing of blood cultures relative to blood sampling, and patient factors such as inpatient setting and CD4 cell count, explained significant heterogeneity between primary studies. The predicted probability of M tuberculosis BSI in hospital inpatients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, WHO danger signs, and a CD4 count of 76 cells per L (the median for the cohort) was 45% (95% CI 38-52). The diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with M tuberculosis BSI was 77% (95% CI 63-87), increasing to 89% (80-94) when combined with urine LAM testing. Presence of M tuberculosis BSI compared with its absence in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis increased risk of death before 30 days (adjusted hazard ratio 248, 95% CI 205-308) but not after 30 days (125, 084-249). In a propensity-score matched cohort of participants with HIV-associated tuberculosis (n=630), mortality increased in patients with M tuberculosis BSI who had a delay in anti-tuberculosis treatment of longer than 4 days compared with those who had no delay (odds ratio 315, 95% CI 116-884). INTERPRETATION: In critically ill adults with HIV-tuberculosis, M tuberculosis BSI is a frequent manifestation of tuberculosis and predicts mortality within 30 days. Improved diagnostic yield in patients with M tuberculosis BSI could be achieved through combined use of sputum Xpert and urine LAM. Anti-tuberculosis treatment delay might increase the risk of mortality in these patients. FUNDING: This study was supported by Wellcome fellowships 109105Z/15/A and 105165/Z/14/A."

Of the numerous recommendations, a few are summarized here. Chest computed tomography as well as bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with suspicion of pulmonary invasive aspergillosis (IA) are strongly recommended. For diagnosis, direct microscopy, preferably using optical brighteners, histopathology and culture are strongly recommended. Serum and BAL galactomannan measures are recommended as markers for the diagnosis of IA. PCR should be considered in conjunction with other diagnostic tests. Pathogen identification to species complex level is strongly recommended for all clinically relevant Aspergillus isolates; antifungal susceptibility testing should be performed in patients with invasive disease in regions with resistance found in contemporary surveillance programmes. Isavuconazole and voriconazole are the preferred agents for first-line treatment of pulmonary IA, whereas liposomal amphotericin B is moderately supported. Combinations of antifungals as primary treatment options are not recommended. Therapeutic drug monitoring is strongly recommended for patients receiving posaconazole suspension or any form of voriconazole for IA treatment, and in refractory disease, where a personalized approach considering reversal of predisposing factors, switching drug class and surgical intervention is also strongly recommended. Primary prophylaxis with posaconazole is strongly recommended in patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving induction chemotherapy. Secondary prophylaxis is strongly recommended in high-risk patients. We strongly recommend treatment duration based on clinical improvement, degree of immunosuppression and response on imaging."

Methods PBMCs of patients with PTB and healthy children were collected and separated. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect mRNA expression level of miR-125b and RAF1, and Western blotting was used to detect the protein level of RAF1. THP-1 macrophages were transfected into miR-125b mimic, negative control mimic (NC-mimic), miR-125b inhibitor and negative control inhibitor (NC-inhibitor), which were cultured for 48 hours. Western blotting was performed to observe the expression of RAF1 in THP-1 macrophages, annexin V-FITC/PI double staining combined with flow cytometry was used to test cell apoptosis, and CCK-8 assay was used to detect cell proliferation. Results The expression of miR-125b in PBMCs in pediatric patients with PTB was downregulated, and mRNA and protein levels of RAF1 were upregulated. When miR-125b was over-expressed in THP-1 macrophages, the expression of RAF1 was reduced to promote the apoptosis of macrophages and decrease cell activity; when the expression of miR-125b was inhibited in THP-1 macrophages, the expression of RAF1 was elevatedand the apoptosis of macrophages was inhibited, the cell activity was promoted. Conclusion In PBMCs of children with PTB, miR-125b level is low. Upregulation of miR-125b in THP-1 macrophages, the apoptosis of THP-1 macrophages is promoted and cell activity is inhibited."

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the 3-gene TB score can be a diagnostic tool throughout the course of TB disease, from latency to diagnosis to treatment response, and posttreatment residual inflammation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nested case-control study analyzed the 3-gene TB score in 3 cohorts, each focusing on a different stage of TB disease: (1) the Adolescent Cohort Study profiled whole-blood samples from adolescents with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, some of which progressed to active TB (ATB), using RNA sequencing; (2) the Brazil Active Screen Study collected whole blood from an actively screened case-control cohort of adult inmates from 2 prisons in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, for ATB from January 2016 to February 2016; and (3) the Catalysis Treatment Response Cohort (CTRC) identified culture-positive adults in primary health care clinics in Cape Town, South Africa, from 2005 to 2007 and collected whole blood for RNA sequencing from patients with ATB at diagnosis and weeks 1, 4, and 24. The CTRC patients also had positron emission tomography-computed tomography scans at diagnosis, week 4, and week 24. Analyses were performed from September 2017 to June 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A 3-gene messenger RNA expression score, measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction or RNA sequencing, was evaluated for distinguishing the following: individuals who progressed to ATB from those who did not, individuals with ATB from those without, and individuals with slower treatment response during TB therapy. RESULTS: Patients evaluated in this study included 144 adolescents from the Adolescent Cohort Study (aged 12-18 years; 96 female and 48 male), 81 adult prison inmates from the Brazil Active Screen Study (aged 20-72 years; 81 male), and 138 adult community members from the CTRC (aged 17-64 years; 81 female and 57 male). The 3-gene TB score identified progression from latent M tuberculosis infection to ATB 6 months prior to sputum conversion with 86% sensitivity and 84% specificity (area under the curve [AUC], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77-0.96) and patients with ATB in the Brazil Active Screen Study cohort (AUC, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.95) and CTRC (AUC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88-0.99). It also identified CTRC patients with failed treatment at the end of treatment (AUC, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83-1.00). Collectively, across all cohorts, the 3-gene TB score identified patients with ATB with 90% sensitivity, 70% specificity, and 99.3% negative predictive value at 4% prevalence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Across 3 independent prospective cohorts, the 3-gene TB score approaches the World Health Organization target product profile benchmarks for non-sputum-based triage test with high negative predictive value. This gene expression diagnostic approach should be considered for further validation and future implementation."

Failure to accurately identify cases of active MTB has serious effects on both patients and the community. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear has poor sensitivity and culture methods have a delay ranging from 1 to 8 weeks for diagnosis. Nucleic acid amplification assays may be suitable candidates for this purpose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, we evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in 190 patients with pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis whom were admitted to Tehran Imam Khomeini hospitals during 2006-2010. Three ml citrated blood samples were obtained from cases. DNA extraction was performed by QIAGEN commercial kit and PCR performed with IS1081 Primer. RESULTS: Fifty six cases had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and 134 were pulmonary. Overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 41.1% and 95.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MTB-PCR assay on PBMC using IS1081 primer has a low sensitivity and now can not use as a single or alternative diagnostic test for tuberculosis. However, with regard to its high specificity can use for help diagnosing of TB in cases have no enough sputum (or other specimens) to examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture."

Methods: The relative serum levels of 10 miRNAs in 120 patients with NSCLC, 45 patients with benign lung diseases, and 45 healthy controls were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were then used to analyze the significance of the expression of these 10 miRNAs in the diagnosis of NSCLC, as well as to compare them with the current commonly used tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Results: The serum levels of miR-125b and miR-22 in the NSCLC patients were significantly higher than those in the other two groups (p < 0.05), but the serum expression of miR-15b in the NSCLC patients was significantly lower than that in the other two groups (p < 0.01). The sensitivities of serum miR-22 and miR-15b in detecting early NSCLC (stage I + II) were significantly higher than that of CEA (p < 0.05). Area under the curves (AUCs) of serum miR-22, miR-125b, and miR-15b in the diagnosis of NSCLC were 0.725, 0.704, and 0.619, respectively, and the diagnostic significance of these three serum miRNAs for NSCLC was higher than that of serum CEA (AUC = 0.594). Conclusions: Serum miRNAs have potential as NSCLC-screening tumor markers, and serum miR-22 and miR-15b might be used as reference indexes for the early diagnosis of NSCLC in the future."

The prevalence of complement receptor 1 genotypes and the association between circulating immune complexes and expression of complement receptor 1 on erythrocytes in pulmonary tuberculosis are not fully understood. Observations from this study showed increased occurrence of HH genotype in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis had decreased erythrocyte complement receptor 1 and increased immune complex levels compared to healthy controls which also correlated with increasing severity of the disease. In addition, the expression of complement receptor 1 on erythrocytes correlated inversely with the levels of circulating immune complexes. This study suggests that the presence of HH genotype is high in pulmonary tuberculosis patients and the reduced complement receptor 1 in patients may be an acquired phenomenon related to disease pathogenesis."

We determined their prevalence among bacteriologically negative and bacteriologically confirmed TB patients in five regional referral hospitals in Uganda. This cross-sectional study considered 1,862 adult presumptive TB participants. We performed fluorescent microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), Lowenstein-Jensen culture, human immunodeficiency virus, and random blood sugar testing on recruited patients. Prevalence and prevalence ratios of risk factors were compared among bacteriologically negative and confirmed cases. Odds ratios and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined for significant risk factors in bacteriologically confirmed patients. Of the 1,862 participants, 978 (55%) were male and the median age of the participants was 36 years (interquartile range: 27-48). Up to 273 (15%) had a positive result on all three TB tests. Most prevalent risk factors (prevalence ratio [PR] > 1.0) among bacteriologically negative and positive TB patients were cigarette smoking (9.3% versus 2.1%; PR = 2.1), biosmoke (24% versus 39.7%; PR = 1.7), contact (4.2% versus 6.5%; PR = 1.6), male gender (51.4% versus 72.5%; PR = 1.4), alcohol use (17.2% versus 24.4%; PR = 1.4), diabetes (0.7% versus 0.9%; PR = 1.3), and family history of TB (12.1% versus 13.7%; PR = 1.1). The risk factors and their adjusted prevalence rate ratios (95% CI) of being bacteriologically positive were male (1.8 [1.4-2.4]), biosmoke exposure (1.5 [1.2-2.0]), and history of cigarette smoking (1.6 [1.1-2.4]). Among bacteriologically confirmed patients in Uganda, cigarette smoking, biosmoke exposure, contact, male gender, alcohol use, diabetes, and family history of TB are important risk factors for TB. Interventions for TB control in people with these risk factors would help in TB control efforts."

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is presently seen as a promising alternative to conventional smear microscopy and culture techniques. Undiagnosed fever is a condition where the aetiology could include tuberculosis in a significant percentage. This paper evaluates a nested PCR (nPCR) using Hotstar Taq for the detection of M. tuberculosis in patients with febrile illness using insertion element, IS6110 as a target. Material and Methods: A total of 355 samples (301 HIV status unknown and 54 HIV seropositives) from patients primarily with febrile illness were tested for the presence of M. tuberculosis. Blood culture was done in a commercial automated blood culture system and nPCR in DNA extracts from buffy coat samples. Hotstar Taq polymerase was used to enhance the sensitivity of nPCR and the lower limit of detection was determined by using cloned plasmid. Results: Among the patients tested, 2% were positive by automated culture system and 6.8% of patients were positive by nPCR. Majority of the positives were from HIV seropositive individuals. The sensitivity of the nPCR was 100% and the specificity was 95.1%. The lower limit of detection was less than 1 genome copy per microlitre. Among the nPCR positives, patients from rural community were significantly higher than from the peri-urban community. Conclusions: The nPCR had a high sensitivity and specificity on buffy coat samples using Hotstar Taq polymerase in the reaction mix. Thus the technique is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of tuberculosis."

Consistent with their phylogenetically conserved characteristics, MAIT cells have been implicated in host immune responses to microbial infections and non-infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and multiple sclerosis. To date, MAIT cells have been identified in humans, mice, cows, sheep, and several non-human primates, but not in pigs. Here, we cloned porcine MAIT (pMAIT) TCR sequences from PBMC cDNA, and then analyzed the TCR usage of pMAIT cells expressing the TRAV1-TRAJ33 chain, finding that pMAIT cells use a limited array of TCR chains (predominantly TRBV20S and TRBV29S). We estimated the frequency of TRAV1-TRAJ33 transcripts in peripheral blood and tissues, demonstrating that TRAV1-TRAJ33 transcripts are expressed in all tested tissues. Analysis of the expression of TRAV1-TRAJ33 transcripts in three T-cell subpopulations from peripheral blood and tissues showed that TRAV1-TRAJ33 transcripts can be expressed by CD4(+)CD8(-), CD8(+)CD4(-), and CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells. Using a single-cell PCR assay, we demonstrated that pMAIT cells with the TRAV1-TRAJ33 chain express cell surface markers IL-18R, IL-7R, CCR9, CCR5, and/or CXCR6, and transcription factors PLZF, and T-bet and/or RORt. In conclusion, pMAIT cells expressing the TRAV1-TRAJ33 chain have characteristics similar to human and mouse MAIT cells, further supporting the idea that the pig is an animal model for investigating MAIT cell functions in human disease."

Nineteen differentially expressed proteins were identified preliminarily, and western blotting and qRT-PCR were performed to confirm these changes at the translational and transcriptional levels, respectively, using samples from 122 additional pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 73 additional healthy controls. Two proteins, mannose-binding lectin 2 and a 35-kDa fragment of inter--trypsin inhibitor H4, exhibited the highest differential expression. We constructed a protein-microRNA interaction network that primarily involved complement and inflammatory responses. Eleven microRNAs from microRNA-target protein interactions were screened and validated using qRT-PCR with some of the above samples, including 97 pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 48 healthy controls. Only miR-625-3p exhibited significant differential expression (p<0.05). miR-625-3p was increased to a greater extent in samples of smear-positive than smear-negative patients. miR-625-3p was predicted to target mannose-binding lectin 2 protein. A binary logistic regression model based on miR-625-3p, mannose-binding lectin 2, and inter--trypsin inhibitor H4 was further established. This three-biomarker combination exhibited better performance for tuberculosis diagnosis than individual biomarkers or any two-biomarker combination and generated a diagnostic sensitivity of 85.87% and a specificity of 87.50%. These novel urine biomarkers may significantly improve tuberculosis diagnosis."

To understand the immune processes underlying concordant or discordant TST and QFTGIT results, we analyzed immune responses in children from Palamaner Taluk in India (a TB-endemic region with routine neonatal BCG vaccination) who were referred to a TB case verification ward on suspicion of TB. Two hundred and ten children aged <3 years were classified according to their TST and QFTGIT results, and their immune responses analyzed by dual-colour-Reverse-Transcriptase-Multiple-Ligation-dependent-Probe-Amplification, using a panel of 45 genes and a 10-plex antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We show that immune biomarkers FPR1, TNFRSF1A and interferon (IFN)- are upregulated (all P<0.05) in concordant test-positive children, whereas BPI is downregulated (P<0.05). In contrast, SEC14L1 (P=0.034) and Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) (P=0.001) are differentially expressed between the TST+QFTGIT- /TST-QFTGIT+ groups. Known TB exposure was more frequent in concordant positive children and results were consistent with elevated expression of genes associated with inflammatory responses. Children with discordant test results displayed a mixed profile with activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory markers. TST and/or QFTGIT positivity appears to reflect distinct but overlapping aspects of host immunity."

We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the screening rule among people living with HIV based on antiretroviral therapy (ART) status and the added contribution of chest radiography. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from Jan 1, 2011, to March 12, 2018, for studies published after the WHO issued recommendations on the use of the four-symptom screening rule. We also searched abstracts from relevant international conferences. We included studies that collected sputum or any specimens (eg, urine, blood, or fine-needle aspirates from lymph nodes) from people with HIV regardless of signs or symptoms. Case-control studies were excluded because they are prone to bias. Active tuberculosis was diagnosed with bacteriological confirmation by culture or Xpert MTB/RIF of any specimens. Two investigators extracted the data, including age, sex, and ART status. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and 95% CI. When at least four studies were available, we estimated pooled sensitivity and specificity using random and effects bivariate models; otherwise we used univariate random-effects models. FINDINGS: Of 4615 records identified by the search, 21 were included in the review (involving 15427 people including 1559 with active tuberculosis). 18 eligible studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Seven studies provided data on people receiving ART. The pooled sensitivity of the four-symptom screening rule was lower for 4640 people on ART (510%, 95% CI 284-732) than for 8664 who were ART-naive (894%, 830-935). Pooled specificity for those on ART was 707% (95% CI 478-864) and for ART-naive people was 281% (186-401). On the basis of data from 646 individuals in two studies, the addition of any abnormal chest radiographic findings in people on ART improved sensitivity from 522% (95% CI 380-660) to 846% (697-929) but decreased specificity from 555% (95% CI 518-592) to 298% (263-336). INTERPRETATION: Our review suggested a lower sensitivity of the WHO four-symptom screening rule among people with HIV who are on ART than in those who are ART naive. The addition of chest radiography could improve the screening rule in people living with HIV who are on ART, provided it does not pose a barrier to preventive treatment. FUNDING: None."

However, there are still many issues that need to be addressed as no point-of-care tests are yet available. Furthermore, no tests are available which are universally applicable to all patients. Improvements in the microbiological and molecular-based approaches are promising and the diagnostic pipeline is encouraging. Host markers associated with active disease may hold promise, especially in situations where sputum diagnostics are problematic, including in children, HIV-infected individuals and in the case of extrapulmonary TB."

Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccine is administered at birth to protect infants against tuberculosis throughout Africa, where most perinatal HIV-1 transmission occurs. We examined whether BCG vaccination alters the levels of activated HIV target T cells in HIV-exposed South African infants. METHODS. HIV-exposed infants were randomized to receive routine (at birth) or delayed (at 8 weeks) BCG vaccination. Activated and CCR5-expressing peripheral blood CD4(+) T cell, monocyte, and NK cell frequencies were evaluated by flow cytometry and immune gene expression via PCR using Biomark (Fluidigm). RESULTS. Of 149 infants randomized, 92% (n = 137) were retained at 6 weeks: 71 in the routine BCG arm and 66 in the delayed arm. Routine BCG vaccination led to a 3-fold increase in systemic activation of HIV target CD4(+)CCR5(+) T cells (HLA-DR(+)CD38(+)) at 6 weeks (0.25% at birth versus 0.08% in delayed vaccination groups; P = 0.029), which persisted until 8 weeks of age when the delayed arm was vaccinated. Vaccination of the infants in the delayed arm at 8 weeks resulted in a similar increase in activated CD4(+)CCR5(+) T cells. The increase in activated T cells was associated with increased levels of MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), IL12RB1, and IFN-1 transcripts within peripheral blood mononuclear cells but minimal changes in innate cells. CONCLUSION. BCG vaccination induces immune changes in HIV-exposed infants, including an increase in the proportion of activated CCR5(+)CD4(+) HIV target cells. These findings provide insight into optimal BCG vaccine timing to minimize the risks of HIV transmissions to exposed infants while preserving potential benefits conferred by BCG vaccination.

Blood culture is the gold-standard diagnostic test, but is expensive, slow, and may under-diagnose TB dissemination. In a cohort of hospitalised HIV patients, we aimed to report the prevalence of TB-blood-culture positivity, performance of rapid diagnostics as diagnostic surrogates, and better characterise the clinical phenotype of disseminated TB. HIV-inpatients were systematically investigated using sputum, urine and blood testing. Overall, 132/410 (32.2%) patients had confirmed TB; 41/132 (31.1%) had a positive TB blood culture, of these 9/41 (22.0%) died within 90-days. In contrast to sputum diagnostics, urine Xpert and urine-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) combined identified 88% of TB blood-culture-positive patients, including 9/9 who died within 90-days. For confirmed-TB patients, half the variation in major clinical variables was captured on two principle components (PCs). Urine Xpert, urine LAM and TB-blood-culture positive patients clustered similarly on these axes, distinctly from patients with localised disease. Total number of positive tests from urine Xpert, urine LAM and MTB-blood-culture correlated with PCs (p<0.001 for both). PC1&PC2 independently predicted 90-day mortality (ORs 2.6, 95%CI=1.3-6.4; and 2.4, 95%CI=1.3-4.5, respectively). Rather than being a non-specific diagnosis, disseminated TB is a distinct, life-threatening condition, which can be diagnosed using rapid urine-based tests, and warrants specific interventional trials."

In patients with different forms of tuberculosis, varying degrees of T cell function--ranging from positive delayed-type hypersensitivity, in asymptomatic infected healthy individuals, to the absence of the response, in patients with miliary or pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB)--have been reported. The decreased expression of CD3zeta reported in T cells from patients with either cancer or leprosy has provided possible explanations for the altered immune response observed in these diseases. METHODS: The present study aimed to compare the expression of CD3zeta , nuclear transcription factor- kappa B (NF- kappa B), arginase activity, and cytokine production in 20 patients with PTB, in 20 tuberculin-positive asymptomatic subjects, and in 14 tuberculin-negative control subjects. RESULTS: Compared with those in tuberculin (purified protein derivative)-negative control subjects, peripheral-blood T lymphocytes from patients with active PTB had significantly (P < .001) decreased expression of CD3zeta and absence of the p65/p50 heterodimer of NF- kappa B. These alterations were reversed only in patients who responded to treatment. Also reported here for the first time is that the presence of arginase activity in peripheral-blood mononuclear-cell lysates of patients with PTB parallels high production of interleukin-10. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of arginase could, in part, explain the decreased expression of CD3zeta . These findings provide a novel mechanism that may explain the T cell dysfunction observed in patients with PTB."

The impact of DM on TB specific adaptive immune responses remains poorly addressed, particularly in people living in Sub-Saharan countries. We performed a functional characterization of TB specific cellular immune response in Tanzanian subjects with active or latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection stratified by their diabetic status. METHODS: HIV negative active TB patients (18 years) with Xpert MTB/RIF positive pulmonary TB were included before starting TB treatment in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania between April and December 2013. HIV negative healthy controls latently infected with TB but without past TB history were also included. Active and latent TB patients were stratified in two groups according to their diabetic status. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells were stimulated with either live M. bovis BCG or Mtb-specific peptide pools and analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining and polychromatic flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our results show a lower frequency of IFN- CD4(+) T cells in patients with active TB and DM compared to patients with active TB only after live M. bovis BCG (p=0.04) but not after Mtb peptide pools re-stimulation. Irrespective of TB status, level of glycaemia is selectively inversely correlated with IFN- and TNF- CD4(+) T cell production (p=0.02 and p=0.03) after live M. bovis BCG stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that hyperglycaemia negatively impacts antigen processing and/or presentation of whole mycobacteria delaying secretion of key cytokines involved in TB immunity."

Mortality after ART initiation is high in these patients, and tuberculosis and invasive bacterial diseases are common causes of death. METHODS: We conducted a 48-week trial of empirical treatment for tuberculosis as compared with treatment guided by testing in HIV-infected adults who had not previously received ART and had CD4+ T-cell counts below 100 cells per cubic millimeter. Patients recruited in Ivory Coast, Uganda, Cambodia, and Vietnam were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo screening (Xpert MTB/RIF test, urinary lipoarabinomannan test, and chest radiography) to determine whether treatment for tuberculosis should be started or to receive systematic empirical treatment with rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide daily for 2 months, followed by rifampin and isoniazid daily for 4 months. The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause or invasive bacterial disease within 24 weeks (primary analysis) or within 48 weeks after randomization. RESULTS: A total of 522 patients in the systematic-treatment group and 525 in the guided-treatment group were included in the analyses. At week 24, the rate of death from any cause or invasive bacterial disease (calculated as the number of first events per 100 patient-years) was 19.4 with systematic treatment and 20.3 with guided treatment (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.44). At week 48, the corresponding rates were 12.8 and 13.3 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.67 to 1.40]). At week 24, the probability of tuberculosis was lower with systematic treatment than with guided treatment (3.0% vs. 17.9%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.26), but the probability of grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events was higher with systematic treatment (17.4% vs. 7.2%; adjusted hazard ratio 2.57; 95% CI, 1.75 to 3.78). Serious adverse events were more common with systematic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Among severely immunosuppressed adults with HIV infection who had not previously received ART, systematic treatment for tuberculosis was not superior to test-guided treatment in reducing the rate of death or invasive bacterial disease over 24 or 48 weeks and was associated with more grade 3 or 4 adverse events.

DATA SOURCES: Review of the English-language literature. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of both NAA tests is excellent (sensitivity, > or = 95%; specificity, 100%) when testing respiratory specimens that are smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Only the Gen-Probe assay is approved for testing respiratory specimens regardless of the AFB smear result. Data from 3 studies showed that the sensitivity of the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test in smear-negative patients ranged from 83% to 85%, and that the specificity was 99%. Both NAA tests have been used to test nonrespiratory specimens; in some studies, the performance was comparable to the performance obtained for respiratory specimens, whereas in others, it was lower. The NAA tests also appear to be reliable tools for rapid detection of M tuberculosis complex in positive broth cultures of all specimen types (except blood). The impact of the NAA tests on patient outcome varies based on the result of the AFB smear. In smear-positive patients, public health and hospital infection-control resources are predominantly affected. The potential for influencing patient outcome is much greater when the AFB smear is negative. In smear-negative patients, the NAA test could provide more rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and subsequent initiation of therapy; eliminate the need for invasive diagnostic procedures, which are both costly and pose an added risk to the patient; and allow earlier discharge of hospitalized patients. Prospective studies concerning the cost-effectiveness of the NAA tests are needed."

We determined the overall prevalence and predictors of TB among consecutive unselected HIV-positive adults requiring acute hospital admission and the comparative diagnostic yield obtained by screening urine and sputum samples obtained on day 1 of admission with Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert). METHODS: To determine overall TB prevalence accurately, comprehensive clinical sampling (sputum, urine, blood plus other relevant samples) was done and TB was defined by detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in any sample using Xpert and/or mycobacterial liquid culture. To evaluate a rapid screening strategy, we compared the diagnostic yield of Xpert testing sputum samples and urine samples obtained with assistance from a respiratory study nurse in the first 24 h of admission. RESULTS: Unselected HIV-positive acute adult new medical admissions (n = 427) who were not receiving TB treatment were enrolled irrespective of clinical presentation or symptom profile. From 2,391 cultures and Xpert tests done (mean, 5.6 tests/patient) on 1,745 samples (mean, 4.1 samples/patient), TB was diagnosed in 139 patients (median CD4 cell count, 80 cells/L). TB prevalence was very high (32.6 %; 95 % CI, 28.1-37.2 %; 139/427). However, patient symptoms and risk factors were poorly predictive for TB. Overall, 1 non-respiratory sample(s) tested positive in 115/139 (83 %) of all TB cases, including positive blood cultures in 41/139 (29.5 %) of TB cases. In the first 24 h of admission, sputum (spot and/or induced samples) and urine were obtainable from 37.0 % and 99.5 % of patients, respectively (P <0.001). From these, the proportions of total TB cases (n = 139) that were diagnosed by Xpert testing sputum, urine or both sputum and urine combined within the first 24 h were 39/139 (28.1 %), 89/139 (64.0 %) and 108/139 (77.7 %) cases, respectively (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The very high prevalence of active TB and its non-specific presentation strongly suggest the need for routine microbiological screening for TB in all HIV-positive medical admissions in high-burden settings. The incremental diagnostic yield from Xpert testing urine was very high and this strategy might be used to rapidly screen new admissions, especially if sputum is difficult to obtain."

This is often not possible in children due to pauci-bacillary nature of illness. Significant improvement in understanding of molecular biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has led to development of newer diagnostic techniques of tuberculosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosis of TB in children. However, its role in day-to-day clinical practice needs to be defined. A negative PCR never eliminates possibility of tuberculosis, and a positive result is not always confirmatory. The PCR may be useful in evaluating children with significant pulmonary disease when diagnosis is not readily established by other means, and in evaluating immunocompromised children (HIV infection) with pulmonary disease. In the absence of good diagnostic methods for tuberculosis, a lot of interest has been generated in serodiagnosis. ELISA has been used to detect antibodies to various purified or complex antigens of M. tuberculosis in children. Despite a large number of studies published over the past several years, serology has found little place in the routine diagnosis of tuberculosis in children, even though it is rapid and does not require specimen from the site of disease. Sensitivity and specificity depend on the antigen used, gold standard for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and the type of tubercular infection. Though most of these tests have high specificity, their sensitivity is poor. In addition, these tests may be influenced by factors such as age, prior BCG vaccination and exposure to environmental mycobacteria. The serological tests, theoretically, may not be able to differentiate between infection and disease. At present, serodiagnosis does not appear to have any role in diagnosis of childhood pulmonary tuberculosis. A new test (QuantiFERON-TB or QFT) that measures the release of interferon-gamma in whole blood in response to stimulation by purified protein derivative is comparable with the tuberculin skin testing to detect latent tubercular infection, and is less affected by BCG vaccination. It can also discriminate responses due to nontuberculous mycobacteria, and avoids variability and subjectivity associated with placing and reading the tuberculin skin test. Polymerase chain reaction based test for identification of katG and rpoB mutation which are associated with isoniazid and rifampicin resistance may help in early identification of drug resistance in mycobacterium."

Circulating microRNAs are very stable and have shown potential as biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. microRNA-208b expression was increased in the blood of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and has been proposed as a biomarker for early diagnosis. In this pilot study, we investigate the potential of circulating miR-208b as a prognostic biomarker of 6-month survival in AMI patients. METHODS: Plasma samples from 21 patients and 8 age- and gender-matched healthy adults were collected, and circulating levels of miR-208b were detected using quantitative real-time PCR. RESULTS: miR-208b levels were higher in healthy control subjects (9.6-fold; P  0.05). Within the AMI patients, the levels of miR-208b were significantly lower in the survivor versus nonsurvivor group (fold change=6.51 and 14.1, resp.; P  0.05). The Kaplan-Meier curve revealed that the 6-month survival time was significantly higher among AMI patients with a relative expression of miR-208b lower than 12.38. The hazard ratio (HR) for the relative expression of miR-208b (<12.38 was the reference) was 5.08 (95% CI: 1.13-22.82; P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that elevated miR-208b expression was associated with reduced long-term survival in AMI patients. These pilot data indicate the need for a large follow-up study to confirm whether miR-208b can be used as a predictor of 6-month survival time after AMI."

Blood proteins are important diagnostic constituents in gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, and infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare serum protein profiles of domestic pigeons (Columba livia var. domestica) infected with Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (MAA), with healthy pigeons. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 80 pigeons with clinical signs of tuberculosis, all kept in the same loft. All birds were necropsied and cultured for mycobacteriosis; positive cultures were typed for MAA by PCR reactions targeting 16S rRNA, IS901 and IS1245. The concentration of total serum proteins was determined by the biuret method and spectrophotometry. Individual protein fractions were analyzed by cellulose acetate electrophoresis and extrapolated based on total protein concentration. For statistical analysis, the infected birds were compared with healthy pigeons. RESULTS: A total of 37 pigeons with culture results positive for MAA were selected and allocated to 2 groups, a culture-positive group with macroscopic lesions of tuberculosis and another without macroscopic lesions. Six protein fractions were identified: prealbumin, albumin, alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta globulins and gamma globulins. Concentrations of total protein, beta globulins and gamma globulins were statistically significantly higher in the infected pigeons when compared with the control group. There were no significant differences between the groups of birds with or without macroscopic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant differences in total protein, and beta and gamma globulin concentrations in all infected pigeons suggest that serum protein electrophoresis represents a nonspecific but valuable indicator for tuberculosis in pigeons."

Heparinized blood, serum and fecal samples were collected at regular time intervals for mycobacteria-specific IFN- release assays, antibody analysis and for Map culture respectively. Single intradermal skin test (SIT) with bovine tuberculin (PPD-B) was performed on day 115 and animals were sacrificed on day 133 after M. bovis infection. Organs were collected and stored for histopathological examination, modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining and bacteriological analysis of M. bovis and Map by culture and RT-PCR. Prior to infection five animals showed positive IFN- responses to avian PPD (PPD-A) and four were positive in Map PCR (IS900) on faeces. Three M. bovis infected animals reacted as early as day 14 with sustained higher PPD-B than PPD-A specific IFN- responses, whereas the fourth animal (with the strongest PPD-A response prior to infection) showed sustained higher PPD-B specific IFN- levels only a day 56 after infection. Two of the infected animals had a sustained positive IFN- response to the ESAT-6/CFP-10/TB7.7 (QuantiFERON()-TB Gold) peptide cocktail as early as day 14, among which the animal with the initial high PPD-A response. Later during infection, positive responses were found to ESAT-6 peptides in three infected bulls and to CFP-10 peptides in all four infected bulls. One of the control animals reacted intermittently to the ESAT-6/CFP10/TB7.7 cocktail. Prior to SIT, weak but positive MPB83/MBP70 specific antibody responses were detected in two of the infected bulls. All four M. bovis infected bulls reacted with a positive skin test and showed, as reported by others, increased mycobacteria specific IFN- production and increased positive responses in MPB83/MBP70 specific serology after SIT. At autopsy, M. bovis lesions were detected in all four experimentally infected bulls. Our results indicate that in Map exposed cattle, M. bovis diagnosis using IFN- assays needs a combination of PPD-B/A and ESAT-6/CFP10 for early and optimal sensitivity and that sensitivity of MPB83/MBP70 serodiagnosis is dramatically increased by prior skin testing. Map exposure did not interfere with the development of SIT in M. bovis infected animals, but resulted in a false positive M. bovis specific IFN- and antibody response after SIT in one of the two control animals (which remained negative in skin-test)."

Initial multicenter studies involving hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) revealed serious problems in specificity (false-positive rates of ca. 40%) and sensitivity, large variations in quantitative results, and a plethora of units (largely not comparable between assays). The problem areas identified included the need for standardized reagents and common units, contamination control mechanisms, inhibition control mechanisms, genotype-independent detection and quantitation, facilitated nucleic acid isolation procedures, clinically relevant dynamic ranges, and internal run controls. Progress made in each of these areas will be discussed. In addition to the above-mentioned problem areas, the value of external quality control of existing and evolving NATs was recognized. To this end, the European Union Quality Control Concerted Action for Nucleic Acid Amplification in Diagnostic Virology was established in May 1998. During its three-and-a-half years of existence, a total of 14 proficiency panels containing 8-13 well-characterized, simulated clinical samples of various viral loads and genotypes were prepared for herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus), blood-borne viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV-1), enteroviruses, and Chlamydia trachomatis, distributed to up to 20 different countries, and tested by up to 97 different laboratories. The results show dramatic improvement in specificity (false-positive rates <3% for most panels), presumably due to a generally greater expertise of participating laboratories, more frequent use of enzymatic or mechanical contamination control mechanisms, and increased utilization of standardized reagents (commercial kits). However, considerable problems with sensitivity remain (false-negative rates up to 50%), reflecting the high detection limits of some commercial viral load kits still on the market as well as inadequate standardization of quantitation controls between assay systems. In conclusion, although considerable progress has been made, quality control of NATs in clinical diagnosis remains an ongoing challenge."

The clinical presentation is often atypical in immunocompromised persons. In general, the extent of the disease is underestimated by the clinical presentation. X-ray and a sequential investigation of three samples of sputum including microscopy, culture and susceptibility testing for the first-line drugs should be obtained.

IL-37, a novel member of the IL-1 family, has anti-inflammatory activity. Various cytokine genes polymorphisms are reportedly associated with susceptibility to TB infection. However, an association between genetic variations in the IL-37 gene and susceptibility to TB infection has not been investigated. The aim of this case-control study was therefore to identify such an association in Saudi subjects, in which five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-37 gene were assessed. Serum concentrations of IL-37 were evaluated using ELISA, and genetic variants genotyped by multiplex PCR and ligase detection reaction. It was found that the C/C genotype of rs2723176 (-6962 A/C) occurs significantly more frequently in patients with active TB and that the C allele of this SNP is associated with TB. In addition, the C allele of rs2723176 SNP was associated with high circulating concentrations of IL-37. However, the genotype and allele frequency of the other four SNPs (rs3811046, rs3811047, rs2723186 and rs2723187) were not significantly associated with TB infection. In conclusion, the present data suggest that rs2723176 SNP of IL-37 is involved in the development of TB infection. Furthermore, high circulating concentrations of IL-37 may have a negative effect on protective immunity against TB infection."

This study investigated mycobacterial infection in two native deer species Cervus unicolor swinhoei (Formosan Sambar, Sambar) and C. nippon taiouanus (Formasan Sika, Sika). METHODS: Based on different sampling sources of 19 intradermal tuberculin test (ITT) Sambar, mycobacterial infection and/or species were detected by acid-fast stain, duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiplex nested PCR (mnPCR) methods, traditional mycobacterial culture and gross lesion. Blood samples of 167 Sambar deer and 147 Sika deer were then tested by duplex PCR and mnPCR methods to investigate the prevalence of mycobacterial infection. Sequence variations of these mycobacterial species were analyzed as well. RESULTS: Duplex PCR and mnPCR assays could differentiate between MTBC (M. bovis and M. tuberculosis) and M. avium, as well as between M. bovis and M. tuberculosis, respectively. These PCR methods showed a higher detection rate than traditional culture and matched the gross lesions examined in 19 ITT-examined Sambar. Therefore, the mycobacterial infection in blood samples of 314 deer samples was detected using these PCR methods. Duplex PCR and mnPCR showed an identical prevalence of 16.1% in Sambar and 8.2% in Sika and a significant difference in prevalence between these two deer species. M. bovis and M. tuberculosis were the species detected in feedlot Sambar and Sika. M. tuberculosis was found only and first in Sambar fed in central Taiwan. Sequence analysis revealed diverse genetic variations in M. bovis and M. tuberculosis associated with deer subspecies. CONCLUSION: Multiplex PCR methods were established, and M. bovis and M. tuberculosis were identified in feedlot deer in Taiwan. Sequence variations indicated diverse sources of both mycobacterial species."

We hypothesized that transcriptional signatures of host blood could be used to distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in African children who either were or were not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHODS: The study population comprised prospective cohorts of children who were undergoing evaluation for suspected tuberculosis in South Africa (655 children), Malawi (701 children), and Kenya (1599 children). Patients were assigned to groups according to whether the diagnosis was culture-confirmed tuberculosis, culture-negative tuberculosis, diseases other than tuberculosis, or latent tuberculosis infection. Diagnostic signatures distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases and from latent tuberculosis infection were identified from genomewide analysis of RNA expression in host blood. RESULTS: We identified a 51-transcript signature distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases in the South African and Malawian children (the discovery cohort). In the Kenyan children (the validation cohort), a risk score based on the signature for tuberculosis and for diseases other than tuberculosis showed a sensitivity of 82.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.6 to 94.3) and a specificity of 83.6% (95% CI, 74.6 to 92.7) for the diagnosis of culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Among patients with cultures negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis who were treated for tuberculosis (those with highly probable, probable, or possible cases of tuberculosis), the estimated sensitivity was 62.5 to 82.3%, 42.1 to 80.8%, and 35.3 to 79.6%, respectively, for different estimates of actual tuberculosis in the groups. In comparison, the sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for molecular detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in cases of culture-confirmed tuberculosis was 54.3% (95% CI, 37.1 to 68.6), and the sensitivity in highly probable, probable, or possible cases was an estimated 25.0 to 35.7%, 5.3 to 13.3%, and 0%, respectively; the specificity of the assay was 100%.

Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed pleural effusion at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from June 2012 to March 2013 were enrolled and divided into 3 groups of TPE, malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and non-tuberculous non-malignant pleural effusion (non-TPE non-MPE) according to the nature of pleural effusion. The level of sPD-L1 in pleural effusion and peripheral blood was analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Flow cytometry was used to detect the changes of immune cell subsets in pleural effusion. And the gene expressions of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) were detected in different effusions by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: A total of 77 newly diagnosed patients with pleural effusion were enrolled, 24 patients with TPE, 39 patients with MPE, 14 patients with non-TPE non-MPE. The level of sPD-L1 in TPE was higher than that in MPE and non-TPE non-MPE (4.2 (2.6-6.3), 1.4 (0.8-2.1), 1.8 (1.2-2.6) g/L, P &lt; 0.001). No significant difference existed in the levels of sPD-L1 in peripheral blood samples (P=0.811).

Forty-two cytokines were measured in cervicovaginal lavages from HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women. Frequencies of Th17 cells (CD3(+) CD4(+) IL-17a(+)) were evaluated in cervical cytobrushes and blood by flow cytometry. Women were screened for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis and herpes simplex virus 2 by PCR, and candidal infections and bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain. Women with bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), specifically chlamydia and gonorrhoea, had higher genital IL-17 concentrations than women with no STI, whereas women with candidal pseudohyphae/spores had lower IL-17 concentrations compared with women without candidal infections. Viral STIs (herpes simplex virus 2 and HIV) were not associated with significant changes in genital IL-17 concentrations. Genital IL-17 concentrations correlated strongly with other inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Although Th17 cells were depleted from blood during HIV infection, cervical Th17 cell frequencies were similar in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women. Cervical Th17 cell frequencies were also not associated with STIs or candida, although few women had a STI. These findings suggest that IL-17 production in the female genital tract is induced in response to bacterial but not viral STIs. Decreased IL-17 associated with candidal infections suggests that candida may actively suppress IL-17 production or women with dampened IL-17 responses may be more susceptible to candidal outgrowth."

In this study, we investigated the expression of cytolytic (perforin and granzyme A) and antimicrobial (granulysin) molecules at the single-cell level in cryopreserved lung tissue from patients with chronic, progressive tuberculosis disease. Quantification of protein-expressing cells was performed by in situ imaging, while mRNA levels in the infected tissue were analyzed by real-time PCR. Persistent inflammation, including excessive expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in CD68+ macrophages and significant infiltration of CD3+, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, was evident in tuberculosis lesions in all patients. However, despite the accumulation of CD3+ T cells, perforin- and granulysin-expressing CD3+ T cells were detected at two- to threefold-lower ratios in the tuberculosis lesions than in distal lung parenchyma and uninfected control lungs, respectively. This was evident at both the protein and mRNA levels. Moreover, perforin- and granulysin-expressing CD8+ T cells were scarce in individual granulomas within the tuberculosis lesions. In contrast, significant up-regulation of granzyme A-expressing CD3+ T cells was evident in the lesions from all patients. Confocal microscopy revealed coexpression of perforin and granulysin, primarily in CD8+ T cells; however, this expression was lower in the tuberculosis lesions. These findings suggest that symptomatic, chronic tuberculosis disease is associated with insufficient up-regulation of perforin and granulysin coexpression in CD8+ T cells at the local site of infection."

Sixty-five children with TB were selected for this study, which was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases Peoples Hospital of Laiwu City between December 2013 and December 2014. Sixty healthy children, selected in parallel, served as the control group. Real-time PCR was used to detect miR-31 expression in PBMCs. Serum levels of IL-6, TNF-, NF-B, and IFN- was detected by ELISA. ROC curve was employed to evaluate the diagnostic value of miR-31 in pediatric TB. Results show that expression of miRNA-31 in pediatric TB patients was significantly lower than that in normal children (0.48  0.15 vs 1.23  0.36, P < 0.05). By contrast, serum levels of the innate immune response cytokines, IL-6, TNF-, NF-B, and IFN-, were significantly higher in pediatric TB patients compared with normal children (P < 0.05). Furthermore, miRNA-31 expression was negatively correlated with serum levels of IL-6 (t = 69.91, P < 0.001), TNF- (t = 10.96, P < 0.001), NF-B (t = 39.94, P < 0.001), and IFN - (t = 37.94, P < 0.001). The cut-off threshold of miR-31 for pediatric TB diagnosis is 0.835 with a sensitivity of 98.5% and a specificity of 86.7%. Therefore, miR-31 has the potential to be a diagnostic marker in pediatric TB patients.  FUNPEC-RP."

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection increases the risk of anti-TB drug-induced hepatotoxicity, which may result in discontinuation of the therapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was (i) to estimate prevalence of HCV and HIV in a group of patients newly diagnosed with active TB in a public reference hospital in Porto Alegre and (ii) to compare demographic, behavioural, and clinical characteristics of patients in relation to their HCV infection status. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients with TB were tested for anti-HCV antibody, HCV RNA, and anti-HIV1/2 antibody markers. HCV RNA from real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive samples was submitted to reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The 5' non-coding region of the HCV genome was sequenced, and genotypes of HCV isolates were determined. FINDINGS: Anti-HCV antibody, HCV RNA, and anti-HIV antibodies were detected in 27 [20%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 13-26%], 17 (12%; 95% CI, 7-18%), and 34 (25%; 95% CI, 17-32%) patients, respectively. HCV isolates belonged to genotypes 1 (n = 12) and 3 (n = 4). Some characteristics were significantly more frequent in patients infected with HCV. Among them, non-white individuals, alcoholics, users of illicit drugs, imprisoned individuals, and those with history of previous TB episode were more commonly infected with HCV (p < 0.05). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: HCV screening, including detection of anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA, will be important to improving the management of co-infected patients, given their increased risk of developing TB treatment-related hepatotoxicity."

To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the IGRA, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of culture, radiologic imaging, polymerase chain reaction testing, fine needle aspiration, and excisional biopsy. RESULT: Of the 271 adult patients with suspected TB lymphadenitis, 42 were diagnosed with the disease. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the IGRA were 78.8% and 95.5%, respectively. When the cutoff value of IFN- was set to 0.26 IU/mL, it met the inclusion criteria for suspicious TB lymphadenitis, with sensitivity and specificity of 83.3% and 95.1%, respectively.

Numerous cytokines and regulator factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Additional cytokines and chemokines associated with M. tuberculosis infection may improve the performance of IFN- release assays. We developed a real-time RT-PCR TaqMan assay for targeting levels of eight human targets [IFN-, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and evaluated the assay with three different study groups. Results showed that the sensitivity of TNF-, IL-2R, and CXCL10 in the active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group was 96.43%, 96.43%, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity of IL-2R and CXCL10 in the latent tuberculosis infection group was 86.36% and 81.82%, respectively. Statistical results showed that TNF- and CXCL9 were the best individual markers for differentiating between the PTB, LTBI, and non-TB groups. For optimal sensitivity and differentiation of M. tuberculosis infection status, the simultaneous detection of multiple targets was attempted. The combination of IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2R, and the combination of TNF-, IL-2R, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed the best performance for detecting active PTB (both 100% positivity) and LTBI (86.36% and 81.82% positivity, respectively). These results imply that the combination of suitable markers is useful in efficiently diagnosing TB and differentiating M. tuberculosis infection status."

For 63 elephants and 149 elephant handlers, TB seroprevalence was estimated at 20.4% and 24.8%, respectively. From 151 trunkwash samples, 24 acid-fast isolates were obtained, 23 of which were identified by hsp65-based sequencing as non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific PCR was positive in the trunk-wash samples from three elephants which were also seropositive. Conversely, the trunk wash from seven seropositive elephants were PCR negative. Hence, there was evidence of active and latent TB in the elephants and the high seroprevalence in the elephants and their handlers suggests frequent, close contact, two-way transmission between animals and humans within confined workplaces."

We extracted DNA using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and performed real-time assay using Rotor-Gene Q machine from Corbett Research, Australia for specific amplification of IS6110 sequence of mycobacterial genome. The RT-PCR result was also compared with bacterial culture and acid-fast bacillus staining. RT-PCR assay showed positivity in 52 cases and negative in 456 cases. Corresponding positive results in culture and acid-fast bacillus staining methods were 49 cases and 24 cases respectively.

The overall positive and negative predictive values were 88.46% and 99.34% respectively. RT-PCR is a useful diagnostic tool for rapid and sensitive detection of mycobacteria in different clinical samples. The easy processing, fast reporting and relative lack of contamination issues make it worthy as a possible replacement to time consuming culture techniques. Moreover, it has added advantage of quantification of mycobacterial DNA, hence bacterial load."

Currently available various laboratory investigations have not only limited ability to discriminate between MAC infection and tuberculosis but are also laborious and time consuming. The aim of this study was, therefore, to design a molecular-based strategy for specific detection of MAC and its differentiation from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) isolated from the blood specimens of HIV patients. A simple PCR was developed based on the amplification of 120-bp katG-N gene corresponding to the first 40 amino acids of N-terminal catalase-peroxidase (KatG) protein of Mycobacterium avium that shows only ~13% sequence homology by clustal W alignment to N-terminal region of M. tb KatG protein. This assay allowed the accurate and rapid detection of MAC bacteremia, distinguishing it from M. tb in a single PCR reaction without any need for sequencing or hybridization protocol to be performed thereafter. This study produced enough evidence that a significant proportion of Indian HIV patients have disseminated MAC bacteremia, suggesting the utility of M. avium katG-N gene PCR for early detection of MAC disease in HIV patients."

METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with MTB-HAg to generate MTB-HAg-activated T cells (MTBAT) and expanded in the neutral condition or Th2 polarizing condition. After restimulation for 6 hours with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 10 ng/mL), ionomycin (500 ng/mL) and monensin (2.5 mol/L), intracellular cytokines (IFN-, IL-4) of T cells and T cells among MTBAT were detected by four-color fluorescence mAb staining combined with flow cytometry. The highly purified T cells and CD4 T cells were sorted by flow cytometer from MTBAT that were cultured in neutral and Th2 polarizing conditions for 28 days. The expressions of T-bet and GATA-3 mRNA in purified T cells and CD4 T cells were determined by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) technique. RESULTS: T cells among MTBAT cultured in the neutral or Th2 polarizing condition predominantly produced IFN-, whereas the percentage of IFN- T cells significantly decreased in the Th2 polarizing condition as the culture time went by. Compared with the neutral condition, Th0 type (IFN- IL-4) T cells significantly increased, and Th2 type (IFN- IL-4) T cells also significantly increased in the Th2 polarizing condition. RT-PCR showed that mRNA expression of T-bet was still at a high level in T cells that were expanded in the Th2 polarizing condition, but at a low level in Th2 polarized CD4 T cells. Moreover, the mRNA expressions of GATA-3 in both Th2 polarized T cells and CD4T cells were up-regulated. CONCLUSION: In the Th2 polarizing condition, the majority of T cells in MTBAT still remained Th1 profile, whereas the portion of T cells differentiated into Th0 type cells. Both transcription factor T-bet and GATA-3 failed to display a fully cross-regulation function in Th2 polarized T cells."

Tuberculous pericarditis is detected clinically either in the effusive stage by nonspecific systemic syndrome or after the development of constrictive pericarditis. The short-course treatment of tuberculous pericarditis should consist of three-drug regimen, such as INH, RFP, PZA, SM, EB. The use of prednisolone is controversial.

Inhibiting these suppressive signals enhances T cell function to control persistent infection; yet, the underlying signals and mechanisms that program immunosuppressive cell fates and functions are not well understood. Herein, we use lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection (LCMV) to demonstrate that the induction and functional programming of immunosuppressive dendritic cells (DCs) during viral persistence are separable mechanisms programmed by factors primarily considered pro-inflammatory. IFN first induces the de novo development of naive monocytes into DCs with immunosuppressive potential. Type I interferon (IFN-I) then directly targets these newly generated DCs to program their potent T cell immunosuppressive functions while simultaneously inhibiting conventional DCs with T cell stimulating capacity. These mechanisms of monocyte conversion are constant throughout persistent infection, establishing a system to continuously interpret and shape the immunologic environment. MyD88 signaling was required for the differentiation of suppressive DCs, whereas inhibition of stimulatory DCs was dependent on MAVS signaling, demonstrating a bifurcation in the pathogen recognition pathways that promote distinct elements of IFN-I mediated immunosuppression. Further, a similar suppressive DC origin and differentiation was also observed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, HIV infection and cancer. Ultimately, targeting the underlying mechanisms that induce immunosuppression could simultaneously prevent multiple suppressive signals to further restore T cell function and control persistent infections."

We investigated 25 patients diagnosed with mycobacterial infections of the skin in Hanyang University Hospital between 2001 and 2011. Skin biopsy specimens were re-evaluated by various histopathological criteria and molecular studies. To identify the mycobacteria, we performed staining for acid-fast bacilli and also completed polymerase chain reaction analysis. The non-tuberculous mycobacterium species were identified by genetic sequencing of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Immunocompromised status was more frequent in non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections than in tuberculosis (p = 0.017) while disease duration was longer in tuberculosis (p = 0.026). Microscopically, neutrophil infiltration, interstitial granuloma, small vessel proliferation and increased numbers of bacilli were found to be associated with non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections (all p < 0.05). In contrast, giant cells, plasma cells, tuberculoid granulomas and necrosis were associated with tuberculosis (all p < 0.05). There were no species-specific histopathological findings in non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections. The significant histopathological differences between cutaneous tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections are helpful in considering differential diagnoses. In addition, molecular techniques together with clinico-pathological findings may assist in making accurate diagnoses of cutaneous non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections."

PBMCs from 3 donors with negative results were then cocultured with Ag85A mRNA-transfected autologous PBMCs for 1 week to achieve in vitro primary induction of Ag85A-specific T cells. After restimulation with freshly prepared stimulator cells, a small but significant number of IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells was detected. The induction of IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells by overnight coculture was completely abolished by anti-class II or anti-interleukin-12 antibodies, whereas it was partially inhibited by anti-class I antibody.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from January 2001 to December 2010. METHODOLOGY: Different clinical specimens received for Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR were dealt during the study period. Contaminated samples like sputum were processed by the standard N-acetyl L-cysteine (NALC)-NaOH method. PCR protocols were followed as per manufacturer's manual. PCR was performed using a Thermal Cycler (Master Cycler, Eppendorf, Germany): an initial denaturation step at 94C for 3 minutes was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94C for 30 seconds, annealing at 60C for 30 seconds and extension at 72C for 30 seconds and a final extension at 72C for 7 minutes. The products were held at 4C and later run on 1% agarose gel, stained with Ethidium bromide and visualized in ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator. RESULTS: Out of a total 4620 samples for PCR, 299 were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6.5%). The percentage of samples from male patients were 63.2%. The mean age of patients was 38+11.5 years. Blood was the most frequent specimen received for PCR (46.66%), followed by body fluids (18.41%) and CSF (10.64%). Yield for different clinical samples was 63/471 for sputum (13.4%), 3/29 for endobronchial washings (10.3%), 59/851 for body fluids (6.9%) and 24/400 for urine (6%). Positive yield from blood was the lowest (101/2156, 4.7%). CONCLUSION: PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis.

However, diagnosis and treatment advances are hindered by lack of understanding of LNTB biology. To identify host response, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected lymph nodes from LNTB patients were studied by means of transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics analyses. The selected targets obtained by comparative analyses were validated by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. This approach provided expression data for 8,728 transcripts and 102 proteins, differentially regulated in the infected human lymph node. Enhanced inflammation with upregulation of T-helper1-related genes, combined with marked dysregulation of matrix metalloproteinases, indicates tissue damage due to high immunoactivity at infected niche. This expression signature was accompanied by significant upregulation of an immunoregulatory gene, leukotriene A4 hydrolase, at both transcript and protein levels. Comparative transcriptional analyses revealed LNTB-specific perturbations. In contrast to pulmonary TB-associated increase in lipid metabolism, genes involved in fatty-acid metabolism were found to be downregulated in LNTB suggesting differential lipid metabolic signature. This study investigates the tissue molecular signature of LNTB patients for the first time and presents findings that indicate the possible mechanism of disease pathology through dysregulation of inflammatory and tissue-repair processes."

An HIV-infected patient with high fever, anemia, high alkaline phosphatase, cystic lung lesions, hepatitis B virus infection and Kaposi's sarcoma was referred to our hospital. PCR of the blood revealed Mycobacterium avium bacteremia and the time to blood culture positivity was 8 days. The HIV-1 RNA copy number in the plasma was more than ten million copies/ml and the CD4-positive T cell count was 21 cells/L. Although the high fever resolved five days after therapy for Mycobacterium avium was started, the fever recurred just before starting anti-retroviral therapy (ART) including dolutegravir. The patient experienced repeated but self-limiting bouts of severe inflammation. Mycobacteremia was intermittently detected up to 79 days, suggesting that the recurrent episodes of inflammation were due to the intermittent dissemination of mycobacteria, and that persistent treatment is needed. Five months after the beginning of ART, the HIV-1 RNA copy number in the plasma was still 28,000 copies/ml. An HIV drug-resistance test revealed sensitivity to all anti-retroviral drugs. Eleven months after the initiation of ART, the HIV RNA copy number in the plasma decreased to 45 copies/mL and the CD4-positive T cell count recovered to 205 cells/L. Our case also suggests that dolutegravir can be effective in cases with prolonged high levels of HIV RNA.

However, very limited information is available on the circulation of pathogens affecting the productivity and health of this species. To produce baseline data on the circulation of infectious pathogens in rusa deer under production, a serological survey and/or direct pathogen detection for six selected infectious diseases was undertaken in 2007 in a sample of 53% of the herds reared in semi-free-ranging conditions in hunting estates. Seropositive results were recorded for Johne's disease with an indirect ELISA test (1.7%, n = 351), heartwater with an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) (95.5%, n = 178) and leptospirosis with a Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) (25.9%, n = 363). Significant associations were found between seroprevalence to some of the leptospiral serogroups detected (Tarassovi, Pomona, Sejroe and Mini) and age of the animals, animal density or location of the estates (being more prevalent in hotter and more humid areas). In addition, Mycobacterium bovis and M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis were confirmed in two deer carcasses by culture and PCR, respectively. No antibodies against Brucella spp. nor Rift Valley Fever virus were detected with the use of respective indirect ELISA's. The results obtained suggest that the population of rusa deer from Mauritius is exposed to a wide range of pathogens which may affect their productivity. In addition, the results highlight the potential public health risks incurred by deer industry workers and consumers. This survey fills an important gap in knowledge regarding the health of tropical deer meat in Mauritius and justifies the need to implement more regular surveys of selected pathogens in the deer population."

A high risk of tuberculosis (TB) has been shown in early stages of the HIV disease, even in the presence of normal CD4(+) cell counts. Moreover, the factors that determine protective immunity vs. susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis cannot be fully explained by simple changes in IFN levels or a shift from Th1 to Th2 cytokines. This work investigated the relationship between cytokine expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and susceptibility to M. tuberculosis in 10 HIV+ women who went onto develop TB. RNA transcripts for IL-4, IL-42, IL-10, IL-12(p35), IL-13, IL-17A, IFN and TNF were measured by real-time quantitative PCR in unstimulated or TB peptide antigen-stimulated PBMCs from 10 HIV+ women with positive tuberculin skin tests (TST) and compared with HIV-seropositive and seronegative women without previous TB and negative TST. Stimulated PBMC cultures showed significantly lower expression of IL-12p35 (p=0.004) and IL-10 (p=0.026) in the HIV+TB+ group 6-12months before onset of TB compared to HIV+TB- women. Unstimulated PBMC from HIV+TB+ women also had lower expression of Th2 cytokines [IL-4 (p=0.056) and IL-13 (p=0.050)] compared to HIV+TB- women. These results suggest that lower IL-12 production by PBMC in response to TB antigens and lower levels of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines by PBMC correlate with future development of TB in HIV-infected women and may be responsible for their increased susceptibility."

Etiology was defined by blood culture, Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen detection, sputum mycobacterial culture and Xpert MTB/RIF, and nasopharyngeal aspirate multiplex PCR.Measurements and Main Results: In 459 patients (285 [62.1%] males; median age, 34.7 [interquartile range, 29.4-41.9] yr), 30-day mortality was 14.6% (64/439) and associated with male sex (adjusted odds ratio, 2.60 [95% confidence interval, 1.17-5.78]), symptom duration greater than 7 days (2.78 [1.40-5.54]), tachycardia (2.99 [1.48-6.06]), hypoxemia (4.40 [2.03-9.51]), and inability to stand (3.59 [1.72-7.50]). HIV was common (355/453; 78.4%), frequently newly diagnosed (124/355; 34.9%), but not associated with mortality. S. pneumoniae (98/458; 21.4%) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (75/326; 23.0%) were the most frequently identified pathogens. Viral infection occurred in 32.6% (148/454) with influenza (40/454; 8.8%) most common. Bacterial-viral coinfection occurred in 9.1% (28/307). Detection of M. tuberculosis was associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.44 [1.19-5.01]).Conclusions: In the antiretroviral therapy era, CAP in Malawi remains predominantly HIV associated, with a large proportion attributable to potentially vaccine-preventable pathogens. Strategies to increase early detection and treatment of tuberculosis and improve supportive care, in particular the correction of hypoxemia, should be evaluated in clinical trials to address CAP-associated mortality."

The diagnosis of intestinal TB should be based on careful clinical evaluation, such as extra-intestinal signs, colonoscopic and histologic evaluation. Newer techniques such as PCR method or test for the diagnosis of latent TB (Interferon-gamma assay) may be helpful. In addition, a high index of suspicion must be kept in mind to ensure a timely diagnosis. Herein, IBD Study Group of the KASID proposes a diagnostic guideline based on currently available evidence and experience, especially those of Korea. We also propose the test which may be helpful to establish the proper diagnosis of intestinal TB."

We have improved our previously reported PCR based on the amplification of a fragment of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex-specific insertion element IS6110 with respect to both problems. False-positive reactions caused by amplicon contamination were prevented by the use of uracil-N-glycosylase and dUTP instead of dTTP. We selected a new set of primers outside the region spanned by the formerly used primers to avoid false-positive reactions caused by dTTP-containing amplicons still present in the laboratory. With this new primer set, 16 copies of the IS6110 insertion element, the equivalent of two bacteria, could be amplified 10(10) times in 40 cycles, resulting in a mean efficiency of 77% per cycle. To detect the presence of inhibitors of the Taq polymerase, which may cause false-negative reactions, part of each sample was spiked with M. tuberculosis DNA. The DNA purification method using guanidinium thiocyanate and diatoms effectively removed most or all inhibitors of the PCR. However, this was not suitable for blood samples, for which we developed a proteinase K treatment followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. This method permitted detection of 20 M. tuberculosis bacteria per ml of whole blood. Various laboratory procedures were introduced to reduce failure or inhibition of PCR and avoid DNA cross contamination. We have tested 218 different clinical specimens obtained from patients suspected of having tuberculosis. The samples included sputum (n=145), tissue biopsy samples (n=25), cerebrospinal fluid (n=15), blood (n=14), pleural fluid (n=9), feces, (n=7), fluid from fistulae (n=2), and pus from a wound (n=1). The results obtained by PCR were consistent with those obtained with culture, which is the ""gold standard."" We demonstrate that PCR is a useful technique for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis at various sites."

The aim was to find out clinical, endoscopic, and histological predictor features for differentiation between CD and intestinal tuberculosis. METHODS: We recruited 106 patients, 53 each with CD and intestinal tuberculosis, in this study. The clinical, histological, and endoscopic features were subjected to univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. On the basis of regression coefficients of the final multivariate logistic model, a score to discriminate between CD and intestinal tuberculosis was devised. For the validation of the score, the same model was tested on 20 new patients, each with CD and intestinal tuberculosis. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, although longer duration of disease, chronic diarrhea, blood in stool, perianal disease, extra-intestinal manifestations, involvement of left colon, skip lesions, aphthous ulcers, cobblestoning, longitudinal ulcers, focally enhanced colitis, and microgranulomas were significantly more common in CD, partial intestinal obstruction, constipation, presence of nodular lesions, higher number, and larger granulomas were significantly more common in intestinal tuberculosis. On multivariate analysis, blood in stool (odds ratio (OR) 0.1 (confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.5)), weight loss (OR 9.8 (CI 2.2-43.9)), histologically focally enhanced colitis (OR 0.1 (CI 0.03-0.5)), and involvement of sigmoid colon (OR 0.07(0.01-0.3)) were independent predictors of intestinal tuberculosis. On the basis of regression coefficients of the final multivariate logistic model, a score that varied from 0.3 to 9.3 was devised. Higher score predicted more likelihood of intestinal tuberculosis. Once the cutoff was set at 5.1, then the sensitivity, specificity, and ability to correctly classify the two diseases were 83.0, 79.2, and 81.1%, respectively. Area under the curve for receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) to assess the ability of these features to discriminate between CD and intestinal tuberculosis was 0.9089. The area under ROC in the validation data set was 89.2% (95% CI 0.79-0.99). With a similar cutoff score of 5.1, sensitivity and specificity in the validation model were 90% (95% CI 66.9-98.2) and 60% (95% CI 36.4-80.0), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood in stool, weight loss, focally enhanced colitis, and involvement of the sigmoid colon were the most important features in differentiating CD from intestinal tuberculosis."

AIMS: To evaluate the role of PCR in the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in necrotising non-granulomatous lymphadenitis in Thai patients using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. METHODS: 35 patient samples showing necrotising non-granulomatous lymphadenitis were subjected to PCR for detection of the IS6110 sequence of M tuberculosis. For comparison, sections were visually assessed for acid-fast bacilli using the Ziehl-Neelsen stain. RESULTS: Among 35 cases of necrotising non-granulomatous lymphadenitis, a conclusive diagnosis could be reached in 23 cases: 15 cases of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, 6 of tuberculosis and 2 of systemic lupus erythematosus. Of the 6 cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis, 4 (66.6%) were detected by PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples. PCR was positive in 6/12 of the remaining cases (50%) in which a definitive diagnosis could not be reached by other methods. CONCLUSION: Using PCR, a significant percentage (28%) of cases of necrotising non-granulomatous lymphadenitis in this study could be attributed to M tuberculosis. PCR for identification of the organism can be extremely helpful in confirming a diagnosis of tuberculosis when Ziehl-Neelsen staining is negative."

Distinguishing a true co-infection from cross reactivity is often challenging as the diagnosis is mostly dependent on serological testing. Patient concerns: A 77-year-old male presented with worsening dyspnea, cough with yellow sputum, diarrhea and fever of 2-days duration. Patient had history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on home oxygen, bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis (on methotrexate and leflunomide), treated pulmonary tuberculosis and 30-pack-year smoking. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial changes with left lower lobe infiltrate. On day 5, his urine antigen for L pneumophila serogroup 1 was reported positive. The following day his serum M pneumoniae IgM antibody titers were reported elevated at 6647 U/mL. Patient was started on antibiotics and placed on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with possible Legionella and Mycoplasma co-infection. Outcomes: Sputum Mycoplasma polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serum cold agglutinins were obtained on day 6 and later reported negative. He was treated with azithromycin for 10 days with clinical improvement. Lessons: Serological testing alone is an indirect measure with poor sensitivity and specificity and has its own limitations. Urine antigen detection confirms L pneumophila serogroup 1 infection in a patient with suggestive symptoms. However, diagnosis of M pneumonia should be based on combination of tests including serology and PCR to confirm true co-infection.  2018 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The results showed that Rv3117 was able to evoke specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Consistent with the results from the RD1-encoded antigens, culture filtrate protein 10 kDa (CFP-10) and early secreted antigenic target 6 kDa (ESAT-6), the immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA antibody responses to Rv3117 were able to statistically distinguish between the 65 patients with active pulmonary TB and the 59 healthy controls (P<0.01, respectively). In addition, higher levels of Rv3117specific interferon- (IFN-) were observed in immunized C57BL/6 mice than in the negative control mice (P<0.05). Furthermore, high titers of total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were present in the sera from immunized mice, even six weeks subsequent to the immunization. In conclusion, the present results suggested that Rv3117 may be used as a candidate for the development of TB immunodiagnostics and vaccine design."

Objective: To identify the correct criteria for the diagnosis. Setting: National Spinal Injuries Centre, UK. Methods: (1) Medical and radiological records of 10 patients diagnosed as vertebral osteomyelitis and treated elsewhere but later admitted to the NSIC were reviewed retrospectively. (2) Medical literature on vertebral osteomyelitis were reviewed. Results: (1) Case review: Before the study, four of the 10 patients TVO had been diagnosed based on positive bacteriology. Of the other six, the diagnosis of PVO had been made in one based on positive blood culture of staphylococcus while in another without any positive result of bacteriology. The diagnosis had been uncertain in four because of negative results of both bacteriology and histology on both tuberculous and pyogenic infection. The author made the diagnosis of TVO in all 10 cases based on clinical manifestations and plain radiographs. Highly raised ESR with moderate rise of or normal WBC in eight cases supported TVO. Computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging did not contribute to the differential diagnosis. Laminectomy in five patients led to some clinical improvement. The five patients without surgery deteriorated. Two of them died. (2) Literature review: A total of 188 articles were reviewed. The crucial role of plain radiographs in the diagnosis of TVO and the high incidence of false-negative of tuberculosis in both bacteriological and histological tests were neglected in most articles. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was more reliable in diagnosing tuberculosis. Conclusion: Clinical manifestations, discrepancy between ESR and WBC, plain radiographs and PCR are keys to a correct diagnosis of TVO.  2005 International Spinal Cord Society. All rights reserved."

Granulomas with a core containing giant cells, human CD68(+) macrophages, and high bacilli numbers surrounded by a layer of CD3(+) T cells and a fibrotic response encapsulating the lesions were observed in livers and lungs from bacillus Calmette-Gurin-infected humanized mice but not in nonhumanized infected controls. Paradoxically, humanized mice contained higher mycobacterial numbers in organs than nonhumanized controls. The enhancement of bacterial load was mediated by human CD4(+) cells and associated to an increased expression of Programmed Death-1 protein and CD57 on T cells, molecules associated with inhibition and senescence. The lesions from mice depleted of CD4(+) cells were scarcer, minimal, and irregular compared with those from mice depleted of CD8(+) cells or nondepleted controls.

Rifampicin is a strong CYP enzyme inducer while isoniazid is a potent CYP inhibitor. The objective of the study was to find the net effect of one month ATT on CYP2C9 enzyme and to correlate it with respect to the CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty eight newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients were included in the study based on the inclusion-exclusion criteria. Before commencing ATT, they were given a single dose of phenytoin 300 mg as a probe drug for CYP2C9. Blood sample was collected after three hours to carry out CYP2C9 genotyping by PCR-RFLP method. Phenotyping for CYP2C9 enzyme was done by measuring the ratio of phenytoin and its metabolite p-HPPH (para hydroxy phenyl hydantoin) by reverse phase HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) method before and after one month of ATT. RESULTS: In the CYP2C9*1*1 genotype, the mean plasma concentrations of phenytoin before and after one month of ATT were 5.2  0.3 g/ml and 3.5  0.4 g/ml respectively, a reduction by 33% showing significant induction (P < 0.001). There was also significant decrease in the metabolic ratio after one month of ATT from 23.2  4.8 to 10.1  1.9 (P < 0.001).

Immune regulatory mechanisms may limit this immunopathology, and suppressed cellular immune responses in patients with TB suggest the presence of regulatory activity. CD4+CD25(high) regulatory T cells mediate suppressed cellular immunity in several chronic infections but have not been described in TB. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether regulatory T cells are increased in patients with TB and whether they suppress cellular immune responses. METHODS: We compared the frequency of circulating regulatory T cells in 27 untreated patients with TB and 23 healthy control subjects using two specific markers: cell-surface CD25 expression and FoxP3 mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We detected a threefold increase in the frequency of CD4 + CD25(high) T cells (p < 0.001) and a 2.2-fold increase in FoxP3 expression (p = 0.006) in patients with TB, and there was a positive correlation between these markers (r = 0.58, p < 0.001). Increased expression of interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta1 mRNA was also detected in patients with TB but did not correlate with regulatory T-cell markers. Ex vivo depletion of CD4 + CD25(high) cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in increased numbers of M. tuberculosis antigen-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells in seven of eight patients with TB (p = 0.005). Finally, FoxP3 expression was increased 2.3-fold in patients with extrapulmonary TB compared with patients with purely pulmonary TB (p = 0.01) and was amplified 2.6-fold at disease sites relative to blood (p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: Regulatory T cells are expanded in patients with TB and may contribute to suppression of Th1-type immune responses."

The aim of this study was to determine alteration patterns of SDC1 and HPA and their potential roles in evaluating disease activity and differentiating CD from intestinal tuberculosis (ITB). METHODS: Tissue and serum specimens were obtained from 89 patients, including 15 patients with functional bowel disorders, 18 active patients with ITB, and 56 patients with CD (remission = 19, active = 37). Basic clinical data were collected and routine blood tests were analyzed. SDC1 and HPA were measured by immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and western blot. Colonic epithelial cells were incubated with recombinant HPA, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and mycobacterium tuberculosis culture filtrate protein to detect the alterations of SDC1 and HPA. RESULTS: In the CD group, SDC1 was significantly decreased in mucosa and increased in serum, whereas HPA level in both were elevated. Such alterations were associated with clinicopathological features representing disease activity and injury severity and were not available in functional bowel disorder and ITB groups. Recombinant HPA incubation increased soluble SDC1 in culture supernatants (P = 2  10(-4)), and low-dose TNF- effectively enhanced HPA's activity (P = 3  10(-6)). Exogenous TNF- destroyed cellular SDC1 and raised HPA expressions dose dependently, whereas mycobacterium tuberculosis culture filtrate protein showed no effects. CONCLUSIONS: Unique alterations of SDC1 and HPA are shown in both patients with CD and in vitro model. The results indicate SDC1 and HPA are potential markers for CD in evaluating its disease activity and differentiating it from ITB."

A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a diffuse nodular shadow in the upper lung. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, based on a positive T-SPOT.TB test result of peripheral blood and a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in gastric aspirates. M.tuberculosis was subsequently isolated from the gastric aspirate specimen. After 2 months of treatment with antituberculous medication, the patient developed a low grade fever and left-sided chest pain. A CT scan revealed a left pleural effusion and a right subphrenic abscess. Tuber- culous pleurisy with paradoxical response was diagnosed on the basis of an increased lymphocyte count and increased adenosine deaminase activity in the pleural fluid exudate. A percutaneous ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the sub- phrenic abscess was performed. Histological analysis revealed epithelioid cell granulomas with necrosis and PCR for M. tuberculosis using puncture needle washing fluid returned positive results. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of subphrenic abscess with paradoxical response, caused by M. tuberculosis, was made. Subphrenic abscess caused by M. tuberculosis is an important consideration during antituber- culous therapy."

Elk were examined post-mortem, and tissue and fecal samples were submitted for radiometric mycobacterial culture. Acid-fast isolates were identified by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that discriminates among members of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Histopathologic evaluations were completed, and animals were tested for antibodies using a Johne's enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and agar gel immunodiffusion. In addition, 104 fecal samples from tule elk remaining in the herd were collected from the ground and submitted for radiometric mycobacterial culture. No gross lesions were detected in any of the hunter-killed animals. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) was cultured once from ileocecal tissue of one adult elk and was determined to be a strain (A18) found commonly in infected cattle. One or more isolates of Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (MAA) were isolated from tissues of five additional adult elk. Gastrointestinal tract and lymph node tissues from 17 of the 37 elk (46%) examined had histopathologic lesions commonly seen with mycobacterial infection; however, acid-fast bacteria were not observed. All MAC infections were detected from adult elk (P = 0.023). In adult elk, a statistically significant association was found between MAA infection and ELISA sample-to-positive ratio (S/P) > or = 0.25 (P=0.021); four of five MAA culture-positive elk tested positive by ELISA. Sensitivity and specificity of ELISA S/P > or = 0.25 for detection of MAA in adult elk were 50% and 93%, respectively. No significant associations were found between MAC infection and sex or histopathologic lesions. Bacteriologic culture confirmed infection with MAP and MAA in this asymptomatic tule elk herd. The Johne's ELISA was useful in signaling mycobacterial infection on a population basis but could not discriminate between MAA and MAP antibodies. The multiplex PCR was useful in discriminating among the closely related species belonging to MAC."

OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of positive induced sputum cultures among probable childhood tuberculosis (TB) cases, to describe the laboratory and radiological features of childhood TB in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and to determine the prevalence of HIV infection in these patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. METHOD: Seven hundred and fifty children with suspected TB were evaluated clinically, by chest radiography and by tuberculin test (Mantoux). Probable cases underwent sputum induction or lymph node biopsy, HIV testing and RNA-PCR tests. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The Mantoux test was positive in 55/121 (45%) of the patients; low sensitivity to Mantoux was associated with HIV infection (P = 0.000). Induced sputum yielded 12/101 (12%) positive smears of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 30/101 (30%) positive cultures. Six of the eight lymph node biopsies were culture-positive, and the histology of seven samples was supportive of TB. Most of the children with probable and confirmed TB presented with similar signs, symptoms and chest radiography patterns, irrespective of HIV status. Elevated ESR had no significant role in the diagnosis of TB in children and even more so in the presence of HIV infection. The HIV infection rate was high among children with TB (49%)."

In this study, the sensitivity of the gamma-interferon (IFN-) assay using an antigen cocktail containing early secretory antigenic target-6kDa (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) peptides for stimulation was determined and compared with those obtained in single intradermal tuberculin (SIT) and single intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin (SICCT) tests and IFN- assay using purified protein derivative (PPD) in three different flocks infected with M. caprae under different epidemiological conditions. Correlation between specific IFN- production and severity of lesions was also evaluated. Sensitivities of the diagnostic tests varied greatly in the three flocks studied, with higher values in those where higher lesion scores were observed. The results show that IFN- assay applied in goats using PPD or the ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides cocktail for stimulation yielded similar sensitivity values. A significant yet weak positive correlation between specific IFN- production and lesion scores was detected after the stimulation with PPDs (p=0.004) whereas when the blood samples were stimulated with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides, the correlation was not significant (p>0.05). Therefore, specific-IFN- production after the stimulation with PPDs or ESAT-6/CFP-10 was not an accurate indicator of lesion severity in naturally tuberculosis infected goats with M. caprae."

The validity of combined FNA  Tb-PCR and CBC in the diagnosis of diseases requiring deWnitive treatment was evaluated. Final diagnoses were self-limiting disease in 110 (69.6%), malignancy in 19 (12.0%), and tuberculosis in 26 (16.5%). Sensitivity of FNA  Tb-PCR was 66.7% and of added CBC proWle was 97.9%. Patients with neutropenia or lymphocytosis were found to have a higher chance of spontaneous recovery than patients with a normal WBC proWle. FNA and Tb-PCR were found to be important in patients aged more than 20. The results indicate that FNA, Tb-PCR, and CBC are basic and essential in initial work-up for cervical lymphadenopathy. In particular, CBC was found to aid in detecting critical diseases and predicting the likelihood of open biopsy in patients with negative FNA and Tb-PCR.

Natural killer (NK) cells mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), release immunostimulatory cytokines and thus function as potent anti-tumour effector cells. However, tumour cells developed mechanisms to escape from an effective immune response. So highly immunogenic substances, like the 38 kDa-preparation of M. tuberculosis, PstS-1, are explored for their potential to enhance cancer-targeted immune responses. In this study we examined the modulation of different NK cell functions by accessory monocytes and PstS-1. We focussed on NK cell activation as well as natural and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity directed against epidermal-growth-factor-receptor (EGFR)-positive ovarian cancer cell lines. METHODS: Activation, cytokine release and cytotoxicity of NK cells stimulated by monocytes and PstS-1 were determined by FACS-analysis, ELISA, Bioplex assay and quantitative polymerase-chain reaction (qPCR). Transwell assays were used to discriminate cell-cell contact-dependent from contact-independent mechanisms. Five ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, IGROV-1, OVCAR-3, OVCAR-4 and SKOV-3) with different EGFR-expression were used as target cells for natural and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays. Cetuximab (anti-EGFR-antibody) was used for ADCC studies. RESULTS: Our data show that monocytes effectively enhance activation as well natural and antibody-dependent cytolytic activity of NK cells. PstS-1 directly stimulated monocytes and further activated monocyte-NK-co-cultures. However, PstS-1 did not directly influence purified NK cells and did also not affect natural and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity directed against EGFR-positive ovarian cancer cells, even in presence of monocytes. Direct cell-cell contact between NK cells and monocytes was required for NK activation, while released cytokines seemed to play a minor role. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that monocytes enhance natural and antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity of NK cells in a cell-cell contact dependent manner. The TLR-agonist PstS-1 provides additional monocyte activation and induces NK activation markers, while NK cytotoxicity remains unaffected. We conclude that monocytes provide accessory function for ADCC exerted by NK during antibody-based cancer immunotherapy directed against EGFR-positive ovarian cancer cells."

We hypothesized that microglial-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have a key role in driving such damage. Analysis of all of the MMPs demonstrated that conditioned medium from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected human monocytes (CoMTb) stimulated greater MMP-1, -3, and -9 gene expression in human microglial cells than direct infection. In patients with CNS TB, MMP-1/-3 immunoreactivity was demonstrated in the center of brain granulomas. Concurrently, CoMTb decreased expression of the inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, -3, and -4. MMP-1/-3 secretion was significantly inhibited by dexamethasone, which reduces mortality in CNS TB. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis of CoMTb showed that TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are necessary but not sufficient for upregulating MMP-1 secretion and act synergistically to drive MMP-3 secretion. Chemical inhibition and promoter-reporter analyses showed that NF-kappaB and AP-1 c-Jun/FosB heterodimers regulate CoMTb-induced MMP-1/-3 secretion. Furthermore, NF-kappaB p65 and AP-1 c-Jun subunits were upregulated in biopsy granulomas from patients with cerebral TB. In summary, functionally unopposed, network-dependent microglial MMP-1/-3 gene expression and secretion regulated by NF-kappaB and AP-1 subunits were demonstrated in vitro and, for the first time, in CNS TB patients. Dexamethasone suppression of MMP-1/-3 gene expression provides a novel mechanism explaining the benefit of steroid therapy in these patients."

The SNP detection of 1513A>C and -762T>C was performed using PCR-RFLP, and the levels of serum IgG responses to MTB in all subjects were determined. RESULTS: AC and CC of 1513A>C and TC and CC of -762T>C had higher frequencies in case group than in control group. TB patients carrying TC and CC of -762T>C had higher positive rate of IgG responses to MTB than those carrying TT. Additionally, patients carrying TC and CC of -762T>C had more MTB in sputum than those carrying TT. CONCLUSION: P2X7 SNPs, 1513A>C and -762T>C, may be associated with the susceptibility to tuberculosis, and -762T>C SNP may contribute to the development of MTB. The mutant genotype of -762T>C (TC and CC) may lower human capability of phagocytosis to MTB, leading to an increased morbidity of TB."

Prednisone reduces morbidity in TB-IRIS, but the mechanisms are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of prednisone on the inflammatory response in TB-IRIS (antigen-specific effector T cells, cytokines, and chemokines). METHODS: Blood was taken from participants in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of prednisone for TB-IRIS, at 0, 2, and 4 weeks. Participants received prednisone at a dosage of 1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks followed by 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, or placebo at identical dosages. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Analyses included IFN- enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on peripheral blood mononuclear cells after restimulation with heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Luminex multiplex cytokine analysis of corresponding tissue culture supernatants, and Luminex multiplex cytokine analysis of serum. Fifty-eight participants with TB-IRIS (31 receiving prednisone, 27 receiving placebo) were included. In serum, significant decreases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, tumor necrosis factor-, IFN-, and IFN--induced protein-10 concentrations during prednisone, but not placebo, treatment were observed. No differences in ELISPOT responses comparing prednisone and placebo groups were shown in response to ESAT-6 (early secreted antigen target-6), Acr1, Acr2, 38-kD antigen, or heat-killed H37Rv M. tuberculosis. Purified protein derivative ELISPOT responses increased over 4 weeks in the prednisone group and decreased in the placebo group (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of prednisone in TB-IRIS appear to be mediated via suppression of predominantly proinflammatory cytokine responses of innate immune origin, not via a reduction of the numbers of antigen-specific T cells in peripheral blood."

We used transcriptional profiling to study these responses within the TST at molecular and system levels. Skin biopsies from TST injection sites were examined in subjects classified as TST(+) or TST(-) by clinical and histological criteria. Genome-wide expression arrays showed evolution of immune responses reflecting T-cell activation and recruitment with uniquely Th1-polarized responses and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). In addition, distinct innate immune and IFN--stimulated gene expression signatures were identified, under the regulation of NF-B and STAT1 transcriptional control. These were highly enriched for chemokines and MHC class II molecules providing a potential mechanism for paracrine amplification of inflammatory responses in the TST, by supporting cellular recruitment and enhancing antigen presentation. The same repertoire of innate and adaptive immune responses was evident in TST(+) and TST(-) subjects alike, clinically positive TSTs being distinguished only by quantitatively greater differences. These data provide new insights into complex multifaceted responses within the TST, with much greater sensitivity than previous clinical or histological assessments."

The chemokines and chemokine receptors that promote cell migration for granuloma formation, however, are not defined completely. As immunity to M.tb manifests slowly in the lungs, a better understanding of specific roles for chemokines, in particular those that promote M.tb-protective T(H)1 responses, may identify targets that could accelerate granuloma formation. The chemokine CCL5 has been detected in patients with TB and implicated in control of M.tb infection. To define a role for CCL5 in vivo during M.tb infection, CCL5 KO mice were infected with a low dose of aerosolized M.tb. During early M.tb infection, CCL5 KO mice localized fewer APCs and chemokine receptor-positive T cells to the lungs and had microscopic evidence of altered cell trafficking to M.tb granulomas. Early acquired immunity and granuloma function were transiently impaired when CCL5 was absent, evident by delayed IFN-gamma responses and poor control of M.tb growth. Lung cells from M.tb-infected CCL5 KO mice eventually reached or exceeded the levels of WT mice, likely as a result of partial compensation by the CCL5-related ligand, CCL4, and not because of CCL3. Finally, our results suggest that most T cells use CCR5 but not CCR1 to interact with these ligands. Overall, these results contribute to a model of M.tb granuloma formation dependent on temporal regulation of chemokines rather than on redundant or promiscuous interactions."

Currently, 2 NAA tests-enhanced Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct (MTD) Test (Gen-Probe, Inc) and Amplicor Mycobacterium tuberculosis Test (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc)-have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for testing respiratory specimens that are smear positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). This restriction to AFB smear-positive specimens was based on data from the initial clinical trials conducted to evaluate these products that showed low sensitivity (ie, 48%-53%) and less-than-optimal specificity (ie, 96%-99%) in AFB smear-negative specimens. Data from the clinical trial for the enhanced MTD test and from 2 subsequent studies, however, suggest that this version of the MTD test is a reliable tool for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary TB, regardless of the AFB smear result. Both NAA tests have been evaluated for diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB, and results were comparable to the results of tests performed with respiratory specimens. The NAA tests also appear to be reliable for rapid identification of M tuberculosis complex in positive broth cultures of all specimen types except blood. The impact of the NAA tests on patient outcome varies based on the AFB smear result. With smear-positive results, public health and hospital infection control resources are predominantly affected. With smear-negative results, however, the potential for affecting patient outcome is much greater. In patients with smear-negative results, the NAA test can result in earlier diagnosis of TB and subsequent initiation of therapy. Use of these tests also may eliminate the need for invasive diagnostic procedures, which are costly and pose an added risk to the patient, and they may allow earlier discharge of hospitalized patients."

Recruitment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific CD4+ T cells to the site of infection for diagnosis of active tuberculosis. J Intern Med 2008; 265: 163-168.Context. Accurate and early diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) is problematic as current diagnostic methods show low sensitivity (acid-fast bacilli smears), are time-consuming (culture of biological samples) or show variable results [Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific PCR]. Objectives. In the course of infection, MTB-specific T cells clonally expand at the site of infection and may thus be used as diagnostic marker for active disease. Design. In this cohort study, the frequency of MTB-specific, interferon (IFN)- expressing CD4+ T cells obtained from peripheral blood and the site of disease in 25 patients with suspected TB was assessed (n = 11, bronchoalveolar lavage; n = 7, pleural fluid; n = 1, ascites; n = 1, joint fluid; n = 5, cerebrospinal fluid). Results. Amongst 15 patients who showed proven active TB infection, a striking increase of MTB-specific T cells was detected at the site of infection compared with peripheral blood (median increase: 28.5-fold, range: 7.25-531 fold; median of IFN--producing CD4+ T cells from blood: 0.02%, range: 0-0.52%; median of IFN--producing CD4+ T cells from the site of infection: 1.81%, range: 0.29-6.55%, P &lt; 0.001). Main outcome measure. Recruitment of MTB-specific T cells to the site of infection yielded a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90%, irrespective of the compartment affected. Conclusions. The accumulation of MTB-specific T cells at the site of infection may prove as useful diagnostic marker for an accurate and rapid diagnosis of active TB.  2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

Post renal transplant infections are often elusive and require extensive evaluation for proper diagnosis and treatment. A high index of suspicion is required and an attempt should be made to confirm the microbiological diagnosis from each site involved to rule out multiple infections.Case presentation: We report a 50-year-old female, a renal allograft recipient who presented with left hemiplegia, esophageal ulcers and fever 3 months after her transplant. Esophageal biopsy revealed Cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclusions and the whole blood quantitative CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive. Neuroimaging showed a brain abscess, stereotactic biopsy from which revealed Scedosporium apiospermum on fungal culture. Her tacrolimus and mycophenolate were stopped and she was managed with intravenous ganciclovir and voriconazole. With these measures, she showed marked improvement in her general and neurological condition. Two months later, she developed recurrence of fever with dry cough. Radiological investigation revealed a cavitating lung lesion, a needle aspiration from which demonstrated acid-fast bacilli. She was started on antituberculous treatment. With these measures, she recovered completely and maintained good graft function despite being on only prednisolone 10 mg once a day.Conclusion: Although CMV disease is not uncommon in the first three months post transplant, Scedosporium is a rare cause of brain abscess. On the other hand, tuberculosis is common in transplant recipients, especially in developing countries, like India. However, this is the first case report of occurrence of these three infections in the same patient, demonstrating the importance of a good microbiological work-up from each site involved in immunosuppressed subjects.  2014 Rathi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

The culture is the gold standard to the diagnosis of the disease. Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis), the aetiological agent, is difficult to isolate and grow in culture. In this study, 24 randomly selected cows of the Fresian breed from a dairy herd with a history of Ptbc were used to evaluate the performance of different diagnostic techniques. These animals did not show clinical signs of the disease. However, another animal from this herd presented evidence of clinical disease at the moment of the present study. This animal was necropsied and one strain of M. paratuberculosis was isolated from faeces, lymph nodes and intestine. Serum for indirect absorbed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) tests and whole blood samples to perform gamma interferon (gammaIFN) release assays were obtained from each animal. Faeces and milk samples to carry out bacteriological cultures, PCR identification of M. paratuberculosis, and direct examinations of smears with Ziehl-Neelsen's (ZN) stain were also collected. Tuberculin test with bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) in the caudal fold was performed. The results showed that 10 out of 24 animals (41.6%) were positive to ELISA. Eight strains of M. paratuberculosis were isolated, six from faeces, two from milk. Five of the animals that excreted the bacteria through faeces were ELISA-positive, whereas the excreters through milk were negative to ELISA. No positive samples by AGID were obtained in clinical asymptomatic animals. Seven samples gave positive gammaIFN results with avian PPD, but only two of these animals were confirmed with culture. Direct PCR, to detect IS900 (M. paratuberculosis) in faeces and milk samples, was negative, but PCR using material taken from faecal and milk cultures gave positive results before visualizing the colonies. No sample was positive by PCR directed to IS6110 (M. tuberculosis complex). There was not always agreement between isolations and ZN in the studied samples. In conclusion, the absorbed ELISA was useful to detect positive animals and excreters through faeces but not through milk. PCR applied to cultures with incipient development before the visualization of colonies was effective to specifically determine the presence of M. paratuberculosis. The gammaIFN test was not able to detect the most positive animals confirmed by culture. The importance of using ELISA and cultures is emphasized by this study but it is necessary to continue with the gammaIFN test development for early detection of the disease."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a benzyl-alcohol guanidine hydrochloride (DNA extraction) method (GuHClM) on blood samples. DESIGN: GuHClM was evaluated in quantitatively spiked blood samples with M. tuberculosis. We assessed the insertion sequence (IS) 6110 region of M. tuberculosis to evaluate the efficacy of the method. The method was also applied on 102 clinical samples of suspected tuberculosis (TB) individuals and compared with smear microscopy of sputum specimens and the results of cultures. RESULTS: This method reproducibly detected as low as 4-6 bacilli. Of 102 clinical samples, 84 were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative, while 18 were HIV-positive. Among the HIV-negative individuals, 58.3% were TB-positive using PCR, while respectively 47.6% and 45.2% were sputum- and culture-positive. Among the HIV-positive individuals, 55.6% were PCR-positive, whereas only 38.9% were sputum-positive and 50% were culture-positive. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the identification of mycobacteria by PCR using GuHClM is very sensitive and therefore may have wide utility in the diagnosis of TB."

METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-five samples from 145 clinically suspected cases of tuberculosis were processed for the detection of Mycobacterial infections by ZN (Ziehl Neelsen) smear examination, L-J & BACTEC MGIT-960 culture and multiplex PCR tests. The multiplex PCR comprised of genus-specific primers targeting hsp65 gene, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex-specific primer targeting cfp10 (Rv3875, esxB) region and Mycobacterium avium complex-specific primer pairs targeting 16S-23S Internal Transcribed Spacer sequences. The multiplex PCR developed had an analytical sensitivity of 10 fg (3-4 cells) of mycobacterial DNA. The multiplex PCR test showed the highest (77.24%) detection rate, while ZN smear examination had the lowest (20%) detection rate, which was bettered by L-J culture (34.4%) and BACTEC MGIT-960 culture (50.34%) methods. The mean isolation time for M. tuberculosis was 19.03 days in L-J culture and 8.7 days in BACTEC MGIT-960 culture. Using the multiplex PCR, we could establish M. tuberculosis + M. avium co-infection in 1.3% HIV-negative and 2.9% HIV-positive patients. The multiplex PCR was also highly useful in diagnosing mycobacteraemia in 38.09% HIV-positive and 15.38% HIV-negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: The developed in-house multiplex PCR could identify and differentiate the M. tuberculosis and M. avium complexes from other Mycobacterial species directly from clinical specimens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The triplex PCR developed by us could be used to detect and differentiate M. tuberculosis, M. avium and other mycobacteria in a single reaction tube."

SUBJECTS: Fifty two sequential patients were enrolled. Thirty patients with FNAC diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis and positive PCR for M. tuberculosis complex had a mean age of 26.9 +/- 11.2 years and similar male, female affection. Nine patients with FNAC tuberculous lymphadenitis, but negative PCR had a slightly higher mean age (32.6 +/- 18.2 years) with similar male: female proportions.

FPA specificity was 99.9%. The FPA was used to identify herd status as either M. bovis infected or non-infected. Herd surveillance studies (nine herds) were performed in Mexico and South Africa. The FPA had a specificity of 100% (two negative herds), and correctly identified six of seven infected herds. Finally, sera from 105 slaughter animals that had gross lesions in lymph nodes similar to those seen with bovine tuberculosis were tested by the FPA. Thin sections from the associated formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of lymph nodes were stained using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for morphologic examination and using the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) method for detection of acid-fast bacilli. Of the 105 animals, 78 were classified as TB suspect based on lesion morphology, 21 were positive by ZN, 9 were positive by FPA and 13 were positive by PCR for the tuberculosis group of Mycobacterium.

Among the most recent methods are Isolator blood culture, radiometric detection, hybridization and amplification, each with its advantages and disadvantages. The Isolator blood culture system improves the sensitivity of mycobacteria detection, especially for Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare. In terms of cost and culture time, this system is similar to traditional methods, although it is limited to blood cultures. Radiometric detection, associated with culture in a liquid medium, greatly improves diagnostic power. The main advantage lies in the reduced delay before detection, 13.4 days compared with 21.7 days on solid media (for M. tuberculosis) and 5.1 days instead of 18.6 days for other mycobacteria. A culture is considered to be negative after 6 weeks without growth compared with 12 weeks for the Lwenstein-Jensen medium. The disadvantages of this system include the cost of equipment, personnel and radio-active products. In addition, as for all culture methods, a sufficient bacterial population is required in the sample. Hybridization techniques rely on DNA or RNA probes which recognize mycobacterial sequences. The Gen-Probe recognizes M. tuberculosis, M. avium, M. intracellulare and M. gordonae ribosomal RNA. Syngene probes recognize M. tuberculosis and M. avium-intracellulare DNA sequences. Rapid identification in less than 2 hours is a major advantage. At the present time 50 pg of DNA are required, a quantity which is not usually present in clinical samples. Combining this technique with primary culture in liquid medium or amplification techniques improves sensitivity. Polymerase chain reaction amplifies a specific sequence of double strand DNA. This method provides a means of identifying mycobacterial DNA in a clinical sample within 24-48 hours, a major improvement over traditional culture. Cost however may be a barrier although the cost/benefit ration remains to be determined."

Methods: A total of 103 CD and 88 ITB patients, confirmed by histology and anti-tuberculosis treatment response from 2003 to 2011, were included. Their characteristics and clinical features were recorded. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of IS6110, in vitro T-SPOT.TB, tuberculin skin test (TST), immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to MTB (protein chip), serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA IgG, chronic inflammatory bowel disease profile) and acid-fast staining of biopsied colonic tissue specimens were performed. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine their concordance with the diagnosis and its sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). Results: Abnormal pulmonary X-ray, ascites and lesions of both cecum and ascending colon were more associated with ITB, while intestinal surgery and lesions of both ileum and adjacent colon were more commonly seen in CD. Significant diagnostic concordance was found using T-SPOT.TB (=0.786) by consistency test. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of T-SPOT.TB were 86%, 93%, 88% and 91%, respectively, and the sensitivity and NPV were significantly higher than other examinations (P<0.05).

Tests of humoral (antibody) immunity, Mycobacterium bovis PCR probes on early tissue cultures or live cattle specimens, and tests based on ""electronic nose"" technology have been developed more recently. The key measure of diagnostic test accuracy is the relationship between sensitivity and specificity, which determines the false-positive and false-negative proportions. None of the tests currently available for the diagnosis of bovine TB allow a perfectly accurate determination of the M. bovis infection status of cattle. Although various factors can reduce the sensitivity and specificity of the skin tests, these remain the primary ante mortem diagnostic tools for TB in cattle, providing a cost-effective and reliable means of screening entire cattle populations. Despite the inescapable limitations of existing diagnostic tests, bovine TB has been effectively eradicated from many developed countries and regions with the implementation of sound programmes of regular tuberculin skin testing and removal of reactors, coupled with slaughterhouse surveillance for undetected infections, repeat testing and culling of infected herds, cattle movement restrictions to prevent introduction of infected animals and occasional slaughter of entire herds with intractable breakdowns. This is likely to remain the mainstay of bovine TB control programmes for the foreseeable future. Additionally, newer ancillary in vitro diagnostic assays are now available to TB control programme managers to supplement the skin tests in defined circumstances according to the specific disease situation in each country or region. The strategic deployment of ancillary in vitro tests alongside the primary skin tests has enhanced the detection of M. bovis-infected cattle and reduced the number of animals slaughtered as false positives."

Although sensitivity by using such antigens might be similar to that obtained by using crude or semipurified antigens, specificity was somewhat improved to over 95%. Among serological tools, ELISA has been the method of choice for detecting serum antibodies and mycobacterial antigens from clinical specimens because of its high sensitivity, simplicity, reproducibility and versatility in screening a large number of specimens. Further simple and rapid tests such as the agglutination test by coating various particles with purified or synthetic M. tuberculosis-specific antigens or antibodies will soon become available for field evaluation in endemic areas of tuberculosis. However, all these efforts can be justified only if serological tests give any meaningful information for the diagnosis and management of tuberculosis or for determining the degree of M. tuberculosis transmission in a community as a complement to the current tuberculin test, chest X-ray, or sputum examination. Although the detection of mycobacterial antigens from CSF or sputum specimens using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies gave more direct evidence for M. tuberculosis infection, the information by the assays was not sufficient to determine whether these immunological tools could be used in clinical laboratories for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Meanwhile, recent introduction of the very sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology for the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA from clinical specimens (37-40) may eventually replace the immunological assays for the detection of mycobacterial antigens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Some proteins with serodiagnostic value are not expressed under normal culture conditions, but may be induced under specific conditions such as gradual oxygen depletion and low pH, and from inside macrophages. Using a customized amplification library, we previously found that Rv2041c from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was highly expressed in vitro under conditions of low pH and hypoxia. In this study, recombinant (r)Rv2041c was produced in Escherichia coli to examine its role in immune responses. Increased Rv2041c expression in vitro during dormancy and during infection in human macrophages was confirmed by Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Interestingly, positive antibody responses to rRv2041c were detected only in those patients with active tuberculosis (TB) and in mice infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Finally, Rv2041c was used successfully in the serodiagnosis of active M. tuberculosis infection in Korean patients in conjunction with other M. tuberculosis proteins, including Ag85 complex, 38 kDa, rESAT-6, rHSP-X and rCFP-10. Our Rv2041c-ELISA had comparable diagnostic sensitivity and equivalent specificity to the use of an M. tuberculosis H37Rv cellular extract. In addition, seven of 46 serum samples collected from TB patients (15.28%) showed positive antibody responses to Rv2041c, but not to the other proteins. These results suggest that Rv2041c can be used to increase assay sensitivity alongside well-known antigens for the serodiagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection."

We compared the frequencies of HLA-C and HLA-BW4 genes, the expression of KIRs 2DL1/2DS1, 2DL2/2DL3, 3DL1, and 2DS4 and the combinations of HLA/KIR in 32 Nifamycin and Isoniazid-resistant TB with those in 68 drug non resistant (NR) sputum smear positive pulmonary TB patients. PCR-SSP and flow cytometry were performed for HLA and KIRs typing, respectively. We showed no significant differences between inhibitory or activating KIRs as well as HLA ligands in MDR TB patients compared with NR-TB . The combinations of inhibitory KIR-HLA ligands in MDR-TB were much more prevalent, but not statistically significant than in NR patients (p=0.07). The frequency of MDR patients with all HLA-C and HLA-BW4 ligands was higher than NR-TB (p<0.009). Conversely, the percentage of MDR patients having only one kind of HLA gene was significantly lower than NR-TB (p<0.01). We conclude that the expression of inhibitory KIRs with corresponding HLA ligands genes, and/or co-existence of three HLA class 1 ligands for inhibitory KIRs may be associated with drug resistance in pulmonary tuberculosis."

RISK6 utility was validated by blind prediction using quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR in seven independent cohorts. Prognostic performance significantly exceeded that of previous signatures discovered in the same cohort. Performance for diagnosing subclinical and clinical disease in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected persons, assessed by area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, exceeded 85%. As a screening test for tuberculosis, the sensitivity at 90% specificity met or approached the benchmarks set out in World Health Organization target product profiles for non-sputum-based tests. RISK6 scores correlated with lung immunopathology activity, measured by positron emission tomography, and tracked treatment response, demonstrating utility as treatment response biomarker, while predicting treatment failure prior to treatment initiation. Performance of the test in capillary blood samples collected by finger-prick was noninferior to venous blood collected in PAXgene tubes. These results support incorporation of RISK6 into rapid, capillary blood-based point-of-care PCR devices for prospective assessment in field studies."

Objectives: Following a proof of principle study, we examined in routine clinical practice whether individuals with sputum AFB smear-negative TB can be discriminated from those with latent TB infection by local immunodiagnosis with a Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. Methods: Subjects suspected of having active TB who were unable to produce sputum or with AFB-negative sputum smears were prospectively enrolled at Tuberculosis Network European Trialsgroup centers in Europe. ELISpot with early-secretory-antigenic- target-6 and culture-filtrate-protein-10 peptides was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bronchoalveolar lavage mononuclear cells (BALMCs). M. tuberculosis-specific nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) was performed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Measurements and Main Results: Seventy-one of 347 (20.4%) patients had active TB. Out of 276 patients who had an alternative diagnosis, 127 (46.0%) were considered to be latently infected with M. tuberculosis by a positive PBMC ELISpot result. The sensitivity and specificity of BALMC ELISpot for the diagnosis of active pulmonary TB were 91 and 80%, respectively. The BALMC ELISpot (diagnostic odds ratio [OR], 40.4) was superior to PBMC ELISpot (OR, 10.0), tuberculin skin test (OR, 7.8), and M. tuberculosis specific NAAT (OR, 12.4) to diagnose sputum AFB smear-negative TB. In contrast to PBMC ELISpot and tuberculin skin test, the BALMC ELISpot was not influenced by previous history of TB. Conclusions: Bronchoalveolar lavage ELISpot is an important advancement to rapidly distinguish sputum AFB smear-negative TB from latent TB infection in routine clinical practice."

By using nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, one may be able to diagnose, the disease on the day of arrival of specimen in the laboratory. For diagnosis of tuberculosis by direct methods like PCR, specimens from site of infection are required. In certain cases it is difficult to get the specimens from site of infection and in such situations; some researchers have tried to detect the DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from blood of these patients. The purposive of this study is to determine the diagnostic efficacy of peripheral blood-based polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: This was a simple descriptive study, carried out in Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi from Jan 2004 to Dec 2004. Sputum and blood samples were collected from 96 suspected patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum samples processed for ZN staining and AFB culture (gold standard) and blood samples processed for PCR. RESULTS: Out of 96 cases, 60 (62.5%) were culture positive. PCR was positive in 14 (14.5%). AFB smear positive were 34 (35.4%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 20% and 94.4% respectively and the positive and negative predictive values were 85.71% and 41.46% respectively. The overall efficiency of the test was 47.91%. CONCLUSION: Due to low sensitivity; a negative PCR assay does not rule the disease. However, this test may be helpful in cases where specimens from the site of infection are not available."

From the gene to the diagnosis].,0,"Pulmonary tuberculosis still in on the list of the world major health problems. Tuberculosis has not been eradicated yet, from developing countries. Furthermore, its incidence is increasing in the industrialized world, due to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. In this regard, atypical clinical presentation of tuberculosis in individuals who have a deficient immune system, such as those at risk of tuberculosis because of HIV infection, makes the diagnostic process more difficult. Tuberculosis cases are often diagnosed later in HIV individuals compared to non-HIV individuals. The ensuing greater risk of contagion thus requires rapid and sensitive diagnostic protocols. In this context, several biotechnological tools have been developed that can be applied to the diagnosis of tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis genes have been cloned, monoclonal antibodies against pure proteins have been produced, thus enabling researchers to generate molecular and biochemical probes. As a consequence, DNA hybridization and DNA amplification techniques have been applied to the detection of mycobacteria, and ELISA kits of high sensitivity are been already made available. In regard to the latter, it is likely that monospecific and highly sensitive immunoassays will be developed that are directed against ""active disease"" immunodominant antigens. It may thus be expected that future new technologies will supplement the traditional tools for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and rapid diagnosis protocols will be available to chest clinicians in a foreseeable future."

The NKT KO mice developed granulomatous lesions in the lungs; there was no statistically significant difference in pulmonary granuloma size between NKT KO and WT mice (p<0.01). The average CFU values increased 3 weeks post-infection, but decreased 9 and 11 weeks post-infection, in the lungs of NKT KO mice. When stimulated with Kurono strain in vitro, splenic cells from NKT KO mice produced less IFN-gamma than did those from WT mice. Expression of mRNA for IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 p40 was slightly lower in NKT KO mice compared with WT mice. Our data indicate that NKT cells play a detrimental role in late-phase mycobacterial infection, although Th1 cells are essential in early-phase mycobacterial infection."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiology of lower respiratory tract disease among persons with suspected tuberculosis (TB) and abnormal chest X-rays in a setting with very high HIV seroprevalence. DESIGN: Cross-sectional prevalence data from a prospective cohort of predominantly hospitalized adults with suspected TB in Botswana, January-December 1997. RESULTS: Of 229 patients, 86% were HIV-positive and 71% had a pathogen identified. TB was confirmed in 52%, 17% had acute mycoplasma pneumonia, 3% had Pneumocystis carinii, 27% grew a bacterial pathogen from sputum and 8% from blood. Ninety-four per cent of TB diagnoses were made through expectorated sputum and only 5% of TB cases were diagnosed by sputum induction alone. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis had positive and negative predictive values of 94% and 59%, respectively. Male sex, cough < 2 weeks, and tuberculin skin test > or = 5 mm were independently associated with culture-positive TB among persons with negative acid-fast bacilli smears. Co-infection with two or more pathogens occurred in 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was quite common despite clinical suspicion of TB, and sputum induction and PCR did not significantly improve our ability to diagnose TB, although clinical presentation had some predictive value."

Recently, we identified an immunodominant T-cell antigen, Rv2645, from the region of deletion 13 (RD13) of M. tuberculosis (M. tb) H37Rv, which is absent in Bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG). Here, a recombinant BCG expressing Rv2645, namely, BCG::Rv2645, was constructed. Compared to BCG, we found that BCG::Rv2645 improved the antigen presentation capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) and elicited much stronger Th1 and Th17 responses, higher CD44(high)CD62(low) effector memory CD4(+) T cells (T(EM)), and fewer T regulated cells (Treg) and regulatory B10 in mice. Importantly, BCG::Rv2645 exhibited enhanced protective efficacy against virulent M. tb H37Rv challenge in both mice and rhesus monkeys, showing less severe pathology and reduced pathogens. Further, transcriptomic analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative real time PCR revealed that the mRNA levels of ISGylation (Isg)-related genes such as interferon-stimulated gene 15 (Isg15), and Th1- and Th17-related genes such as interferon- (IFN-) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) were significantly up-regulated in splenocytes and macrophages after stimulation with Rv2645. This study shows that BCG::Rv2645 is a promising TB vaccine candidate with enhanced protective immunity. The enhanced Th1/Th17 immune responses and up-regulation of ISGylation-related genes induced by Rv2645 may be major factors contributing to the protective immunity of BCG::Rv2645."

Tuberculosis infection was associated with tissue remodeling of lymph nodes as well as altered cellular composition. Granulomas were significantly enriched with CD68+ macrophages expressing the M. tuberculosis complex-specific protein antigen MPT64 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. There was a significant increase in CD8+ cytolytic T cells surrounding the granuloma; however, CD8+ T cells expressed low levels of the cytolytic and antimicrobial effector molecules perforin and granulysin in the granulomatous lesions. Quantitative real-time mRNA analysis revealed that interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-17 were not up-regulated in infected lymph nodes, but there was a significant induction of both transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-13. In addition, granulomas contained an increased number of CD4+FoxP3+ T cells co-expressing the immunoregulatory cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor molecules. Low numbers of CD8+ T cells in the lesions correlated with high levels of transforming growth factor-beta and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, suggesting active immunosuppression at the local infection site. Compartmentalization and skewing of the immune response toward a regulatory phenotype may result in an uncoordinated effector T-cell response that reduces granule-mediated killing of M. tuberculosis-infected cells and subsequent disease control."

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of TB in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blood and extra-pulmonary samples from patients with AIDS and pulmonary infiltrates. DESIGN: Specimens from 103 HIV-1-infected patients were prospectively analysed using bacteriological methods and IS6110-PCR. Smear-positive samples were also tested using 16S ribosomal-DNA-PCR to identify Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. Gold standard diagnosis relied on positive cultures or treatment outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients exhibited TB, one TB and MAC and four MAC. The sensitivity of IS6110-PCR was 100% in smear-positive samples, 81.8% in smear-negative BAL, 66.7% in extra-pulmonary samples and 42.9% in blood. Its specificity was 97.1% in BAL and 100% in extra-pulmonary and blood specimens. The 16S rDNA-PCR identified M. avium from all smear-positive samples that grew MAC.

In the present study, a combination of bioinformatics, molecular biology, and bovine models of infection were used to screen mycobacterial proteins for their potential as diagnostic reagents which could be used in a whole-blood assay for diagnosis of tuberculosis. Initial screening of 28 proteins selected in silico and expressed as recombinants in Escherichia coli indicated that CFP-10, ESAT-6, TB27.4, TB16.2, TB15.8, and TB10.4 induced strong gamma interferon responses in experimentally infected cattle. A more thorough investigation over time in two groups of animals infected with a high (10(6) CFU) and a low (10(4) CFU) dose of M. bovis revealed that, for both groups, the strength of the in vitro response to individual antigens varied greatly over time. However, combining the results for ESAT-6, CFP-10, and TB27.4, possibly supplemented with TB10.4, gave sensitivities at different infection stages close to those obtained with M. bovis purified protein derivative. Importantly, while responsiveness to ESAT-6 and CFP-10 correlated strongly for individual samples, the same was not the case for ESAT-6 and TB27.4 responsiveness. The results suggest that combinations of specific antigens such as these have great potential in development of optimized diagnostic systems for bovine tuberculosis."

METHODS: Detection of the M. tuberculosis complex in blood samples using as a target the insertion sequence IS6110 of the genomic DNA of the bacillus. Blood samples of 120 patients were evaluated. All of the patients were under 15 years of age at the time of their treatment at public hospitals in the city of Recife, Brazil (between January of 2003 and August of 2005). Attending physicians at the hospitals diagnosed TB based on the criteria recommended by the American Thoracic Society. The nPCR amplified a 123-bp fragment with outer oligonucleotides (IS1/IS2) and, in the subsequent reaction, using inner oligonucleotides (IS3/IS4), generating an 81-bp amplicon. RESULTS: Active or latent TB was found in 65 patients, TB was ruled out in 28 suspected cases, and 27 patients were TB-free (controls).

In PBMCs, mRNA expressions of visfatin and lipocalin-2 were detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the diagnostic value of these adipokine mRNAs in PTB patients was calculated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: In PBMCs from PTB patients, the visfatin mRNA level was significantly higher than in healthy controls (P<.001), with no significant association between the lipocalin-2 mRNA level and PTB patients (P=.933). In PTB patients, lipocalin-2 mRNA expression positively correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P=.010). However, the visfatin mRNA level was not associated with any major clinical and laboratory parameter in PTB patients. The ROC curve demonstrated that visfatin could help distinguish PTB patients from healthy controls, with an optimal cutoff value of 0.645 and a corresponding sensitivity of 79.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The altered visfatin mRNA expression indicated that this adipokine might play a role in PTB and could be an auxiliary biomarker for PTB diagnosis."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical relevance of detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. DESIGN: Single-centre prospective case study of 90 hospitalised patients and 50 healthy subjects or blood donors from 1 January to 30 June 1998. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis (26.7%); 20 tuberculosis patients were culture-positive, with seven smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli. Sensitivity of smear, culture and nested PCR was 30.4 (7/23), 87 (20/23) and 30.4% (7/23), respectively. The specificity of smear and culture was 100%, and the specificity of the nested PCR was 96% in the healthy subjects. However, the specificity decreased to 83.6% in the hospitalised patients, with 11 nested PCR-positive patients without a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The sensitivity of the nested PCR was low in pulmonary tuberculosis (22.2%), but increased in pulmonary/extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (50%), extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (33%), and disseminated tuberculosis (33%). CONCLUSION: The use of a nested PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis with regard to low sensitivity and specificity. However, further studies are needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of paucibacillary forms of tuberculosis."

The specimens included urine; feces; lymph node exudates; pleural, cerebrospinal, articular, and ascitic fluids; tissue biopsies; gastric aspirates; purulent exudates; blood; and bone marrow aspirates. After combination of the culture results and the patient's clinical data, a total of 135 specimens were collected from 122 patients with a diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay were 77.7, 98.7, 95.2, and 93.1%, respectively; these values rose in resolved cases of TB to 78.5, 100, 100, and 93.1%, respectively. For 37 (27.4%) specimens from patients smear positive for the disease and 98 (72.6%) specimens from patients smear negative for the disease, the sensitivities of the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay were 100 and 71.1%, respectively. Statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) in sensitivities were found between culture and the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay. These differences were even greater among smear-negative specimens. The results demonstrate that the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay will provide rapid and valuable information for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis."

Diabetes is a known risk factor for tuberculosis and associated with poor tuberculosis treatment outcomes, while tuberculosis is associated with worsening glycemic control. We investigated the performance of bi-directional TB and DM case finding approaches through a private-sector engagement model in Karachi, Pakistan. METHODS: Between July 2016 and July 2018, private health care providers were engaged to generate referrals for bi-directional TB and DM screening at private diagnostic and treatment centers in Karachi, Pakistan. Individuals diagnosed with TB underwent glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing at the time of anti-tuberculous treatment initiation and at three -month follow up stage. All individuals with a history of diabetes or random blood sugar of greater than 200mg/dl were screened for TB using a chest X-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF. RESULTS: A total of 6312 persons with tuberculosis were tested on HbA1c at treatment initiation, of whom 1516 (24%) were newly diagnosed with DM. About one third of those with HbA1c in the diabetic range ( 6.5%) at baseline were found to have a normal HbA1c (<5.7%) result at 3-month follow-up. A total of 3824 individuals with DM, of whom 2396 (63%) were known cases and 1428 (37%) were newly identified with random blood sugar >200mg/dl, underwent chest x-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF testing, with 321 (13.4%) known and 54 (3.8%) new diabetics respectively identified with tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a high yield of TB and DM through bidirectional screening and the feasibility of engagement of private sector in finding missing cases of tuberculosis and diabetes. Given the high prevalence of undiagnosed DM in individuals with TB tuberculosis patients, there is a need to scale-up DM screening within TB programmes. Increased awareness of the high risk of TB among individuals with DM is needed among private health providers and screening for TB among diabetics should be strongly considered."

Historically, diagnosis of tuberculosis has relied largely upon assays of cell-mediated immunity (CMI), such as tuberculin skin testing. This approach, however, is problematic or impractical for use with many wildlife species. Increasingly, in vitro diagnostic tests, including gamma interferon (IFN-)-based assays, are replacing or complementing skin testing of cattle and humans. Analogous assays are unavailable for most wildlife because of a lack of species-specific immunological reagents. This report describes the development and validation of a whole-blood assay to quantify antigen-specific IFN- mRNA expression by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Oligonucleotide primers and probes were designed and tested for reactivity towards several susceptible species of interest with respect to tuberculosis infection. The assay was subsequently optimized to quantify the IFN- mRNA expression in elk and red deer (Cervus elaphus) and was evaluated for its ability to detect mycobacterial antigen-specific responses of experimentally tuberculosis-infected animals. The assay was a simple, rapid, and sensitive measure of antigen-specific CMI. The IFN- mRNA responses correlated well with IFN- protein production and showed performance in determining an animal's infection status superior to that of either lymphocyte proliferation or IFN- protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods. An additional advantage is the ease with which the assay can be modified to reliably quantify IFN- expression by using consensus sequences of closely related species or of other species for which IFN- sequence information is available.

Improved case management and preventive strategies require better understanding of the impact of HIV on causes, clinical presentation, and outcome. Methods: A prospective, clinical descriptive study of Malawian infants and children with severe pneumonia included blood culture and nasopharyngeal aspiration for diagnosis of pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP). A select group with consolidation on chest radiograph, and without severe hypoxia or hyperinflation, also had lung aspirate taken for culture and identification of bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: There were 327 study patients with a median age of 11 months (range, 2 months-14 years). HIV prevalence was 51%. There were 58 cases of confirmed bacterial pneumonia, of which the most common bacterial isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium. Of the 54 lung aspirates, only 2 were positive on culture but 27 were positive for bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid by PCR. PcP was confirmed in 16 patients, and was associated with young age, severe hypoxia, HIV infection, and a very poor outcome. The overall case-fatality rate was 10% despite presumptive therapy for PcP and routine broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment appropriate for local antimicrobial susceptibility data. Most of the deaths occurred in infants of 2 to 6 months of age and PcP was associated with 57% of these deaths. Conclusions: PcP is a major barrier in reducing the case-fatality rate of severe pneumonia in infants of HIV-endemic communities. The use of PCR on lung aspirate specimens greatly increased the diagnostic yield.  2010 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed pleural effusion at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from June 2012 to March 2013 were enrolled and divided into 3 groups of TPE, malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and non-tuberculous non-malignant pleural effusion (non-TPE non-MPE) according to the nature of pleural effusion. The level of sPD-L1 in pleural effusion and peripheral blood was analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Flow cytometry was used to detect the changes of immune cell subsets in pleural effusion. And the gene expressions of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) were detected in different effusions by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 77 newly diagnosed patients with pleural effusion were enrolled, 24 patients with TPE, 39 patients with MPE, 14 patients with non-TPE non-MPE. The level of sPD-L1 in TPE was higher than that in MPE and non-TPE non-MPE (4.2 (2.6-6.3), 1.4 (0.8-2.1), 1.8 (1.2-2.6) g/L, P < 0.001). No significant difference existed in the levels of sPD-L1 in peripheral blood samples (P = 0.811). The average content of sPD-L1 in pleural effusion in all patients was statistically higher than that in peripheral blood (2.0 (1.4-3.7), 1.5 (1.0-2.0) g/L, P = 0.004). The proportion of CD8 subset, PD-L1 on CD14(+) monocytes and the mRNA level of PD-L1, MMP-3 in TPE were higher than in MPE and non-TPE non-MPE (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001), and the mRNA level of PD-L1 in TPE was positively correlated with the level of MMP-3 (r = 0.887, P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that sPD-L1 had a sensitivity of 82.6%, a specificity of 83.8% and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.854 for differential diagnosis of TPE from other conditions. Combinations of sPD-L1, PD-L1 on CD14(+) monocytes and adenosine deaminase (ADA) measurements further increased the sensitivity up to 91.3%, specificity up to 89.2% and AUC up to 0.989. CONCLUSION: The elevated expression of sPD-L1 in tuberculous pleural effusion may aid the diagnosis of TPE."

In this study, the IFN-gamma assays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of TB were compared. METHODS: A prospective comparison of the performance of 2 commercial IFN-gamma assays - QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) and T-SPOT.TB (T SPOT) - and PCR using the Roche Cobas Amplicor Mycobacterium tuberculosis (RCA-TB) assay for the rapid diagnosis of TB was conducted from January 2007 to December 2007 at a university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan. RESULTS: Of 187 patients enrolled in the study, results from both T SPOT and QFT-G were available for 154, including 109 patients with active TB and 45 with no TB. The sensitivity of T SPOT (89.0%) was higher than that of QFT-G (71.4%). RCA-TB had the highest sensitivity (90.2%) and specificity (100%), but was usually performed in patients with positive acid-fast bacilli smear test. In patients with extrapulmonary TB, T SPOT had a high diagnostic value (sensitivity, 81.3%). A significant discordance between the 2 IFN-gamma assays was also noted. IFN-gamma assays provided a more rapid diagnosis for tuberculosis than the conventional culture method (mean +/- standard deviation, 8.23 +/- 12.86 days; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of IFN-gamma may shorten the time to diagnosis of TB, especially for smear-negative patients and those with extrapulmonary disease."

Pathogenic mycobacteria survive in the host by subverting host innate immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that are vital for eliciting immune responses to infectious agents, including pathogenic mycobacteria. DCs orchestrate distinct Th responses based on the signals they receive. In this perspective, deciphering the interactions of the proline-glutamic acid/proline-proline-glutamic acid (PE/PPE) family of proteins of M. tuberculosis with DCs assumes significant pathophysiological attributes. In this study, we demonstrate that Rv1917c (PPE34), a representative member of the proline-proline-glutamic-major polymorphic tandem repeat family, interacts with TLR2 and triggers functional maturation of human DCs. Signaling perturbations implicated a critical role for integrated cross-talk among PI3K-MAPK and NF-B signaling cascades in Rv1917c-induced maturation of DCs. However, this maturation of DCs was associated with a secretion of high amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, whereas Th1-polarizing cytokine IL-12 was not induced. Consistent with these results, Rv1917c-matured DCs favored secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 from CD4(+) T cells and contributed to Th2-skewed cytokine balance ex vivo in healthy individuals and in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Interestingly, the Rv1917c-skewed Th2 immune response involved induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in DCs. Taken together, these results indicate that Rv1917c facilitates a shift in the ensuing immunity toward the Th2 phenotype and could aid in immune evasion by mycobacteria."

Of the 120 patients, 7 (5.8%) were HBV positive and 30 (25.0%) were Mtb positive. This highlights the fact that dental health care workers (DHCWs) can be exposed to the risk of infection from blood- or saliva-borne pathogens as a consequence of their work. Therefore, it is very important to prevent cross infection between patients and dental personnel. Accordingly, laboratory tests prior to surgical treatment are needed to determine the infectious state of dental patients in order to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases in dental clinics."

In order to compare different tuberculosis diagnostic tests and to reach disease confirmation, a study was performed in a group of 14 steers of Friesian breed, reacting positively to tuberculin test. Three ante-mortem assays were performed according to the type of sample: the gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) test (which quantifies the release of this cytokine by sensitized lymphocytes in whole blood in response to purified protein derivative (PPD) and recombinant ESAT-6 and CFP10 proteins); PCR and bacteriologic culture from nasal swab and intradermal tuberculin test. These assays were taken at different times to assess the evolution of clinical parameters.

Thirty six samples of differently localized atypical tuberculous lesions and granulomatous tuberculoid lesions negative for acid fast bacilli and 4 positive cases on Ziehl-Nielsen stain were analysed by PCR for MT detection and were tested immunohistochemically (IHC) for the cellular immune response in the granulomas and perigranulomatous tissue. The samples selected were: 7 pulmonary and 33 extrapulmonary specimens, especially lymph nodes. Histologically, the atypical tuberculous lesions contained supurative necrosis, defective granulomas and cellular polymorphism. The epithelioid cells showed frequent mitoses. The immunoprofile of cells was polymorphous. L26 positive small lymphocytes were found in nodular lymphoid aggregates surrounding granulomas. A significantly increased number of positive UCHL1 cells were found in 33 out of the 40 analysed cases, with a larger percentage of CD4 positive T cells (81.8% of cases). CD44 was positive in multinucleated giant cells (17.5% of cases), epithelioid cells (60% of cases) and lymphocytes (30% of cases). CD68 was localized in multinucleated giant cells and epithelioid cells, in a 4%, respectively 62.5% of cases. The PCR was performed in all 40 cases; the tissue samples were heterogeneous (lung, lymph nodes, lever, nasopharynx, etc.) and needed a good quality extraction of DNA. Performing a control PCR for Beta Globin tested the extraction; a good result was obtained in 31 cases (77.5%); from these, 19 cases had amplification for IS 6110. The cellular immune response in the atypical tuberculous lesions was similar in cases with and without acid-fast bacilli, but positive for PCR. In the most cases with negative PCR reaction, it was due to a deficient fixation of the material. The T lymphocytes were numerous in all types of tuberculous granulomas, with the prominence of CD4 positive subtype. The immunoprofile of the epithelioid cells, positive for CD44 and CD68, presenting frequently mitoses suggests an activate state in a possible relationship to the T-cell-mediated immune response in tuberculosis."

However, the prognostic significance of these mutations and also the serum EGFR and its ligands in Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) has remained a challenging issue. This study is aimed at finding the prognostic importance of EGFR rare mutations and serum EGFR, amphiregulin (AR), and TGF- (Transforming Growth Factor-alpha) in NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHOD: NSCLC patients (n=98) with mean age of 5910.5 were enrolled (M/F: 75/23). DNA was extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues. Exons 19 and 21 were amplified using polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing for identification of mutations. Serum EGFR, AR, and TGF- were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: EGFR mutation rate in patients was 37% (exon 19 deletions: 72.2%, exon 21 substitutions: 27.8%). The E872K in exon 21 mutation-positive cases was the most frequent rare mutation detected (90%; 9/10 samples). A significant relationship was found between EGFR exon 21mutations and serum EGFR and TGF- (P<0.05). Increased serum AR (>3pg/ml) and TGF- (>10.5pg/ml) were associated with shorter overall survival (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data clearly show that elevation of serum TGF- and AR are associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC. In addition to the close relationship between EGFR mutations and serum EGFR, serum TGF- changes was associated with the gene mutations. These findings could be implicated in clinical decision making related to EGFR-TKIs."

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Detailed examination was performed in 111 HIV-infected patients with suggested diagnosis of PP. The following investigations were made: clinical, x-ray examinations, total count and biochemical blood tests, enzyme immunoassay, indirect immunofluorescence reaction (II-FR) for Pneumocystis jiroveci antigens in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or induced sputum. For diagnosis of other secondary diseases PCR was used for investigation of BALF and bronchial biopsy to detect DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Candida albicans, Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Mycoplasma spa., Herpes simplex I, II. DNA of cytomegalovirus in blood was detected with PCR. Microscopic tests of the sputum were conducted for detection of acid-resistant mycobacteria. RESULTS: PP was associated with other secondary diseases in 59% patients (pulmonary tuberculosis ---16%, CMV pneumonia--31%, combination of all the lesions--5%). PP diagnosis was cancelled and pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 12 patients. In combination of PP with other pathology dominant were symptoms observed in PP monoinfection and only effective anti-pneumocystic treatment revealed signs of comorbid pathology. Tuberculosis patients had weaker signs of respiratory failure, symmetric bilateral interstitial or small-focal alterations were detected less frequently. CONCLUSION: Current PP course characteristics in HIV infection are identified. In clinical diagnosis of PP special attention should be paid to data complex especially to increasing respiratory failure, high ESR, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low blood pO2, fast response to ex juvantibus therapy. The most effective method of the diagnosis verification--BALF IIFR."

Comparison revealed significant differences in the expression of genes for Rab13, Rab24, and Rab33A. Rab33A gene expression was down-regulated in patients with TB and was predominantly expressed in CD8+ T cells. We excluded possible influences of differences in T cell percentages between the 2 study groups, demonstrating that Rab33A gene expression changes on the single-cell level. In vitro, Rab33A RNA expression was induced in T cells on activation and by dendritic cells infected with M. tuberculosis. Our findings identify Rab33A as a T cell regulatory molecule in TB and suggest its involvement in disease processes."

Using high-speed cell sorting in conjunction with real-time RT-PCR analysis, we show that sorted alveolar macrophages of transgenic CX3CR1+/GFP mice infected with red fluorescent-labelled Mycobacterium bovis BCG exhibited weak transcriptional changes of lysosomal cathepsins B, L, D, K and S, whereas antimicrobial cathepsin G was strongly induced upon infection. Moreover, mRNA levels of pattern recognition receptors TLR2, TLR4 and NOD2 were downregulated as were neutrophil chemoattractants KC, MIP-2 and IP-10, whereas highly upregulated mRNA levels of the monocyte chemoattractant CCL2 were observed. M. bovis BCG infection of the mice elicited the alveolar accumulation of highly CX3CR1-positive alveolar dendritic cells but not neutrophils within the alveolar compartment, whereas no increased accumulation of CX3CR1high lung parenchymal dendritic cells (lung DC) or CX3CR1neg lung macrophages compared with controls was noted. In contrast, CX3CR1+/GFP mice previously immunized with M. bovis BCG rapidly responded with increased accumulations of both CX3CR1high alveolar and lung parenchymal DC and CX3CR1neg lung macrophages upon intratracheal M. bovis BCG challenge. Moreover, alveolar and lung macrophages and lung DC were found to contribute to early uptake of M. bovis BCG. Together, acute mycobacterial infection triggers both rapid changes in gene expression profiles in infected alveolar macrophages and a compartment-specific accumulation of mononuclear phagocyte subsets contributing to M. bovis BCG uptake in vivo."

The histological diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) comprises various aspects: (1) sensitive detection of mycobacteria; (2) precise localization of mycobacteria in the context of granulomatous lesions; (3) 'staging' of disease according to mycobacterial spread and granulomatous tissue integrity. Thus, detection of minute numbers of acid-fast bacteria in tissue specimens is critical. The conventional ZN stain fails to identify mycobacteria in numbers less than 10(4) per ml. Hence many infections evade diagnosis. PCR is highly sensitive, but allows neither localization within tissues nor staging of mycobacterial disease, and positive findings frequently do not correlate with disease. In this study, an anti-Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Gurin polyclonal antiserum (pAbBCG) was used to improve immunostaining, which was compared to the ZN stain in histological samples. Screening of tissue samples including lungs, pleural lesions, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and skin for mycobacterial infection revealed that pAbBCG staining detects infected macrophages harbouring intracellular mycobacteria or mycobacterial material as well as free mycobacteria that are present at low abundance and not detected by the ZN stain. The positive pAbBCG staining results were confirmed either by PCR analysis of microdissected stained tissue or by culture from tissue. This immunostaining approach allows precise localization of the pathogen in infected tissue."

This requires movement of animals, which is inherent with disease risks, such as the introduction of pathogenic Mycobacterium sp. (MTBC) into a zoological collection. Decisions need to be made based on the outcome of perimovement disease screening using an array of tests, the majority of which are unvalidated in the species. A pair of endangered Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) imported from India to the United Kingdom were screened for MTBC using the comparative intradermal tuberculosis (TB) test, the feline interferon- blood test, and the experimental bacteriophage assay. Reactions on all three tests prompted screening of the three resident Asiatic lions using the same tests, all of which were negative for MTBC. Based on these test results, the decision had to be made to exclude the genetically valuable pair from the current collection. MTBC could not be identified using further tests, including culture and PCR on a bronchoalveolar lavage, on feces, or on postmortem tissues. This case series highlights the usefulness of a control group when interpreting unvalidated test results for detection of MTBC, the value of training big cats for conscious blood sampling, and the practical implications of placing the comparative intradermal TB test in the eyelids, when dealing with a species that requires a general anesthetic for most hands-on interventions."

Vgamma9/Vdelta2 lines were obtained by culturing CSF or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro with phosphoantigens and IL-2 for 2 months, and tested for proliferation and cytokine production in response to phosphoantigens. Vdelta2(D)Jdelta junctional sequence length was assessed by PCR. RESULTS: The repertoire of gammadelta T cells from the CSF of TBM patients was characterized by the predominance of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T lymphocytes, which accounted for >80% of gammadelta T cells. Vgamma9/Vdelta2 cells from the CSF of TBM children responded to different synthetic and natural (mycobacterial) phosphoantigens and produced discrete amounts of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The in vitro expansion of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells from CSF and peripheral blood of TBM patients prominently decreased following chemotherapy, and similarly, the proportion of ex vivo unstimulated Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells in CSF of TBM patients decreased to levels detected in the CSF of control subjects.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a IS6110-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method can be utilized to detect M. tuberculosis in non-pulmonary specimens. DESIGN: Specimens from 286 Mexican patients with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of EPTB were prospectively examined by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, mycobacterial culture on Lwenstein-Jensen slants, and by PCR. The DNA for PCR was extracted by the buffer lysis method and phenol-guanidine thiocyanate-chloroform. Primers that amplify a 200 bp fragment from the insertion-like M. tuberculosis sequence element IS6110 were utilized. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that this PCR method is highly specific (100%) for identifying M. tuberculosis from a variety of specimens including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, and lymph node exudate. Moreover, the sensitivity of PCR for detecting M. tuberculosis in CSF (94%), pleural fluid (94%), ascitic fluid and other extrapulmonary specimens (93%) greatly exceeds the sensitivity of conventional smear and culture methods.

We reviewed the records of 20 patients with pulmonary MAI infection (including 19 female patients) whose past history and previous chest radiographs revealed no predisposing lung disease. We analysed the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from these 20 patients and from six normal female controls. The BALF was recovered directly from the relevant segment that was identified with chest-computed tomography. The BALF cell profiles showed significantly elevated counts for total cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils, but the macrophage cell count was not elevated. The CD4+ lymphocyte count and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were significantly increased compared with those in the controls. The lymphocytes demonstrated phenotypical evidence of activation, with increased expression of human leukocyte antigen-D-related antigen (HLA-DR). The tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were significantly increased. The neutrophil elastase concentration was also increased, and it was significantly correlated with the neutrophil cell count in the BALF. These findings suggest that the increased counts of activated CD4+ lymphocytes and neutrophils and the elevated concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and neutrophil elastase appear to be common characteristics in Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection."

Therefore, 90 M. tuberculosis complex strains, originating from 38 countries, were tested in five restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing methods and in seven PCR-based assays. In all methods, one or more repetitive DNA elements were targeted. The strain typing and the DNA fingerprint analysis were performed in the laboratory most experienced in the respective method. To examine intralaboratory reproducibility, blinded duplicate samples were included. The specificities of the various methods were tested by inclusion of 10 non-M. tuberculosis complex strains. All five RFLP typing methods were highly reproducible. The reliability of the PCR-based methods was highest for the mixed-linker PCR, followed by variable numbers of tandem repeat (VNTR) typing and spoligotyping. In contrast, the double repetitive element PCR (DRE-PCR), IS6110 inverse PCR, IS6110 ampliprinting, and arbitrarily primed PCR (APPCR) typing were found to be poorly reproducible. The 90 strains were best discriminated by IS6110 RFLP typing, yielding 84 different banding patterns, followed by mixed-linker PCR (81 patterns), APPCR (71 patterns), RFLP using the polymorphic GC-rich sequence as a probe (70 patterns), DRE-PCR (63 patterns), spoligotyping (61 patterns), and VNTR typing (56 patterns). We conclude that for epidemiological investigations, strain differentiation by IS6110 RFLP or mixed-linker PCR are the methods of choice. A strong association was found between the results of different genetic markers, indicating a clonal population structure of M. tuberculosis strains. Several separate genotype families within the M. tuberculosis complex could be recognized on the basis of the genetic markers used."

TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta are thought to be involved in the immune response to mycobacterial infection. OBJECTIVE: To identify whether iNOS expression and cytokine release of PBM are upregulated and have a connection in TB infection. DESIGN: The expression of iNOS immunoreactivity on PBM from TB patients and normal subjects was measured by loading with anti-macrophage iNOS polyclonal primary antibody analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression of iNOS mRNA in PBM was detected by RT-PCR. The spontaneous generation of nitrite and cytokines (IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha) by cultured monocytes was also determined. RESULTS: Compared to normal subjects, iNOS immuno-reactivity, the capacity for spontaneous nitrite generation and the level of TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta secretion of PBM were significantly higher in TB patients. The amount of nitrite, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta released from PBM of TB patients was inhibited by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a competitive inhibitor of NOS. The level of iNOS immunoreactivity on PBM was highly correlated with nitrite generation both in all the subjects studied and in TB patients alone. Spontaneous TNF-alpha production showed a stronger correlation with nitrite production than with IL-1 beta. CONCLUSION: The NO and cytokine synthase activities of monocytes appear to be concomitantly upregulated in response to mycobacterial infection. The enhanced NO generation by monocytes in TB patients may play an autoregulatory role in amplifying the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines."

In this lecture, the recent advances in the basic studies on tuberculosis researches which were reported in Tuberculosis panel of the program were summarized. The host defence mechanisms against M. tuberculosis infection were the most important subject. The role of Th1-mediated cytokins such as IL-2, IFN gamma and TNF beta in the host-defence mechanism against mycobacterial infection was extensively discussed. Bcg gene of the mice is the example case for the genetic background of host against mycobacterial infection. The virulence factor, however of M. tuberculosis is still unknown. The technique of molecular biology was applied to the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The PCR and RFLP methods are the useful strategies for the rapid diagnosis and analysis of the mode of infection with M. tuberculosis. The development of detection techniques of drug-resistant tubercle bacilli is also urgently required. Another approach by molecular biology to tuberculosis research is the cloning of gene of tuberculin protein and the production recombinant protein of M. tuberculosis. The amino acid sequences of several proteins have been determined and their immunological properties of recombinant proteins were investigated. The immunological functions of lipid fractions of tubercle bacilli such as cord factor (TDM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) have been described. Especially the immunomodulating activities and the role of TDM as diagnostic antigen in the tuberculosis patients were described. The adjuvant activity of mycobacterial cell wall was well established and the minimum structural requirement was reported to be N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (MDP). The several MDP derivatives were selected as the cytokine inducers. Especially MDP-Lys (L18) was widely used as drug for the increasing the number of white blood cells and platelets in cancer patients. The effectiveness of MDP derivatives on the stimulating of mucosal immunity was also recently reported. The preventing activities of virus infection and cancer metastasis of MDP derivatives were shown in mice models."

The histopathological study clearly showed two phases of the disease. The first one was an acute phase which was characterized by inflammatory infiltrate in the alveolar capillary interstitium, blood vessel and bronchial wall with formation of granulomas. In this acute phase which lasted from 1 to 28 days, a clear predominance of Th1 cells was observed, manifested by a high percentage of interleukin-2 (IL-2) positive cells in the inflammatory infiltrate and granulomas demonstrated by immunohistology, as well as a gradual increment of interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) m-RNA. This was followed by a chronic or advanced phase characterized by pneumonia, focal necrosis and fibrosis, with a Th0 balance due to an equivalent proportion of IL-2 and IL-4 positive cells in the lung lesions, that coincided with the highest level of INF-gamma and IL-4 mRNA. The cytofluorometric analysis of bronchial lavage cells, showed a predominance of CD4 T cells during the acute phase and CD8 T lymphocytes in the chronic phase, gamma-delta T lymphocytes showed two peaks, at the beginning (3 days) and at the end (4 months) of the infection. These results suggest that T-lymphocyte subset kinetics and the pattern of cytokines produced in the lung during tuberculosis infection changed over time and correlate with the type and magnitude of tissue injury."

The frequencies of CC, CT and TT genotypes of ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphism were 34% (n = 42), 55% (n = 68) and 12% (n = 14), respectively. Contrary to the previous report, no association was found among these genotypes and plasma drug concentrations at weeks 6 and 12 of ART and after rifampicin discontinuation. We also observed no differences in CD4+ T cell recovery rate among different ABCB-1 C3435T genotypes.

The inefficiency of conventional laboratory methods and the reliance on pleural biopsy have motivated the evaluation of alternative diagnostic strategies. We have evaluated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) directed to the IS6110 sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the determination of adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity, and measurement of interferon (IFN)-gamma levels in pleural fluid in the diagnosis of pleural TB. PATIENTS: ADA activity, IFN-gamma levels, and PCR were evaluated in 140 cases of pleural effusion, 42 with confirmed pleural TB, 19 with probable pleural TB, 70 with a nontuberculous etiology, and 9 having an undetermined etiology. RESULTS: ADA activity, IFN-gamma levels, and PCR were 88%, 85.7%, and 73.8% sensitive, respectively, and 85.7%, 97.1%, and 90% specific, respectively, for pleural TB that had been confirmed by either culture or pleural biopsy specimens. The combination of PCR, IFN-gamma measurement, and ADA activity determination allowed the selective increase of sensitivity and specificity for probable and confirmed cases compared to individual methods. Positive and negative predictive values for these individual or combined methods were maintained over a wide range of prevalence of pleural TB in the patient population presenting with pleural effusions. Fever and younger age were associated with tuberculous pleural effusion (p < 0. 0001), while blood in sputum and older age were associated with malignant etiology (p < 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: These clinical variables together with the use of ADA activity determination, PCR, and measurement of IFN-gamma levels provide the basis for the rapid and efficient diagnosis of pleural TB in different clinical settings."

Although R-TB may be caused by relapse or exogenous reinfection, little is known about the underlying host responses associated with R-TB. This study investigated the profile of cytokines [interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10] present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 17 R-TB patients after stimulation with the 30-kDa antigen (Ag) or purified protein derivative (PPD) Ag of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These data were compared with data obtained from 15 patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB (N-TB), 22 patients with treatment failure (TF-TB), and 19 healthy tuberculin reactors (HTR). N-TB and R-TB patients were enrolled in this study within 1 month of beginning anti-tubercular chemotherapy. ELISA results showed that IFN-gamma production following stimulation with the 30-kDa Ag was significantly lower in each group of TB patients than in the HTR controls. In addition, patients with R-TB showed the most significant IL-12 depression among the subject groups after in vitro stimulation with either Ag. Furthermore, a significant decrease in TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels was observed in R-TB patients relative to N-TB patients. However, there was no statistical difference in TNF-alpha and IL-10 production between R-TB patients, TF-TB patients, and HTR controls. Our findings suggest that the underlying mechanisms of cytokine regulation might differ between N-TB and R-TB patients, and that decreased IL-12 production in response to the 30-kDa or PPD Ag might be involved in the immunopathogenesis of human R-TB."

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) constitutes the main cause of classic fever of unknown origin (FUO) in many populations. The aim of this study was to improve the diagnostic field of the disease using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, specific for the IS6110 insertion element of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, in order to achieve a more timely diagnosis and treatment. Setting. Twenty-four, HIV-negative classic FUO patients who were admitted to the Regional Hospital of Alexandroupolis between April 1997 and July 1999. Subjects and design. The above patients were considered as putative extrapulmonary TB after 3 weeks of in-patient investigation and underwent exhaustive examination for diagnosis of the disease. For this purpose, specimens were obtained from peripheral blood and bone marrow from these patients, as well as from damaged tissues, and analysed by both PCR and conventional methods. Anti-tuberculous treatment was initiated in 16 out of 24 patients and the response to this regimen was considered as the final criterion for diagnosis of tuberculosis. Results. Extrapulmonary TB was established in 11 patients. The PCR-based methodology, when applied to samples derived from bone marrow aspirations and suspected damaged tissues, was able to diagnose 10 of them, whereas the conventional methods were able to detect only two. Conclusions. Our results confirm the diagnostic value of molecular detection of M. tuberculosis in cases of FUO, thus supporting the application of PCR in tissue samples suspected of bacillus infection. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that bone marrow aspiration specimens constitute an alternative, easy, safe and reliable source for such PCR analysis."

Diagnosis may easily be missed when severe neurologic symptoms are the first clinical manifestation. A typical case of miliary tuberculosis is reported, with special regard to the problems of diagnostic work-up. The need for an early empirical therapy for suspected military tuberculosis is emphasized in particular.  Case Report: A 32-year-old Moroccan woman was admitted to the hospital with aphasia and a hemiparesis due to an intracerebral hemorrhage caused by a ruptured septic A. cerebri media aneurysm. Despite intensive work-up no septic focus could be found. Chest radiograph and computerized tomography (CT) showed miliary consolidations in the lungs. Skin testing (Tuberkulin Behring GT5) and smears for acid-fast bacilli and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for tuberculosis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were negative. A four-drug antituberculous regimen (rifampicin [RMP], isoniazid [INH], pyrazinamide [PZA], ethambutol [EMB]) was initiated, and resulted in normalization of temperature, blood pressure, and C-reactive protein. Subsequently, cultures of BAL yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient was discharged, a two-drug regimen was conducted (RMP, INH) after 2 months. Follow-up of the patient showed a significant improvement of the miliary lung consolidations after 5 months in CT of the lung. Only minor neurologic symptoms persisted after cessation of the therapy.  Conclusion: In developed countries, miliary tuberculosis is a very rare cause of septic infiltrative lung disease. However, due to the nonspecific nature of the presentation and despite improved diagnostic techniques, a high clinical suspicion is essential for successful treatment.  Urban & Vogel."

We used adoptive transfer of M. tuberculosis Ag85B-specific CD4(+) T cells to determine that the delayed adaptive response is caused by a delay in initial activation of CD4(+) T cells, which occurs earliest in the local lung-draining mediastinal lymph node. We also found that initial activation of Ag85B-specific T cells depends on production of antigen by bacteria in the lymph node, despite the presence of 100-fold more bacteria in the lungs. Although dendritic cells have been found to transport M. tuberculosis from the lungs to the local lymph node, airway administration of LPS did not accelerate transport of bacteria to the lymph node and did not accelerate activation of Ag85B-specific T cells. These results indicate that delayed initial activation of CD4(+) T cells in tuberculosis is caused by the presence of the bacteria in a compartment that cannot be mobilized from the lungs to the lymph node, where initial T cell activation occurs."

IFN-gamma increased the surface expression of class II molecules in THP-1 cells and this was markedly reduced in cells infected with M. tuberculosis. Despite this effect, steady state levels of HLA-DRalpha, HLA-DRbeta, and invariant (Ii) chains were equivalent in control and infected cells. Metabolic labeling combined with pulse-chase experiments and biochemical analysis showed that the majority of class II molecules in infected cells became resistant to endoglycosidase H, consistent with normal Golgi processing. However, results of intracellular staining and dual color confocal microscopy revealed a significant defect in transport of newly synthesized class II molecules through the endocytic compartment. Thus, compared with findings in control cells, class II molecules in infected cells colocalized to a minimal extent with a lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1+ endosomal compartment. In addition, in contrast to control cells, class II molecules in infected cells failed to colocalize with endocytosed BSA under conditions where this marker is known to label late endosomes, lysosomes, and the MHC class II compartment. Consistent with defective transport along the endocytic pathway, the maturation of SDS-stable class II alphabeta dimers--dependent upon removal of Ii chain and peptide loading of class II dimers in the MHC class II compartment--was markedly impaired in M. tuberculosis-infected cells. These findings indicate that defective transport and processing of class II molecules through the endosomal/lysosomal system is responsible for diminished cell surface expression of MHC class II molecules in cells infected with M. tuberculosis."

On presentation, routine blood tests and cultural examinations of sputum were carried out to detect common germs, fungi and TB bacteria (microscopic observation, cultivation and PCR), and a new antibiotic therapy (piperacillin/tazobactam) was started. Since the radiological picture appeared unchanged after 10 days of therapy and the examinations (microscopic observation and PCR) were negative, bronchoscopy with bacteriological evaluation of BAL was performed, which was positive to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and then tubercular lobitis was diagnosed. Therefore a specific therapy - rifampin (RMP), isoniazid (INH), etambutol (EMB), pyrazinamid (PZA) - was started and changed after 10 days due to the growth of mycobacteria resistant to INH and EMB on examination of sputum. Consequently, the early use of PCR on BAL allows, in skilled hands, small aspecific lobitis to be diagnosed more rapidly than using cultural examination of sputum."

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we have evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in adult patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative and new cases of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. We investigated the relationship between characteristic of the patients, radiological extension of the disease, sputum smear grade, presence of cavity, body-mass index (BMI), serum albumin level, total delay time and PCR positivity. Forty patients (33 male and 7 female; mean age 37.814.1) and 20 healthy control subjects (13 male and 7 female; mean age 35.67.3) were enrolled in this study. PCR was positive in 16 of 40 (40%) patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and negative in 24 of 40 (60%). None of the healthy controls had positive PCR results. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the PCR assay was 40,100 and 60%, respectively. We found the positive correlation between PCR positivity and sputum smear grade (r= 0.46, P=0.003), radiological extension of the disease (r= 0.69, P=0.001), presence of cavity (r= 0.90, P=0.001). We conclude that the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA from peripheral blood by PCR technique is useful for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis patients with HIV-negative. Hematogenous dissemination was important in tuberculosis patients and peripheral blood samples were suitable and easy materials. However, standardization of the PCR method must be ensured for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.  2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved."

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 33 patients with bone or joint TB concurrent with TB of other organs, especially the lung, who were admitted to our hospital between 1981 and 2005. The patients were divided into the following three groups according to the organ of concurrent TB : (1) miliary TB group (N = 10), (2) pulmonary TB group (N = 19), and (3) other TB site group (N = 4). The relationship between bone/joint TB and TB of other organs was studied by comparing the three groups with respect to the time of appearance of musculo-skeletal symptoms or signs such as swelling and pain and that of symptoms or signs originating from other organs, such as cough, sputum, miliary pattern on chest radiograph and superficial lymph node swelling. RESULTS: The mean age (SD) of patients was 50.5 (18.9) yr, and the male to female ratio was 23 : 10. Among 33 patients, bone TB (including 18 spinal TB) was detected in 24 patients, joint TB in 14, and abscess in 3 (concurrent lesions in some patients). The mean intervals from onset of symptoms to consultation (patients' delay), from consultation to diagnosis (doctors' delay) and from symptom onset to diagnosis (total delay) were 5.5 (13.9), 3.4 (5.2) and 8.9 (13.9) months, respectively. (1) Bone/joint TB concurrent with miliary TB (N = 10) In 8 patients with mean age of 61.0 (17.4) yr, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs preceded respiratory symptoms or appearance of miliary pattern on chest radiograph by 7.8 (7.2) (range; 1-24) months. The patients', doctors' and total delays were 0.4 (0.5), 7.3 (7.8), and 7.7 (7.6) months, respectively. In most cases, bone/joint TB was diagnosed after the onset of miliary pattern on chest radiograph. In one patient with simultaneous onset of musculo-skeletal and respiratory symptoms/signs (age 21 yr), the interval of total delay was 1 month, and in one patient with musculoskeletal symptoms which appeared six months later than respiratory symptoms (age 28 yr), the interval of total delay was 2 months. (2) Bone/joint TB concurrent with active pulmonary TB (N = 19). In this group, the mean age was 52.2 (17.1) yr, and males were predominant (M/F = 15/4). Active pulmonary TB was diagnosed by positive sputum culture in 13 patients, by positive sputum smear or PCR results in 4 patients, and by the clinical course in 2 patients. Ten patients (53%) had a previous TB history. Cavitary lesion was observed in 15 patients, and the upper lobes were predominantly involved on chest radiograph in 19 patients, indicating that the pulmonary TB was probably post-primary (reactivation) in all patients. In 9 patients with mean age of 49.7 (15.7) yr, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs preceded respiratory symptoms by 14.1 (14.0) (range; 4-48) months. The patients', doctors' and total delays were 13.3 (17.8), 3.8 (6.6), and 17.1 (16.1) months, respectively. On the other hand, in 10 patients with mean age of 54.5 (18.7) yr, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs and respiratory symptoms/signs appeared simultaneously, and the total delay was 2.7 (1.9) months. Twelve of 19 patients (63%) had complications such as diabetes mellitus, steroid use, and liver diseases. In cases with miliary or pulmonary tuberculosis, the total delay in diagnosis (Y) correlates positively with the time lag from onset of musculo-skeletal symptoms to respiratory symptoms/signs (X), and the regression line (Y = 0.94X + 2.3, r = 0.98, p < 0.001) was almost linear (Y = X), indicating that the diagnosis of bone/joint TB was made just after the diagnosis of miliary or pulmonary TB. (3) Bone/joint TB concurrent with TB of other sites (N = 4) In 2 female cases (21 and 28 yrs) with cervical lymph node TB, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs and cervical lymph node swelling appeared simultaneously. In a 54-yr male patient, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs appeared 5 years after appearance of testicular enlargement, and testicular TB was diagnosed by biopsy simultaneously. In a 33 year-old male patient, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs appeared 7 months after the drainage of pleural and pericardial effusions (TB was not diagnosed initially), and then the diagnosis of bone/joint, pleural, and pericardial tuberculosis was made for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged or elderly patients with active bone/joint TB, miliary TB is sometimes caused by bacillemia originating from the infected bone/joint lesions. In cases with bone/joint TB and concurrent pulmonary TB, bone/joint TB and pulmonary TB are probably reactivated independently as a result of decreased systemic immunocompetence."

To determine the local cytokine pattern of cells present (both endogenous and recruited) at the site of disease, we extracted RNA from skin biopsy specimens from patients with atopic dermatitis, allergic contract dermatitis, and positive tuberculin reactions and used PCR to assay for cytokine mRNA. cDNAs were normalized to the intensity of the CD3 delta PCR product as a marker of T cell mRNA. We found overexpression of IL-10 mRNA in atopic dermatitis lesions, in comparison with allergic contact dermatitis lesions and tuberculin reactions. In contrast, IL-4 mRNA was most strongly expressed in allergic contact dermatitis lesions and IFN-gamma mRNA was the predominant cytokine in tuberculin reactions. Using an anti-IL-10 mAb with immunoperoxidase, we localized IL-10 protein to large mononuclear cells in the dermal infiltrate of atopic lesions. After immunomagnetic sorting of mononuclear cell populations from PBMC of atopic dermatitis subjects, IL-10 mRNA as measured by PCR was found to be strongly expressed in CD14+ cells. Spontaneous release of IL-10 from PBMC-derived adherent cells was greater in atopic dermatitis donors than normal controls. We therefore renormalized skin biopsy cDNA according to the level of beta-actin PCR product, as a marker of total cellular mRNA, and found by PCR that IL-10 was nevertheless greatest in atopic dermatitis subjects. We conclude that the relative overexpression of IL-10 in atopic dermatitis greatest in atopic dermatitis subjects. We conclude that the relative overexpression of IL-10 in atopic dermatitis may contribute to the up-regulation of humoral responses and the down-regulation of Th1 responses."

Ninety children were examined before treatment. Twenty-five children (Group 1) were found to have single minor calcified masses in one group of intrathoracic lymph nodes or in the lung. Thirty-five children (Group 2) had multiple lymph nodes or foci in the lung in the phase of consolidation and calcification. Thirty children (Group 3, controls) were diagnosed as having intrathoracic tuberculosis in the phase of infiltration. The signs of the latent activity of tuberculosis were detected in all the children of all three groups, being more pronounced in Group 3. Thus, MBT and TAb were revealed in 90% of the children in Group 3 and in 52.9 and 76.0% in Groups 1 and 2, respectively.

There were signs of intoxication in 80 and 88% and a hyperergic Mantoux reaction in 44.0 and 43.3%, respectively. The frequency of the signs of activity did not greatly differ. Thus, children with newly diagnosed respiratory tuberculosis in the phase of calcification should be regarded as having the signs of tuberculosis activity, followed up as Group I patients, and prescribed chemotherapy for 3-6 months or more, depending on the extent of the process."

We evaluated clinical characteristics of 14 patients with the CNS tuberculosis (10 male and 4 female, 21 to 71 years of age) who were hospitalized at IMCJ from 1988 to 1997. Twelve patients had tuberculous meningitis (2 of them had also intracranial tuberculoma), 1 had intracranial tuberculoma and 1 had spinal cord tuberculosis. For the acid-fast bacilli, the smears of cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) were all negative but the cultures for M. tuberculosis were positive in 5. Using PCR method, M. tuberculosis was identified from CSF specimens in 2 out of 9 culture negative patients, thus suggesting the usefulness of the PCR for the rapid diagnosis of CNS tuberculosis. The adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in CSF may provide another diagnostic clue because they were elevated in 8 out of 10 cases. It is to be noted that there were three patients who developed clinical manifestations of CNS tuberculosis after the initiation of chemotherapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. In the last five cases, four-drug regimen which included PZA, was used with a good result. The success could be related to the addition of PZA which penetrates blood-brain barrier just as good as INH. Two patients died and one remains unconscious with severe neurological sequelae. The present study indicates that positive CSF culture, hydrocephalus and consciousness disturbance are important factors in determining poor prognosis of the CNS tuberculosis."

Physical examination, chest radiography, serologic testing, microscopy, M. tuberculosis-specific interferon  enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, smear and culture of synovial fluid for acid-fast bacilli, and PCR. Diagnosis. The patient's assayed blood and synovial fluid lymphocytes were reactive, and the numbers of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells, as determined by ELISPOT, were twofold to sixfold higher in synovial fluid than in blood. Cultures for acid-fast bacilli remained negative, while PCR specific for DNA of the M. tuberculosis complex was positive in synovial fluid cells. These results suggested that the patient had either active or latent M. tuberculosis infection. This finding, coupled with the presence of polyarthritis, led to a diagnosis of Poncet disease. Management. Standard antituberculous therapy consisting of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide was given for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 4 months. Inflamed joints were treated with methylprednisolone injections. The polyarthritis resolved within 4 months of initiating antituberculous therapy."

Besides it, test can lack both sensitivity and specificity depending on the interpretation and the site of the PPD inoculation. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the use of the Gamma-Interferon (IFN) assay as a confirmatory test in Brazil. A Comparative Intradermal Tuberculin Test (CITT) was performed in 50 cows from a dairy herd known to be infected with TB. Blood samples for IFN testing were collected concurrent with the CITT, as well as seven and 21 days later. At 30 days after the CITT, all cattle deemed reactive to this test were slaughtered and samples were processed by both bacteriological culture and PCR. The sensitivity of IFN as a diagnostic tool was 91.4%, whereas specificity was 86.7%. When applied seven or 21 days after injection of PPD, sensitivity was 74.3 and 71.4%, respectively, whereas specificity was 86.7 and 80%. There was no significant difference between the reliability of the IFN assay and the other standards, on all three days of sampling.

However, these investigations are intended for primary tuberculosis infection. The majority of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis cases in the elderly are thought to be caused by reactivation. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were (1) to examine the efficacy of fine needle aspiration cytology, polymerase chain reaction and blood tests in the diagnosis of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis caused by reactivation, and (2) to clarify any differences when compared with primarily infected cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three elderly patients with neck lumps underwent excisional biopsy from 2003 to 2008. The efficacy of fine needle aspiration cytology was examined by comparing the results of excisional biopsy with those of fine needle aspiration cytology performed at the initial medical examination for cases of suspected tuberculous disease. Furthermore, the leucocyte count and C-reactive protein concentration were compared for cases of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis versus cases of malignant lymphoma. RESULTS: Although nine cases were diagnosed with cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis using excisional biopsy, only one of these had been suspected based on fine needle aspiration cytology results. Three cases with tuberculous lymphadenitis were suspected of having malignant lymphoma on initial examination. There was no significant difference in the leucocyte count and C-reactive protein concentration, comparing cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis versus malignant lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Unlike the primary infection often seen in endemic areas, the diagnosis of early stage tuberculous lymphadenitis of the swelling type caused by reactivation in elderly people is difficult to confirm unless excisional biopsy is performed. In elderly patients with neck lumps, cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis should be included in the differential diagnosis."

The studies have shown that it is expedient to concurrently determine MBT DNA and MBT AT in order to identify local forms of tuberculosis in children from risk groups. If the tests are positive, a comprehensive examination for tuberculosis is required; the presence of the syndrome of common disturbances is generally associated with tuberculous infection. When a local form of tuberculosis is excluded, preventive chemotherapy should be performed. Further negative tests for MBT DNA and lower MBT AT may be a criterion for the efficiency of preventive treatment. In children with tuberculosis, the results of repeated blood and urine tests for MBT DNA provide a way of evaluating the course of a tuberculous process and the efficiency of chemotherapy. PCR used to determine blood and urine MBT DNA is a highly specific test as positive results were in 79% of the children with tuberculosis."

Two mouse models deficient in CD4 T cells were used to examine the mechanism by which these cells participate in protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge. Transgenic mice deficient in either MHC class II or CD4 molecules demonstrated increased susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, compared with wild-type mice. MHC class II-/- mice were more susceptible than CD4-/- mice, as measured by survival following M. tuberculosis challenge, but the relative resistance of CD4-/- mice did not appear to be due to increased numbers of CD4-8- (double-negative) T cells. Analysis of in vivo IFN-gamma production in the lungs of infected mice revealed that both mutant mouse strains were only transiently impaired in their ability to produce IFN-gamma following infection. At 2 wk postinfection, IFN-gamma production, assessed by RT-PCR and intracellular cytokine staining, in the mutant mice was reduced by >50% compared with that in wild-type mice. However, by 4 wk postinfection, both mutant and wild-type mice had similar levels of IFN-gamma mRNA and protein production. In CD4 T cell-deficient mice, IFN-gamma production was due to CD8 T cells. Thus, the importance of IFN-gamma production by CD4 T cells appears to be early in infection, lending support to the hypothesis that early events in M. tuberculosis infection are crucial determinants of the course of infection."

The IS1245 RFLP and PFGE analyses showed a 96.8% diversity of the M. avium strains from the 93 patients. The vast majority (95.2%) of infections were monoclonal, indicating that recent infection is unlikely, even at an advanced stage of AIDS. For one patient, sequential isolates gave divergent patterns of sensitivity and resistance to clarithromycin, but all were identified as the initial clone. RFLP analysis and PCR typing of single colonies allowed for the detection of three polyclonal infections during the bacteriological follow-up. Among strains from patients whose samples were positive by culture after treatment for 2 to 15 months, 97.4% were the same as the initial strain. In conclusion, relapses and failures were mostly due to the initial strain. These relapses and failures resulted either from the selection of resistant mutants or the reappearance of sensitive strains, suggesting the persistence of nonsterilized tissue reservoirs."

Several studies have already reported that tuberculous pleurisy is a T-helper type 1(Th1)-dominant disease. In this study, we sought to examine the Th1/T-helper type 2 (Th2) balance, especially focusing on the polarizing status of T-cells to Th1/Th2 in malignant pleural effusions by measuring cytokines in pleural effusions and by evaluating the polarizing status of T-cells on the point of stimulation with interleukin (IL)-12 and/or IL-18. Furthermore, we evaluated inhibitors of interferon (IFN)-gamma production in effusions to rule out the possibility of direct inhibition of T-cell polarization. PATIENTS: Effusion samples were collected from 19 patients with malignant pleurisy caused by lung cancer and from 7 patients with tuberculous pleurisy. MEASUREMENTS: Concentrations of pleural fluid IFN-gamma, IL-12, and IL-4 were measured. IFN-gamma production of T-cells enriched from malignant pleural effusions in the presence of IL-12 and/or IL-18 was also examined. We further compared the inhibitory activity of malignant pleural effusions against IFN-gamma production and analyzed the expression of T-cell immunoglobulin mucin, mucin domain (Tim-3), a Th1-specific molecule in pleural fluid T-cells. RESULTS: Although malignant pleural effusions showed low levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines and ratios of IFN-gamma and IL-12 to IL-4 were low, isolated T-cells produced a significant level of IFN-gamma in the presence of IL-12 and IL-18. Soluble factors were not found to inhibit IFN-gamma production in malignant pleural effusions. In tuberculous pleural effusion, ratios of IFN-gamma and IL-12 to IL-4 were significantly higher, and T-cells showed the expression of Tim-3 messenger RNA. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that T-cells in the malignant pleural effusions are mainly nave or not definitely polarized to Th1. Moreover, malignant tumor does not actively distort the cytokine condition through production of soluble inhibitors within effusions. The present study indicates that antitumor immunity may be enhanced by restored IFN-gamma activity through combination of IL-12 and IL-18, and that it will lead to new therapies for malignant effusion."

All smear positive samples were PCR positive except for 7/138 (5.07%) that were false negative because of the presence of inhibitors. However, the use of several samples for each patient minimize the false negative results. The PCR allowed the detection of more positive results in smear negative sputa from HIV- (50%) than in HIV+ patients (20.5%). In contrast, in smear negative blood samples, PCR was positive more frequently in HIV+ (30%) than in HIV- patients (12.5%). Regarding patients, 15/25 HIV+ and 13/17 HIV-patients had at least one positive sample with PCR whereas only 7/25 and 11/17 respectively for HIV+ and HIV- patients had smear positive samples.

RT-PCR demonstrated that Rv3425 mRNA is expressed in liquid culture by M. tuberculosis H37Rv. When tested in a conventional ELISA in the form of a His-tagged recombinant protein, Rv3425 revealed a statistically significant antigenic distinction between healthy bacille Calmette-Gurin (BCG)-vaccinated controls and tuberculosis (TB) patients (p <0.0001). The anti-IgG response to recombinant Rv3425 was almost equal to that for CFP-10, and was higher than that for ESAT-6.

The spectrum of disease includes acute and chronic respiratory illness. As a result of the HIV epidemic currently occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-associated acute and chronic respiratory disease has emerged as a major factor in the epidemiology of childhood respiratory illness. Pneumonia is the leading causes of childhood mortality responsible for approximately 21% of deaths in African children under five years of age each year. The HIV pandemic has increased the incidence, severity and pneumonia mortality in African children. Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of morbidity and death. Globally, the highest TB incidence rates occur in sub-Saharan African countries; many of these countries are also experiencing a dual HIV epidemic, resulting in an exponential increase in TB cases. The burden of childhood respiratory illness has necessitated novel and improved ways of diagnosis, treatment and prevention, particularly in the context of limited resources. Improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention of pneumonia have been a research focus, particularly in HIV-infected children. African studies have provided information on the epidemiology, aetiology and outcome from pneumonia in HIV-infected and uninfected children. The efficacy of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis in reducing mortality and morbidity in HIV-infected African children was shown in the only randomized controlled trial. Two large studies have shown the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in an African context. Regarding TB, areas of research include diagnostic studies and improved preventative strategies. Promising diagnostic studies for childhood TB include the use of sputum induction, PCR techniques and blood interferon assays. The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has emerged as a new clinical entity in HIV-infected children with TB associated with use of antiretroviral therapy. New preventative strategies for TB include novel vaccines and primary prophylaxis. Available, effective interventions for prevention and treatment of childhood respiratory disease exist; the challenge is to achieve widespread implementation and high coverage rates in African countries. Greater access to newer vaccines and, in HIV-infected children, to anti-retroviral therapy and prophylaxis is necessary to further reduce the burden of childhood respiratory illness in Africa.  2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, an open biopsy 2 years and 7 months before death showed a polymorphic appearance with abundant T-lymphocytes. Most of the EBV-infected atypical lymphocytes did not express either B- or T-cell markers as far as examined in the paraffin-embedded biopsy specimen, and rearrangements of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptors were not found. It seemed difficult to diagnose a B-cell lymphoma at the time of biopsy. However, retrospectively considered, if a phenotype of EBV-infected atypical lymphocytes is uncertain in cases showing polymorphic appearance, it might be better to consider the future evolution to overt B-cell lymphoma. Since pyothorax-associated lymphoma shows latency III infection of EBV, at least the immunohistochemistry of EBNA-2 and LMP-1 seems helpful for the diagnosis to prove which cells are infected by EBV."

The response has been quite well investigated in the experimental models, however, there is little information about certain cytokine levels in patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The shortage of data pertains also to its most common form-kidney tuberculosis, especially when bacilli dissemination into the blood circulation has occurred. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to examine simultaneously the frequency of Mycobacterium tuberculosis presence in the blood circulation and the serum cytokine concentration during kidney tuberculosis to approach their relationship in the clinical infection process. It is considered that cytokine levels do not correlate with localisation of tuberculosis (pulmonary vs. extrapulmonary), however, there is little information about the cytokine levels in patients with kidney tuberculosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 30 patients attending the urology clinic with suspicion of kidney tuberculosis were evaluated. Serum concentrations of selected cytokines in patients with urine, urine and blood Mycobacterium tuberculosis presence were quantified by ELISA and compared to PCR negative patient and group of healthy people. RESULTS: Our study demonstrates the increase of TNF-alpha and IL-12 level in comparison to control group. TNF-alpha concentration was about 2-fold higher in the positive patients than it was in control group; IL-12 concentration was about 4-fold higher and the differences between IL-12 levels were statistically important (p < 0.05). However, no significant differences were found in IFN-gamma level among all groups. Using Spearman correlation rank test, a significant correlation was found between TNF-alpha and IL-12 in the positive patient group. The correlation factor was more significant for the group of patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis present in blood and urine than it was in urine positive PCR group (r = -0.66 vs. r = -0.51)."

At present, the diagnosis of CNS tuberculosis remains a complex issue because the most widely used conventional ""gold standard"" based on bacteriological detection methods, such as direct smear and culture identification, cannot rapidly detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.Tb) bacilli in CSF specimens with sufficient sensitivity in the acute phase of TBM. Recently, instead of the conventional ""gold standard"", the various molecular-based methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, has emerged as a promising new method for the diagnosis of TBM. Moreover, nested PCR assay has been reported as a key method that drastically increases the sensitivity and specificity of DNA amplification compared with conventional single-step PCR. Currently, a novel assay technique, which is internally controlled and combines the high sensitivity of nested PCR with the accurate quantification of real-time PCR, namely, Wide Range Quantitative Nested Real-time PCR (WR-QNRT-PCR) assay, has been developed. This novel assay technique is useful for the rapid diagnosis and the assessment of anti-tuberculosis treatment during clinical course of TBM. Therefore, in actual clinical practice, its wider use for diagnosis of TBM is expected in the future."

This infection causes disseminated disease, is difficult to diagnose, and is of serious concern because it causes significant mortality in birds. A new method was developed for processing specimens for an antemortem screening test for ATB. This novel method uses the zwitterionic detergent C18-carboxypropylbetaine (CB-18). Blood, bone marrow, bursa, and fecal specimens from 28 ducks and swabs of 20 lesions were processed with CB-18 for analysis by smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Postmortem examination confirmed nine of these birds as either positive or highly suspect for disseminated disease. The sensitivities of smear, culture, and PCR, relative to postmortem analysis and independent of specimen type, were 44.4%, 88.9%, and 100%, respectively, and the specificities were 84.2%, 57.9%, and 15.8%, respectively. Reductions in specificity were due primarily to results among fecal specimens. However, these results were clustered among a subset of birds, suggesting that these tests actually identified birds in early stages of the disease. Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping identified one strain of M. avium (serotype 1) that was isolated from lesions, bursa, bone marrow, blood, and feces of all but three of the culture-positive birds. In birds with confirmed disease, blood had the lowest sensitivity and the highest specificity by all diagnostic methods. Swabs of lesions provided the highest sensitivity by smear and culture (33.3% and 77.8%, respectively), whereas fecal specimens had the highest sensitivity by PCR (77.8%). The results of this study indicate that processing fecal specimens with CB-18, followed by PCR analysis, may provide a valuable first step for monitoring the presence of ATB in birds."

In tuberculosis patients, IFN-gamma production by Mycobacterium tuberculosis-stimulated PBMC was reduced, the percentages of T cells expressing IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2 were significantly decreased, and IL-12R beta 2 mRNA expression was also markedly reduced. In contrast, in pleural fluid and lymph nodes at the site of disease in tuberculosis patients, in which IFN-gamma production is enhanced, IL-12R beta 2 mRNA expression was also increased. In M. tuberculosis-stimulated peripheral blood T cells from tuberculosis patients, anti-IL-10 and anti-TGF-beta enhanced IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2 expression, and IFN-gamma production. In M. tuberculosis-stimulated peripheral blood T cells from healthy tuberculin reactors, recombinant IL-10 and TGF-beta reduced IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2 expression, as well as IFN-gamma production. In combination with prior studies showing increased production of TGF-beta by blood monocytes from tuberculosis patients, this suggests that increased TGF-beta production is the underlying abnormality that reduces IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2 expression in tuberculosis. Our findings provide evidence that IL-12R expression correlates well with IFN-gamma production in human tuberculosis, and that expression of IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2 may play a central role in mediating a protective Th1 response."

We describe a case in which tuberculosis was diagnosed after admission to the ICU following three months of treatment at various health facilities. CASE REPORT: A 13-yr-old boy was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory distress due to a right-sided multi-focal pneumonia, pleural effusion, and mediastinitis. He also had acute renal failure and was in shock. He had been treated for three months with various antibiotics. A skin TB-test was negative, as were blood and sputum cultures. Mediastinoscopy revealed enlarged lymph nodes in the anterior and posterior mediastinum and in the right pulmonary hilus. A lymphoma was suspected and steroids were commenced.The boy was critically ill, requiring mechanical ventilation (PIP 46 cm H2O, PEEP +7), extensive inotropic support and fluid resuscitation. By using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on material from a bronchial lavage, infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was revealed, and anti-TB multi drug treatment was instituted (oral pyrazinamide, ethambutol, isoniazide and iv rifampicin). The oral treatment was complicated by dysenteric diarrhea, so enteral drugs were stopped and streptomycin instituted. Intravenous isoniazide was reinstituted later because of TB-meningitis. The treatment resulted in steady improvement and the boy was discharged from the ICU after 6 weeks of treatment. Six months later he was discharged home in a satisfactory condition, without signs of neurological damage. CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis can be very difficult to diagnose and may lead to multiple organ failure. PCR tests of specimens taken from affected body areas, should be made as early as possible."

The combination of PCR and direct stain achieved a sensitivity similar to that of culture alone. The PCR method detected 74 of 95 (78%) culture-positive results. In a hospital setting, PCR could be a useful, reliable tool for diagnosis of tuberculosis and may be introduced as a complementary routine diagnostic laboratory method."

METHODS: The specimens of sputum and peripheral blood from 168 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, 57 patients with lung cancer and the specimens of peripheral blood from 34 healthy individuals were detected by TaqMan-PCR, PCR. The specimens of sputum were also detected by smear, culture with BACTEC and Lowenstein-Jensen for comparison. RESULTS: The positive rates of sputum and peripheral blood detected by TaqMan-PCR were 53.0% and 61.3%, respectively, significantly higher than those of PCR, smear, culture with BACTEC and Lowenstein-Jensen (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between TaqMan-PCR and PCR for specificity (P > 0.05). Of 105 specimens of peripheral blood from patients with smear-negative and culture-negative pulmonary tuberculosis, 48 specimens of peripheral blood detected by TaqMan-PCR were positive. The positive rate was 45.7%. CONCLUSIONS: TaqMan-PCR method showed higher sensitivity and specificity. It is an useful tool for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly smear-negative and culture-negative pulmonary tuberculosis."

The patient presented with signs of infection, although the fever disappeared temporarily after successive treatments for malaria (confirmed Plasmodium faiciparum), as well as neurological signs with left hemiparesis. Chest radiographs showed no signs of progressive pulmonary tuberculosis, and blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid testing, and HIV serology were all negative. Treatments for maxillary sinusitis, the malaria, bacterial meningitis, and cerebral abscess were equally ineffective. Brain stem tuberculoma was diagnosed only when the patient was transferred to a hospital equipped with neuroimaging equipment and was confirmed after histopathological examination of the intracranial lesion biopsies and the detection of mycobacterium DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the cerebrospinal fluid. A review of 147 cases of intracranial tuberculoma reported in Africa between 1985 and 2001 points out the difficulties of both the differential diagnosis (tuberculoma or other intracranial space-occupying lesions) and treatment in African areas where neuroimaging is unavailable. Our patient's brainstem tuberculoma probably resulted from reactivation of latent tuberculosis."

Bacterial CFU was reduced to less than 1/100 in the lung and to about 1/10 in the spleen relative to the same combined DNA vaccine without IL-2. The lungs of this group of mice showed much less damage due to an influx of epithelioid macrophages and less lymphocytes. RT-PCR showed that antigen genes could be detected in more organs and for a longer period of time when treated with combined DNA vaccine formulated in IL-2. We suggest that IL-2 enhanced the immunigencity and protective efficacy in immunized mice by improving the Th1-type response and also by prolonging the antigen gene expression in different organs."

Wide-spread use of nucleic acid amplification for rapid detection of tubercle bacillus contributed more greatly than any other factor to such advances in this field. At present, 90% of all kits used for nucleic acid amplification in the world are consumed in Japan. Unfortunately, not a few clinicians in Japan have a false idea that the smear method and nucleic acid amplification are necessary but culture is not. In any event nucleic acid amplification has exerted significant impacts on the routine works at bacteriology laboratories. Among others, collecting bacteria by pretreatment with NALC-NaOH has simplified the introduction of the collective mode smear method and liquid media. Furthermore, as clinicians have become increasingly more experienced with various methods of molecular biology, it now seems possible to apply these techniques for detection of genes encoding drug resistance and for utilization of molecular epidemiology in routine laboratory works. Meanwhile, attempts to diagnose acid-fast bacteriosis by checking blood for antibody have also been made, primarily in Japan. At present, two kits for detecting antibodies to glycolipids (LAM, TDM, etc.) are covered by national health insurance in Japan. We have an impression that in Japan clinicians do not have adequate knowledge and skill to make full use of these new testing methods clinically. We, as the chairmen of this symposium, hope that this symposium will help clinicians increase their skill related to new testing methods, eventually leading to stimulation of advances in clinical practices related to acid-fast bacteria in Japan. 1. Smear microscopy by concentration method and broth culture system: Kazunari TSUYUGUCHI (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center) Smear microscopy and culture still remain the cornerstone to diagnose tuberculosis. However, the classical methods in Japan using direct microscopy and Ogawa solid media were not sufficient for clinical use. In recent years substantial advance has been made in these fields. Concentration of clinical samples by centrifugation improves the sensitivity of smear microscopy with excellent reproducibility. The Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) system using liquid media yields high sensitivity and rapidity. Using these methods, more and more tuberculosis cases would be correctly diagnosed and treated adequately based on drug susceptibility testing. 2. New technologies for anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing: Satoshi MITARAI (Bacteriology Division, Reference Centre for Mycobacterium, Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association) Several new technologies have been developed to obtain anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing (AST) results rapidly, utilising liquid culture and molecular technologies. Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT), as a popular liquid culturing and AST system, was evaluated for its accuracy and usefulness. As for isoniazid, MGIT showed 12.6% of discordant result comparing with standard method. These MGIT resistant and Ogawa susceptible strains had relatively high MICs ranging 0.13 to 2.0 microg/ml. The molecular detection of resistant gene mutation is also a useful method to estimate drug resistance rapidly. The rpoB mutation detection is reliable with high sensitivity and specificity. 3. Nucleic acid amplification and novel diagnostic methods: Shunji TAKAKURA (Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine) Sensitivities of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis meet clinical requirement that patients with high-risk of transmission should be identified within a day. Comparison of the performance of various NAATs is difficult because of the difference in sample processing and in samples tested among methods and reports. Considering the limitations of NAATs (low sensitivity compared with culture, inability to differentiate dead bacilli from the living), further advances would be expected when novel technologies could confer additional information, such as drug susceptibility, quantity, viability, and genotype. 4. Serodiagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease: Seigo KITADA (Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Toneyama National Hospital) Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) organisms are ubiquitous in environment and a contamination in respiratory tracts is sometimes observed, and that complex the diagnosis. We developed a serodiagnostic method for MAC disease using an enzyme immunoassay with the MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid (GPL) core as antigen. A significant increase in GPL core antibodies was detected in sera of patients with MAC pulmonary diseases compared to patients who were colonized with MAC, patients with M. kansasii disease and tuberculosis and healthy subjects. The serodiagnosis is useful for diagnosis of MAC lung disease. 5. Molecular epidemiologic tools for tuberculosis: IS6110 RFLP, Spoligotyping, and VNTR: Tomoshige MATSUMOTO, Hiromi ANO, Tetsuya TAKASHIMA, Izuo TSUYUGUCHI (Osaka Prefectural Medical Center for Respiratory and Allergic Diseases) We have performed molecular typing on about 1,300 culture positive clinical isolates that made up the majority of tuberculosis strains in part of southeast Osaka since 2001 until now. By spoligotyping, about 75% of entire strains belonged to the Beijing strain. Particular spoligotyping descriptions, which were not described in SpolDBIII, were found in the strains with lower than 6 copies of IS6110 RFLP. We described them as Osaka type. We could also show that direct typing from Tb PCR positive sputum of patients with tuberculosis was possible by VNTR and that VNTR with 16 loci was useful in tuberculosis typing in Osaka."

Furthermore, it results in a major public health problem when transmitted to humans. Due to its difficult and non-specific diagnosis, M. bovis has been declared to be one of the etiologic agents causing significant economic loss in the cattle industry. Our group evaluated a more rapid and specific method, based on a new polymerase chain reaction species-specific primers, which amplifies a 470-base pair fragment of the M. bovis genome. A total of 275 milk-producing cows were studied by intradermal tuberculin test (ITT) which gave 184 positive and 91 negative cases. From them, 50 animals were taken from a cattle ranch free of tuberculosis. Three different samples were collected from each animal (blood, nasal mucus, and milk). Positive results were obtained from 26 animals by PCR (11.4%), 1 by bacteriological culturing (0.4%) and 1 by bacilloscopy (0.4%). This finding suggests, as in previous reports, that ITT, normally used for bovine tuberculosis detection, has the inconvenience of having a broad range of specificity and sensitivity, and the PCR technique is a more specific and sensitive test to detect infection associated with M. bovis. Therefore, we propose this PCR assay as a useful tool in the epidemiological characterization of infected animals in areas considered to be at high risk of transmission."

Increased production of calcitriol by activated macrophages has been shown to be the cause in most cases. In this article, we describe three cases of hypercalcemia associated with inappropriately elevated calcitriol levels and suppressed PTH in hemodialysis. In addition to conventional techniques for tuberculosis diagnosis we used Ligase Chain Reaction (LCR) to detect mycobacterial DNA in pleural effusion with acid-fast stain and culture negativity. Antituberculous therapy was associated with a decrease in the levels of calcium, as well as in serum calcitriol concentrations, and a substantial increase in the levels of iPTH. The serum levels of 25(OH)D3 remained unchanged. These findings suggested ectopic production of calcitriol. The discussion reviews the previously reported cases of hypercalcemia and tuberculosis that occurred during hemodialysis, and concludes that ectopic production of calcitriol by tuberculous granulomas is extremely unusual and its demonstration requires a high index of suspicion. Molecular techniques are a potentially useful approach for early and rapid diagnosis of tuberculous infection in dialysis patients."

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from deer infected with Mycobacterium bovis or vaccinated with live or killed M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) were cultured with mycobacterial antigens. IL-4 mRNA production was assayed using the polymerase chain reaction. Elevated levels of IL-4 mRNA were detected in response to at least one antigen preparation in all animals infected with M. bovis as compared with none of the non-infected control animals. After a primary immunization, elevated levels of IL-4 mRNA were detected in only a proportion of vaccinated animals and this did not correlate with whether the vaccine was live BCG or killed BCG in oil. After boosting, all the animals vaccinated with killed BCG in oil exhibited elevated IL-4 mRNA production whereas none of the animals vaccinated with live BCG showed elevated levels. The data suggest that IL-4 is turned off during the immune response to live BCG, that boosting of low-dose live BCG vaccine may be required to 'imprint' this signal and that this may be important in the development of protective immunity to tuberculosis. Killed BCG in adjuvant is not protective and as with experimental infection with virulent M. bovis it failed to switch off the IL-4 response. IL-4 may be useful as a diagnostic tool and as an in vitro marker of vaccine efficacy."

Based on the diagnosis of acute pneumonia and ARDS, intravenous administration of sivelestat sodium hydrate (100 mg/day), and continuous infusion of hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) were started. PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved but X-ray findings showed no improvement and a blood test revealed pancytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed necrotizing epithelioid granuloma and acid-fast bacilli.

Therefore, we diagnosed miliary tuberculosis and transferred the patient to an infectious disease hospital. Miliary tuberculosis complicated with ARDS is relatively rare and the prognosis is extremely poor. Miliary tuberculosis should be kept in mind as a cause of ARDS."

OBJECTIVE: To study the cell-mediated immune responses (CMI) in vitro by assessing skin test conversion, lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine patterns before and after BCG vaccination in 20 Mantoux negative subjects, and to compare this with that of 20 naturally Mantoux positive subjects. DESIGN: In vitro lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine responses to various mycobacterial antigens were studied in 12 subjects from each group. The cytokines interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 were measured by both reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: All of those who were initially Mantoux negative but one subject converted to positivity following vaccination, confirming that BCG vaccination does cause skin test conversion. However, in vitro proliferative responses to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), purified protein derivative (PPD) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis remained largely unaltered by vaccination. The production of IFN-gamma was significantly higher in PPD-positive individuals compared to the PPD-negative group, and BCG vaccination of the latter did not change the levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that PPD-negative individuals did not produce IFN-gamma even following vaccination and skin test conversion suggests that BCG had little effect in driving the immune response towards a protective Th1 type."

We incubated the PBMCs with PPD in the presence or absence of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I or class II antibody in vitro, and measured the VEGF levels of culture supernatants. We also analysed the source of cells that secrete VEGF by using flow cytometry with intracellular staining. The T lymphocytes of active tuberculous patients secreted a higher level of VEGF than those of healthy controls. This production of VEGF was inhibited by adding MHC class II antibody. The addition of MHC class I antibody, however, did not inhibit. We propose that CD4+ T lymphocytes are almost certainly the cells that produce VEGF in response to PPD.

Pulmonary tuberculosis and intracranial tuberculomas were suspected and bacterial cultures, PCR, smear examination of sputum, blood, CSF, gastric juice, and urine were repeated. But no evidence of tuberculosis was obtained. Follow-up CT after 5 days of admission showed exacerbation of intracranial lesions. Finally, the open brain biopsy was carefully done from the right occipital lesion. The histological examination disclosed a typical pathology of tuberculoma and PCR also turned out to be positive from the brain tissue. We diagnosed him as intracranial tuberculoma and anti-tuberculous drugs(isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide) were administered. After 30 days under the medication, brain CT demonstrated a transient expansion of the intracranial lesions. While the same therapy was sustained, intracranial lesions gradually decreased and he discharged after 60 days of admission. Brain CT is known as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of intracranial tuberculoma. Its sensitivity is almost 100%, but some clinical reports have described that its specificity is not always so high(20-71%) as expected. In addition, it should be recognized that intracranial tuberculoma might show 'paradoxical expansion'. It is a phenomenon, which shows a paradoxical worsening in clinical aspect despite of the appropriate therapy. In such a progressing case as ours, it is desirable to make a definite diagnosis before anti-tuberculous drug is started. Therefore, it is recommended in possible cases to even consider the open brain biopsy from the early period when intracranial tuberculoma is highly suspected."

However, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) DNA was detected in CSF by PCR amplification, and he recovered completely with anti-tuberculous treatment. This case was interesting to reveal atypical features of spontaneous recovery. Since Shankar's study using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of M. tuberculosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the PCR assay have been recognized to be a rapid method for diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM). But there are problems of PCR sensitivity when dealing with CSF samples containing small amount of M. tuberculosis DNA. Comparing direct PCR with nested PCR, we studied on the evaluation of PCR for diagnosis of TBM. In this study the nested PCR was positive in all CSF specimens from 4 patients with TBM, but we could not detect M. tuberculosis DNA by only the direct PCR.

While inflammatory findings were noticed, the cause was not identified by blood and imaging examinations (thoracoabdominal CT, etc.). Although her tuberculin reaction was positive, symptoms indicative of pulmonary tuberculosis were absent. Administration of Cefotiam and Imipenem Cilastatin sodium was ineffective. Pyometra was diagnosed. After drainage, the uterine cavity was washed every day. On the basis of culture of fluid retained a few colonies of Gram-negative bacteria were isolated, but were not identified, Cefpirome was administered, whereupon the fever subsided gradually, but mild inflammatory findings remained. Even after discharge on July 24, the retention increased, so drainage and washing were done repeatedly. However, mild inflammatory findings persisted. She began to have a fever from September 17 and was readmitted. After admission, administration of Flomoxef sodium was started, but no improvement was seen. A small amount of hydrothorax appeared on the left. Thoracocentesis yielded a bloody, slightly turbid exudative. Acid-fast staining and Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific PCR of pleural effusion were negative, but adenosindeaminase was 87.4 U/l. Therefore, a diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy was made. DNA/PCR of tubercle bacilli in the fluid retained in the uterus was positive, and re-retention was prevented by administration of anti-tuberculosis drugs. These findings suggest a strong possibility of tubercle bacillus having been the causative bacteria. Particularly in the case of the elderly, it appears important that pyometra be included in differential diagnosis as the cause of fever even without gynecological symptoms and that tubercle bacillus be considered the causative bacterium."

Continuous treatment with 5 mm or 10 mm l-N6-(1-imino-ethyl)-lysine (L-NIL), a selective NOS2-inhibitor, in acidified drinking water for up to 7 weeks consistently reduced infection-induced nitrate/nitrite to background levels in mycobacteria-infected BALB/c mice. Oral treatment with 5 mm L-NIL initiated at the time of infection significantly exacerbated growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but had no effect on Mycobacterium avium colony-forming unit development in the liver, spleen and lungs of intravenously infected mice. In order to examine the role of nitric oxide in mycobacteria-induced granulomatous inflammation in the absence of any effect on the bacterial load, M. avium-infected mice were treated with 5 mm L-NIL from day 1 through 38 and the development of granulomatous lesions in the liver was assessed by histology, immunohistology and reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Computer- and video-assisted morphometry performed at 4 and 7 weeks post-infection showed that treatment with L-NIL led to markedly increased number, cellularity and size of granulomatous lesions in infected mice regardless of the virulence of the M. avium isolate used for infection. Immunohistology of the liver revealed that in mice treated with L-NIL, the numbers of CD3+ T cells, CD21/35+ B cells, CD11b+ macrophages and RB6-8C5+ granulocytes associated with granulomatous lesions was increased. RT-PCR of the liver showed that in L-NIL-treated mice infected with M. avium, mRNA levels of tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-12p40, interferon-gamma, interleukin-10 and interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) were up-regulated, while mRNA levels of interleukin-4, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and MCP-5 were similar to those in untreated control infected mice. When M. avium-infected mice were treated with 5 mm L-NIL between the 5th and 12th weeks of infection, similar changes in granuloma number and size were found in the absence of any effect on the bacterial load. These findings demonstrate that nitric oxide regulates the number, size and cellular composition of M. avium-induced granulomas independently of antibacterial effects by modulating the cytokine profile within infected tissues."

In the other cases, the MTD false positives may be accounted for the presence of previous M. tuberculosis infection, the influence of anti-tuberculous medication and so on, and the MTD false negatives are most likely due to the presence of inhibitors (blood, for example) or to the small number of organisms in the specimens. It can be concluded that adequate samples should be obtained, and that MTD should be repeated in case of discrepant results."

Because the serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2 R) level was unexpectedly high (> 8,000 U/ml), and a level not previously reported in benign diseases, we performed thoracoscopy- and mediastinoscopy-assisted biopsies, both of which eventually confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

HIV-1 replication was enhanced both in the cellular (pleural compared with blood mononuclear cells) and acellular (pleural fluid compared with plasma) compartments of the pleural space. Several potential mechanisms for expansion of HIV-1 in situ were found, including augmentation in expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and the HIV-1 noninhibitory beta-chemokine (MCP-1), low presence of HIV-1 inhibitory beta-chemokines (MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and RANTES [regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted]), and upregulation in expression of the HIV-1 coreceptor, CCR5, by pleural fluid mononuclear cells. Thus, at sites of MTB infection, conditions are propitious both for transcriptional activation of HIV-1 in latently infected mononuclear cells, and facilitation of viral infection of newly recruited cells. These mechanisms may contribute to enhanced viral burden and dissemination during TB infection."

The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) gene promoter -308 G>A (rs1800629) region, interferon gamma (IFN-) gene +874 T>A (rs61923114) region, interleukin (IL)-12B p40 gene 1188 A>C (rs3212227) region, IL-10 gene promoter -1082 G>A (rs1800896) region and IL-4 gene promoter -590 C>T (rs2243250) region. A total of 84 patients (71 male, 13 female; mean age: 32.57  15.94 years) whose clinical samples yielded M.tuberculosis complex growth, and 110 healthy blood donors (93 male, 17 female; mean age: 29.40  11.56 years) as control group were included in this study. Of the patients, 76 (90.5%) were diagnosed as pulmonary and 8 (9.5%) as extrapulmonary TB. While 79 (94.1%) patients were newly diagnosed as TB, 5 (5.9%) patients had a TB history (relapsed TB). It was detected that acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were positive in 58 (69%) patients. According to the single nucleotide polymorphism results, gene frequencies could not be compared for TNF-a gene promoter -308 G>A region since healthy controls were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium while the patients were not. There were no statistically significant differences in allele and genotype distribution between the patients and healthy controls in IFN- gene +874 T>A region, IL-12B p40 gene 1188 A>C region, IL-10 gene promoter -1082 G>A region and IL-4 gene promoter -590 C>T region (p> 0.05). There were also no statistically significant differences between AFB positive (n= 58) and negative (n= 26) patients, and AFB positive (n= 56) and negative (n= 20) pulmonary TB patients (p> 0.05). In conclusion, no statistically significant differences were found associated with the susceptibility or resistance to TB with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene regions responsible for cytokine production in the study population. Only some of the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene regions responsible for cytokine release were investigated in our study. Therefore further detailed studies to investigate the polymorphisms in the genes that control the cytokine release and receptors specific for these cytokines, should be conducted. Although this study was performed in a relatively small sized population, these findings might provide a significant contribution to the epidemiologic data about the molecular immunology of TB in Turkey."

How the immune system regulates individual T cells that display very different reactivity to antigen remains unclear. Here we found that activated CD4(+) T cells, at the peak of clonal expansion, persistently downregulated their TCR expression in proportion to the strength of the initial antigen recognition. This programmed response increased the threshold for cytokine production and recall proliferation in a clone-specific manner and ultimately excluded clones with the highest antigen reactivity. Thus, programmed downregulation of TCR expression represents a negative feedback mechanism for constraining T cell effector function with a suitable time delay to thereby allow pathogen control while avoiding excess inflammatory damage."

Our data indicated that DC-SIGN knockdown alone in DCs did not affect the maturation or the immunological function of lipopolysacharide (LPS)-activated DCs. Surface molecules were dramatically down-regulated in DCs primed with manLAM but not in mock control DCs (P<0.05). Meanwhile, manLAM enhanced the production of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 in DCs (P<0.05). The level of IFN- was significantly down-regulated in the supernatants of naive T cells after co-cultured with DCs primed with manLAM (P<0.05). We demonstrated that DCs primed with manLAM may partially impair maturation phenotypes and immune response in LPS-activated DCs. However, the alterations of DCs function and downstream immune response caused by manLAM were reversed by the knockdown of DC-SIGN."

CircRNA expression profiles were screened by circRNA microarrays in active TB plasma samples. Dysregulated circRNAs were then verified by qRT-PCR. CircRNA targets were predicted based on analysis of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction. GO and KEGG pathway analyses were used to predict the function of circRNA. ROC curve was calculated to evaluate diagnostic value for active TB. A total of 75 circRNAs were significantly dysregulated in active TB plasma.

It is more common among immunosupressed patients such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive ones. In this report we present a case with C. neoformans meningitis and miliary pulmonary infiltrates suggesting pulmonary tuberculosis without HIV infection. A-70-years-old male was admitted to the hospital with mental confusion, 3-weeks history of headache, weight loss, dry cough and fatigue. Physical examination was normal except neck stiffness. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white cell count was 120/mm3 (80% polimorphonuclear cells). Gram staining of CSF revealed poorly stained gram-positive yeast cells. Empirical therapy with lipozomal amphotericin B, ceftriaxone and ampicillin combination was started. When C. neoformans growth was detected on CSF culture, ceftriaxone and ampicillin were discontinued. Patient became conscious at 24th hour of the treatment. Peripheric blood flow-cytometric analysis revealed a significant decrease in absolute CD4+ T lymphocytes, and in CD8+28+ T lymphocytes in addition a significant increase in natural killer cell ratio. Blood immunoglobulin and complement levels were found normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomogralphy (CT) of the abdomen were normal, however, chest CT revealed multiple parenchymal millimetric nodular infiltrations on both sides and minimal fibrotic alterations. Acid-fast staining of CSF, tuberculosis culture, tuberculosis PCR results and repeated HIV serology were found negative. Despite the lack of microbiological confirmation, empirical antituberculosis treatment was also started with the suspicion of miliary tuberculosis as the patient had a symptom of long-term dry cough, miliary infiltrations on chest CT, anergic tuberculin skin test and a history of pulmonary tuberculosis in childhood. After two weeks, amphotericin B was changed to oral fluconazole which was continued for an additional eight weeks. Antituberculosis therapy was given for nine months. Control chest CT taken after four months of antituberculosis therapy revealed improvement of the lesions. This presentation emphasizes the fact that cryptococcal infections may develop in HIV negative patients, even together with tuberculosis in certain cases and radiological findings of the two infections may be confusing when both of them invade the lungs."

Puncture of the accumulated fluid around the pancreas led to the diagnosis 'tuberculosis' (infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Once the patient had made a good recovery with antituberculosis therapy, antiretroviral therapy was initiated, whereupon the number of CD4+ cells in the blood increased. Extrapulmonal tuberculosis is not unusual in HIV seropositive patients from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. However, in such patients isolated tuberculosis of the pancreas is unusual and has not previously been described in the Netherlands. The diagnosis can be established following a CT guided puncture; tuberculosis is instantly suspected if the Ziehl-Neelsen stains are positive and the diagnosis can then be confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and by culturing. Anti-retroviral therapy is withheld until response to anti-tuberculosis treatment is satisfactory."

In situ hybridization, immunohistochemical, and RT-PCR techniques were used. Cytokine mRNAs showed a biphasic pattern. The percentage of mononuclear cells (MN) containing IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, and IL-8 mRNAs was highest in 1- to 3-day lesions, apparently because of the nonspecific inflammatory response caused by the tubercle bacilli in the BCG vaccine. At 5 days, this percentage was significantly reduced. With IFN-gamma, the peak and trough were delayed by 2 days. By 9 days, the percentage of MN containing the mRNAs of all five cytokines had again increased and the rabbits had become tuberculin-positive. In general, MCP-1 and TNF-alpha proteins and the vascular adhesion molecules, ICAM, VCAM, and perhaps ELAM, peaked at about 3 days. Many mononuclear cells surrounding the central areas of solid and liquefied caseous necrosis contained chemokine IL-8 mRNA. IL-8 is known to attract PMN, and PMN were present nearby. In contrast, MN containing chemokine MCP-1 mRNA were present more peripherally in areas rich in macrophages and lymphocytes. The early nonspecific cytokine response seems to be an adjuvant effect of the mycobacteria in BCG vaccine in that it causes a rapid entry of macrophages, lymphocytes, granulocytes, and probably dendritic cells into local sites of antigen deposition. This effect should be considered in developing improved vaccines for the prevention of tuberculosis, because BCG vaccines producing a strong early cytokine response should be more immunogenic than BCG vaccines with similar antigens producing a weak response."

METHODS: HLptn cDNA of tissues from six cases with normal kidneys and ten cases with tuberculous kidneys was amplified by RT-PCR. The RT-PCR products were separated with 2% of gel. The cDNA was cloned to vector pGM-T Easy and was completely sequenced. The immunohistochemical staining method was used to examine the expression of lymphotactin in normal kidneys and tuberculous kidneys and the expression of CD4 and CD8 in tuberculous kidneys. RESULTS: The sequence of cloned hLptn cDNA was confirmed and it was identical with the sequence of NO.U23772 published in GenBank. Both normal kidneys and tuberculous kidneys expressed hLptn mRNA. HLptn was detected not only in the cells of normal renal glomerulus and renal tubule but also in the cells of remaining renal glomerulus and renal tubule of tuberculous kidneys. The cells expressing surface antigens CD4 and CD8 scattered in granulomas. CONCLUSION: The constructive expression of hLptn is in the cells of renal glomerulus and renal tubule of normal kidney and tuberculous kidney. The accumulation of CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells in granulomas may not depend on hLptn.

Tuberculosis was the second most frequently identified cause, after HSV and with the same number of cases as VZV. The authors report the specific features of patients presenting with tuberculosis encephalitis (TE). METHODS: TE patients were defined as patients presenting with encephalitis, with positive culture or PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, or the association of clinical, biological, imaging, and epidemiological evidence (possible cases). Clinical, microbiological, and brain imaging data was analyzed and compared to that of other included patients. RESULTS: Twenty cases of TE were identified. The M/F sex-ratio was 1.5, the mean age 53 years. Four (20%) patients had a history of tuberculosis before the encephalitis. The median delay between the onset of general and neurological symptoms was significantly longer for tuberculosis cases than for others (10 days vs. 2; P<10(-10)). The median CSF protein level was significantly higher for tuberculosis cases (2.1 g/L vs. 0.8 g/L, P=0.002). CT scan and MRI were normal on admission for eight patients out of 17. Fourteen isolated strains of M. tuberculosis were susceptible to first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs and one was rifampicin-resistant. Six (33%) patients died during hospitalization and two were lost to follow-up. Ten out of 12 (78.6%) had persisting neurological symptoms on discharge. DISCUSSION: Despite non-multiresistant MT strains, the case fatality rate among TE patients was high in our series. Early brain imaging is poor contributive for the diagnosis of TE."

Tuberculosis (TB) is diagnosed both early and late during the course of HIV-1 disease and may increase diversity of HIV-1 quasispecies by activating the HIV-1 immune response and increasing HIV-1 replication. We examined whether HIV-1 heterogeneity is altered in HIV-1-infected individuals with TB. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from 7 HIV-1-infected patients with active TB (HIV/TB patients) and 9 HIV-1-infected patients (HIV patients) in Kampala, Uganda (CD4 counts of 0-650 cells/microl and HIV loads of 700-750,000 RNA copies/ml). The C2-C3 region of the HIV-1 envelope gene (env) was amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from lysed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of each patient, and then subject to sequencing, clonal-quasispecies analysis and heteroduplex tracking analysis (HTA). RESULTS: HTA of env DNA fragments showed increased heterogeneity in the HIV/TB individuals compared with the HIV group. Further sequence and HTA analysis on ten individual env clones for each patient showed significantly greater HIV mutation frequencies in HIV/TB patients than in HIV patients. CONCLUSION: An increase in HIV-1 heterogeneity may be associated with a TB-mediated increase in HIV-1 replication. However, a diverse HIV-1 quasispecies population in HIV/TB patients as opposed to tight quasispecies clusters in HIV patients suggests a possible dissemination of lung-derived HIV-1 isolates from the TB-affected organ."

Methods: Adults with proven or suspected meningitis were enrolled in this prospective study. Laboratory tests: Full blood count, blood chemistry, and HIV tests were performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was submitted for routine microbiology, chemistry (glucose, protein), and hematology testing. When classical microbiology analyses were negative, a broad-range bacterial polymerase chain reaction (BRBPCR) was used. Results and conclusions: Of the 276 patients enrolled, 215 (77.9%) were HIV positive. In HIV-positive patients cryptococcal meningitis (CM) was the most common cause of meningitis (39.1%) followed by pyogenic meningitis (PM) (30.7%), mononuclear meningitis (MM) (28.8%), and tuberculous meningitis (TM) (1.4%). In HIV-negative patients, PM was the most common cause (60.7%) followed by MM (37.7%) and CM (1.6%, one case). In-hospital mortality was higher in HIV-positive patients (73/128 = 57%) compared to those HIV negative (3/18 = 16.7%) (p = 0.001). Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 26) was the most common bacterial diagnosis, mainly in HIV-positive patients (n = 22, 10.2%). Meningococcal meningitis (14 Neisseria meningitidis of group A and one W135) was diagnosed in nine (4.2%) HIV-positive and six (9.8%) HIV-negative patients. Gram-negative rods were isolated from five HIV-positive and two HIV-negative patients, respectively. The bacteria and fungi involved in meningitis did not display high levels of in vitro resistance. Conventional microbiology techniques failed to detect the causative agent in 55 (53.4%) PM cases. Broad-range bacterial PCR detected DNA from S. pneumoniae in three samples, N. meningitidis in two, Escherichia coli in one, Listeria monocytogenes in two and Staphylococcus aureus in one sample. In the CSF of five (three HIV negative and two HIV positive), PCR products were not identified with the oligonucleotide probes specific for the usual species of bacteria found in CSF, or genera commonly considered potential contaminants of clinical samples. Among the MM cases, 77 (90.5%) probable viral meningitis (54 HIV positive and 23 HIV negative) and eight TM (HIV positive) were suspected.  2006 International Society for Infectious Diseases."

Polymorphism at the genetic locus of a drug and xenobiotic compound metabolizing enzyme, N-acetyltransferase type 2 (NAT2), is reported to be associated with the excess generation of toxic reactive metabolites. Polymorphisms at the glutathione S-transferase (GST) loci (GSTM1 and GSTT1) are involved in the detoxification of these toxic metabolites in the human body to a lesser extent. We have examined whether polymorphisms at these loci are associated with the risk of ATD-induced hepatotoxicity. METHODS: In this case-control study, 33 pulmonary tuberculosis patients with ATD-induced hepatotoxicity and 33 pulmonary tuberculosis patients receiving ATD drugs without any evidence of hepatotoxicity were considered as cases and controls, respectively. Point mutations at NAT2 and homozygous 'null' mutations at GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes were looked into genomic DNA, isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The frequency of homozygous 'null' mutation at the GSTM1 gene was significantly higher among cases (n = 17, 52%) than controls (n = 8, 24%) (P < 0.05, relative risk 2.13, 95% CI: 1.25-3.10). Frequencies of mutations at GSTT1 and NAT2 genes did not differ significantly between cases and controls. CONCLUSION: Homozygous 'null' mutation at the GSTM1 gene might predispose an individual to ATD-induced hepatotoxicity."

The JRA group was not Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccinated whilst the majority of the RA group was. As determined by immunoblotting, 79% of sera from patients with JRA reacted mainly with a 18.6-kDa protein (P18.6), whilst 70% of sera from patients with RA reacted mainly with a 30-kDa protein (P30) of BCG, M. tuberculosis and M. kansasii. In contrast, only a moderate proportion of the control sera (25% of adult and 20% of children) showed reactivity to P30, and none of the samples had significant reactivity with the P18.6 antigen. Furthermore, T-cell proliferation to the P18.6 and P30 antigens was detected in the majority of JRA and RA patients, and was nearly always higher in synovial fluid (SF) than in the peripheral blood (PB). We also investigated the usage of V beta family genes in P18.6 and P30 antigen-specific T-cell lines established from the SF of one patient with active RA. We showed that V beta 2, -4, -5, -6, -7, -14, -17, -18 and V beta 19 were over-represented compared with other known V beta families. We also noted that the proportion of V beta 14 was higher in freshly isolated SF mononuclear cells compared with the blood in this patient and in 2 out of 4 other RA patients examined. Other V beta families such as V beta 6, V beta 8, V beta 16, V beta 18 and V beta 19 were also over-represented in the SF compared with the blood in some patients. Taken together our results provide more information concerning the role of mycobacterial antigens in RA and suggest that there may be an in vivo clonal expansion of T lymphocytes in the synovium."

Of this population, 12 were men, 5, women; ages ranged from 23 to 75 years (mean, 46.9). There were three HIV positive patients among them. More than a half of patients had disturbance of consciousness as initial symptom. Neurological signs were variable such as visual acuity loss, hemiparesis, paraparesis, cerebellar ataxia, and tremor, though disturbance of consciousness was the most frequent (36%). Neuroimaging (X-ray CT and MRI) revealed meningeal enhancement (53%), tuberculoma (50%), hydrocephalus, infarction or bleeding and spinal cord tuberculoma. There were three patients who showed paradoxical progression. Eleven patients were performed CSF examination, all of them revealed increased cell count (mean, 206 counts/mm3) and protein (mean, 225 mg/dl), but only 4 patients were positive on bacteriological examination including PCR. Seven patients died and 5 patients were performed autopsy. Neuropathologically, all patients showed a stage of meningitis prominent on basal brain (basal cistern and/or Sylvian fissure). Cell infiltrations including lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinocyte were most severe around blood vessels, and observed in all cases except one which showed only fibroblast and collagen fibers indicating healed stage. In some cases, there existed epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells, and in some cases, fibrin exudate. There were three cases having tuberculoma, one HIV case and two non-HIV cases. Center of tuberculoma in non-HIV case was formed by caseous necrosis, and tuberculoma was surrounded by granuloma constituted by epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells with lymphocyte cell infiltration and proliferation of blood vessels. In contrast, tuberculoma of HIV case did not include granuloma, and was formed with small cells with large nucleus which surrounded arteries. Our studies, as other studies, failed to show any differences between HIV and non-HIV patients clinically, as well as on neuroimaging study. But neuropathological study suggests that mechanism of tuberculoma formation may be different between in HIV positive patients and in non-HIV patients."

The DNA methylation represents avery stable sign and therefore may be used as avaluable marker for cancer screening. Epigenetic cancer biomarkers are independent of classical morphology and thus show extensive potential to overcome the limitations of cytology. Several epigenetic cancer markers have been reported to be detectable in body fluids such as bronchial aspirate, sputum, plasma and serum.Short stature homeobox gene 2 (SHOX2) encodes ahomeo-domain transcription factor, which has been identified as aclose homologue of the SHOX gene and both genes are involved in skeletogenesis and heart development. Methylation of SHOX2 gene has been shown to be present at high prevalence in carcinomas of lung, however may also be used to identify other tumour entities.In the presented study, we have compared suitability of two types of material associated with lung cancer for the detection of SHOX2 methylation. We have confirmed that methylation of SHOX2 gene represents reliable marker of lung malignancies. The parallel tests in the blood plasma revealed that it may represent agood alternative material for testing of the SHOX2 methylation, making the test available to patients who are unable to undergo bronchoscopy."

SUMMARY ANSWER: Women with latent GTB have lower ovarian reserves and yield lower numbers of oocytes in IVF. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Limited evidence suggests that women with GTB may have a low ovarian reserve. Infertile women have a high incidence of latent GTB and treatment improves fertility outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective study from February 2013 to January 2016 compared 431 infertile women diagnosed with latent GTB (Group I) to 453 infertile women without latent GTB (Group II). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study was conducted at Shreyas Hospital, Kolhapur, India, a tertiary referral centre for infertility. Women of both groups were 21-38 years of age. Group I consisted of infertile women with proven tubal patency but with latent GTB diagnosed by DNA PCR testing of an endometrial biopsy. Day 2-4 anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC) were assessed in both groups. All women with latent GTB took antituberculosis therapy (ATT). Gonadotropin dosages and oocyte and embryo details were noted in both groups for those who underwent IVF. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Women with latent GTB were younger (29.8  4.4 years vs. 30.8  4.5 years; P = 0.003) and, following adjustment for age, had significantly lower AMH [Median (IQR): 2 (0.9, 4.1) ng/ml vs 2.8 (1.3, 5) ng/ml; P = 0.01] and AFC [Median (IQR): 7 (5, 11) vs 8 (5, 14); P < 0.001]. Post ATT, women with latent GTB yielded fewer oocytes (9.3  7.6 vs. 10.9  8.1; P = 0.01), but had more grade I embryos transferred (1.1  0.5 vs. 0.89  1.0; P = 0.001) and a better implantation rate (26.8% vs. 17.5%; P = 0.004) in IVF compared to women in Group II. Group I had a higher pregnancy rate compared to Group II (51.6% vs. 40.5%; P = 0.001), through various treatment modalities. Considering the adequacy of the sample size and use of robust ovarian reserve markers, the role of chance is minimal. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: The study is limited to an infertile population visiting a tertiary referral centre. The mechanisms by which latent GTB infection would lead to ovarian damage are unclear. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: It is believed that latent GTB is without any clinical significance. However, a low ovarian reserve in young women with latent GTB necessitates considering it as a cause of infertility, in women with prolonged infertility. These women may experience an accelerated decline in ovarian reserve with reduced success in achieving biological parenthood. Clinicians must be aware of this condition and its consequences while managing infertility.

Here reported are 2 cases of acute meningoencephalitis with history of blood transfusion and travel to southeast Asia; both are positive for screening tests of human immunodeficiency virus infection. One of the pathogen causing central nervous system infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was identified by polymerase chain reaction; the other left undiagnosed. It is known that patients of human immunodeficiency virus infection or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome can present with acute central nervous system infection.

In order to observe whether a strain isolated from a wild boar, previously tested as highly virulent in a mice model, is also virulent in cattle, we performed cattle experimental inoculation with this strain RESULTS: Groups of Friesian calves were either infected with the wild boar strain M. bovis 04-303 or with the bovine strain NCTC10772 as a control. We found that antigen-specific IFN- release in whole blood samples occurred earlier in animals infected with M. bovis 04-303. Both M. bovis strains resulted in a positive skin test, with animals infected with the wild boar isolate showing a stronger response. These results and the presence of more severe organ lesions, with granuloma and pneumonic areas in cattle demonstrate that the wild boar isolate is more virulent than the NCTC10772 strain. Additionally, we tested the infectivity of the M. bovis strains in guinea pigs and found that M. bovis 04-303 had the highest pathogenicity. CONCLUSIONS: M. bovis strains isolated from wild boars may be pathogenic for cattle, producing TB lesions."

Quantitative PCR is the method of choice for measuring the expression levels of microRNAs. However, a major obstacle that affects the reliability of results is the lack of validated reference controls for data normalization. Various non-coding RNAs have previously been used as reference controls, but their use may lead to variations and lack of comparability of microRNA data among the studies. Despite the growing number of studies investigating microRNA profiles to discriminate between healthy and disease stages, robust reference controls for data normalization have so far not been established. In the present article, we provide an overview of different reference controls used in various diseases, and highlight the urgent need for the identification of suitable reference controls to produce reliable data. Our analysis shows, among others, that RNU6 is not an ideal normalizer in studies using patient material from different diseases.

Livers of mice infected with TMC 724 were characterized by progressively expanding tumor-like infiltrations of epithelioid macrophages, while SE 01 induced well-developed, compact epithelioid granulomas that remained constant in size and number for at least 4 months. When C57BL/6 mice were depleted of CD4+ T cells by i.p. administration of specific mAb at the time of infection, their capacity to initiate granuloma formation was completely abrogated during the first 4 weeks of infection. Semi-quantitative competitive RT-PCR of liver homogenates obtained 3 weeks after infection revealed that depletion of CD4+ T cells was accompanied by a 25-fold reduced expression of IFN-gamma mRNA and a 5-fold reduced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA when compared to control infected mice. Granuloma morphology in response to either TMC 724 or SE 01 was similar in immunodeficient SCID mice to that observed in syngeneic BALB/c mice. However, SCID mice developed granulomas in a delayed fashion and were less efficient in surrounding infected Kupffer cells with an inflammatory infiltration. The delayed kinetics of granuloma initiation in infected SCID mice was paralleled by a lower mRNA expression for IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha compared to that observed in infected BALB/c mice. mAb-mediated neutralization of IFN-gamma in BALB/c mice significantly reduced inflammatory infiltrations and granuloma formation. These data support the conclusion that CD4+ T cells accelerate granuloma formation by enhancing the production of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma at the site of infection."

IL-3 stimulates the proliferation, differentiation and survival of pluripotent stem cells. IL-17 has shown to promote inflammatory cell recruitment and granuloma organization throughout infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. During the chronic phase of the infection, a balance between Th1 and Th17 responses needs to be achieved to limit immunopathology. AIM: To correlate the serum levels of IL-3 and IL-17 at presentation and after completion of treatment in clinicoradiologically proven cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis. METHODS: 32 clinicoradiologically confirmed cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis were included. Archived serum samples of eight patients of osteoarticular tuberculosis of an earlier study, confirmed by PCR, AFB smear or by histopathology with previously determined IL-12 and TGF-beta levels were available. A detailed history was noted and their general physical, local and relevant systemic examination was performed. Various laboratory parameters including TL-3 and IL-17 levels in serum were estimated at presentation and at six months of DOTS CAT-1 treatment. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in the clinical and radiological parameters after treatment. No correlation was found between IL-3 and IL-17 levels before and after treatment. A significant correlation (p value= 0.022) was shown between levels of IL-3 and IL-12 after six months of treatment.

Previous research has shown that the intramuscular immunization of BALB/c mice with a naked plasmid DNA fragment encoding the Mycobacterium leprae 65-kDa heat-shock protein (pcDNA3-Hsp65) induces protection against M. tuberculosis challenge. A key stage in the protective immune response after immunization is the generation of memory T cells. Previously, we have shown that B cells capture plasmid DNA-Hsp65 and thereby modulate the formation of CD8+ memory T cells after M. tuberculosis challenge in mice. Therefore, clarifying how B cells act as part of the protective immune response after DNA immunization is important for the development of more-effective vaccines. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by which B cells modulate memory T cells after DNA-Hsp65 immunization.

Thirty days after immunization, the percentages of effector memory T (TEM) cells (CD4+ and CD8+/CD44high/CD62Llow) and memory CD8+ T cells (CD8+/CD44high/CD62Llow/CD127+) were measured with flow cytometry. Interferon , interleukin 12 (IL-12), and IL-10 mRNAs were also quantified in whole spleen cells and purified B cells (CD43-) with real-time qPCR. Our data suggest that a B-cell subpopulation expressing IL-10 downregulated proinflammatory cytokine expression in the spleen, increasing the survival of CD4+ TEM cells and CD8+ TEM/CD127+ cells."

METHODS: Anticoagulated peripheral blood was collected from patients with active tuberculosis, latent tuberculosis infection subjects and HCs. Monocytes were isolated and purified from the peripheral blood. Fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the mRNA level of Blimp-1 in monocytes. After the monocytes from HCs were stimulated with whole cell lysate of H37Rv MTB and peptide pool of ESAT-6/CFP-10, respectively, the level of Blimp-1 mRNA was again detected by fluorescence quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The level of Blimp-1 mRNA in the monocytes from patients with active tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection subjects were significantly lower than that from HCs. Compared with the unstimulated monocytes, the level of Blimp-1 mRNA in the monocytes stimulated with whole cell lysate of H37Rv MTB significantly decreased, while the expression of Blimp-1 mRNA in the monocytes stimulated with ESAT-6/CFP-10 was not significantly changed.

However, vaccines encoding single antigens of mycobacterium did not produce protective effect as BCG did. In the present study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a divalent DNA vaccine encoding two immunodominant antigens Ag85B and MPT64 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We found that both humoral and Th1-type (high IFN-gamma, low IL-4) cellular responses obtained from the divalent DNA vaccine group were significantly higher than that conferred by BCG. RT-PCR results showed that antigens were expressed differentially in various organs in divalent DNA vaccine group. The survival rate for mice treated with the divalent DNA vaccine after challenging with high doses of virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv was significantly higher than that of the BCG group or any of the single DNA vaccine group. Significant differences were also found between the single and divalent DNA vaccinated mice in terms of body, spleen and lung weight. Bacterial loading decreased about 2000-fold in lungs and about 100-fold in spleens of divalent DNA vaccinated mice when compared with that of the control group.

The numbers of GT repeats were determined by PCR and gene scans for 176 TB patients and 196 controls. The recombinant TLR2 promoter/exonI/exonII/intronII/luciferase constructs including three representative repeats: (GT)13, (GT)20, and (GT)24 were transfected into K562 cells, and luciferase activities were estimated and compared. The expression of TLR2 on CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers were measured with flow cytometry. Genotypes with shorter GT repeats were more common among TB patients (49.4 vs 37.7%, P=0.02). This observation was confirmed among 82 other TB patients as a validation cohort. Shorter GT repeats were associated with weaker promoter activities and lower TLR2 expression on CD14+ PBMCs. In conclusion, the development of TB disease in Koreans was associated with shorter GT repeats in intron II of the TLR2 gene. This association is correlated with lower expression of TLR2 through weaker promoter activity for genes with shorter GT repeats."

Prospective head-to-head comparisons of their diagnostic accuracy in real-world settings are necessary to assess their clinical use. We aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of candidate transcriptional signatures identified by systematic review, in a setting with a high burden of tuberculosis and HIV. METHODS: We did a prospective observational study nested within a diagnostic accuracy study of sputum Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra) tests for pulmonary tuberculosis. We recruited consecutive symptomatic adults aged 18 years or older self-presenting to a tuberculosis clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. Participants provided blood for RNA sequencing, and sputum samples for liquid culture and molecular testing using Xpert and Ultra. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of candidate blood transcriptional signatures for active tuberculosis (including those intended to distinguish active tuberculosis from other diseases) identified by systematic review, compared with culture or Xpert MTB/RIF positivity as the standard reference. In our primary analysis, patients with tuberculosis were defined as those with either a positive liquid culture or Xpert result. Patients with missing blood RNA or sputum results were excluded. Our primary objective was to benchmark the diagnostic accuracy of candidate transcriptional signatures against the WHO target product profile (TPP) for a tuberculosis triage test. FINDINGS: Between Feb 12, 2016, and July 18, 2017, we obtained paired sputum and RNA sequencing data from 181 participants, 54 (30%) of whom had confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Of 27 eligible signatures identified by systematic review, four achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy with similar area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (Sweeney3: 906% [95% CI 856-956]; Kaforou25: 869% [809-929]; Roe3: 869% [803-935]; and BATF2: 868% [806-931]), independent of age, sex, HIV status, previous tuberculosis, or sputum smear result. At test thresholds that gave 70% specificity (the minimum WHO TPP specificity for a triage test), these four signatures achieved sensitivities between 833% (95% CI 713-910) and 907% (801-960). No signature met the optimum criteria, of 95% sensitivity and 80% specificity proposed by WHO for a triage test, or the minimum criteria (of 65% sensitivity and 98% specificity) for a confirmatory test, but all four correctly identified Ultra-positive, culture-negative patients. INTERPRETATION: Selected blood transcriptional signatures met the minimum WHO benchmarks for a tuberculosis triage test but not for a confirmatory test. Further development of the signatures is warranted to investigate their possible effects on clinical and health economic outcomes as part of a triage strategy, or when used as add-on confirmatory test in conjunction with the highly sensitive Ultra test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA.

The 31 subjects in the non-TB control group were staff from Wuhan Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Institute. The 55 cases in the TB control group were in-patients during September 2004 to December 2007 who were diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis. The 89 cases in the MDR-TB group were in-patients during the same period, but who were diagnosed as having MDR-TB. Peripheral mononuclear cells were isolated and mRNA levels of P-pg and MRP were measured by real-time PCR.

The nanocomposite of type GO@Fe(3)O(4)@Pt was used as a signal reporter with excellent catalytic activity and recyclability. The nanocomposite exhibits peroxidase-like activity for hydrogen peroxide, best at -0.25V (vs. Ag/AgCl). It works over a wide range of pH values (2-10) and temperatures (25-65C). Further signal amplification strategy was accomplished by rolling circle amplification. This voltammetric assay has a linear response to the logarithm of MPT64 concentration in therange from 5.0fgmL(-1) to 1.0ngmL(-1) and a detection limit of 0.34fgmL(-1) (at asignal to noise ratioof 3, forn=10). The assay can be completed within 4h. It was successfully applied to the determination of MPT64 in spiked serum samples.

The prognostic impact of these co infections in HIV-population in resource-limited countries like Pakistan has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to assess CD4 and hemoglobin (Hb) levels in patients with HIV mono infection and HIV co-infection with Hepatitis C (HCV), Hepatitis B (HBV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). METHODS: A total of 207 HIV positive patients were assessed for CD4 cells count and hemoglobin levels after confirmation of HIV by rapid tests as well as PCR. CD4 counts were performed via flow cytometry whereas hemoglobin levels were performed by Sysmex K-4500 auto-analyzer. RESULTS: Out of 207 patients, 22 patients were found to be HIV mono-infected, while 185 patients were HIV positive along with co-infections of MTB or HCV or HBV. We found significant positive correlation between HB levels and CD4 count across the studied group (r=0.30 in HIV mono-infected group, r=0.23 in HIV co-infected group, p<0.05) at baseline. However, majority of the low hemoglobin levels (<8g/dl) and low CD4 count (<200cells/ul) cases were observed particularly in HIV/TB co-infections. CONCLUSION: This study documents the prognostic value of hemoglobin assessment in HIV patients. The results indicate that decreasing Hb levels correlate with decreasing CD4 counts. It is emphasizing that Hb measurement may be used as an inexpensive surrogate marker as compared to CD4 analysis for disease progression in HIV patients. In addition, low Hb levels may also indicate presence of under lying co-infections, particularly, with M. tuberculosis (MTB)."

To define better the T cell populations that contribute to the immunopathogenesis of human tuberculosis, we investigated the T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain repertoire expressed in patients with tuberculous pleuritis. Analysis by polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry indicated an expansion of V beta 8+ T cells at the site of disease in some donors, suggesting the possibility that Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains a superantigen. M. tuberculosis induced strong T cell proliferative responses in tuberculin-negative healthy donors in vitro, with preferential expansion of V beta 8+ T cells, independent of the CDR3 region. T cell stimulation was MHC class II-dependent and did not require antigen processing by the antigen-presenting cells. These findings are consistent with the presence of a superantigen in M. tuberculosis, aspects of which may contribute to the immunopathology of tuberculosis and to the adjuvant properties of M. tuberculosis."

The latter have occasionally been reported as the cause of bovine clinical mastitis, but recent reports are scarce. In this study, Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (basonym Mycobacterium smegmatis) was identified as cause of granulomatous, relapsing clinical mastitis in 2 cows from one Belgian dairy herd. Milk, blood, and fecal samples were collected, as well as tissue samples after the cows were culled. Serological analysis conducted on milk and serum samples resulted in positive reactions for MAP, but negative for Mycobacterium bovis.

In view of the convenience, low cost and comparable sensitivity with PCR, these ELISA tests have a promising future in the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis.  2006 Oxford University Press."

The primers were designed to amplify a 320-bp fragment of Mycobacterium 16S rRNA genes. Reaction specificity was evaluated using PCR amplification curves along with specific melting temperatures of probes on DNA extracted from 13 Mycobacterium species. In this study, results showed 100% accuracy for the selected bacterial panel. Detection limits were 350, 600, and 650 colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml blood culture broths for M. tuberculosis complex, M. avium, and M. intracellulare, respectively (1 to 2 CFU/reaction). To evaluate clinical applicability, 341 acid-fast bacilli in blood culture broths were analyzed.

Differential diagnosis is important because diseases caused by other aetiologies and a clinical spectrum similar to that of leishmaniasis (e.g. leprosy, skin cancers and tuberculosis for CL; malaria and schistosomiasis for VL) are often present in endemic areas of endemicity. Presently, a variety of methods have been developed and tested to aid the identification and diagnosis of Leishmania. The advent of the PCR technology has opened new channels for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis in a variety of clinical materials. PCR is a simple, rapid procedure that has been adapted for diagnosis of leishmaniasis. A range of tools is currently available for the diagnosis and identification of leishmaniasis and Leishmania species, respectively. However, none of these diagnostic tools are examined and tested using samples spotted on FTA cards. Three different PCR-based approaches were examined including: kDNA minicircle, Leishmania 18S rRNA gene and PCR-RFLP of Intergenic region of ribosomal protein. PCR primers were designed that sit within the coding sequences of genes (relatively well conserved) but which amplify across the intervening intergenic sequence (relatively variable). These were used in PCR-RFLP on reference isolates of 10 of the most important Leishmania species: L. donovani, L. infantum, L. major & L. tropica. Digestion of PCR products with restriction enzymes produced species-specific restriction patterns allowed discrimination of reference isolates. The kDNA minicircle primers are highly sensitive in diagnosis of both bone marrow and skin smears from FTA cards. Leishmania 18S rRNA gene conserved region is sensitive in identification of bone marrow smear but less sensitive in diagnosing skin smears. The intergenic nested PCR-RFLP using P5 & P6 as well as P1 & P2 newly designed primers showed high level of reproducibility and sensitivity. Though, it was less sensitive than kDNA minicircle primers, but easily discriminated between Leishmania species."

The rapid and accurate diagnosis of malaria remains a challenge in most of the endemic areas. The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the performance of multiplex/nested PCR in detecting Plasmodium falciparum at low parasite densities and mixed infection. METHODS: The study was performed in the Sistan-Baluchestan province of the southeastern Iran, from May 2015 to July 2016. A total of 105 patients suspected to malaria infection were enrolled in the study. The obtained DNA products, extracted from the thick/thin films, were analyzed by multiplex/nested PCR using genus-specific primers and compared with light microscopy. RESULTS: 43 samples were confirmed to be infected by microscopic examination. Among 43 microscopically diagnosed P. falciparum cases, 11.4% (12/105) were confirmed by multiplex/nested PCR, 36.2% (38/105) were confirmed as P. vivax, 1.9% (2/105) had mixed infections with P. falciparum and P. vivax. Among microscopy-negative samples, 10 samples turned malaria-positive in nPCR. In multiplex/nested PCR, the rate of mixed infections was 8.6% (9/105). When compared to LM, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of multiplex/nested PCR were calculated to be 82.8, 91.5, 92.3 and 81.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study, we showed that microscopic examination of blood smears does not reliably distinguish Plasmodium species in the case of mixed infections. Therefore, it seems that multiplex/nested PCR is a good candidate for examining the presence of malaria parasites in clinically suspected but microscopically negative cases."

A report of eight patients.,0,"Papulonecrotic tuberculid (PNT), a form of cutaneous tuberculosis (TB), is uncommon in children. We identified eight children (six girls and two boys) with PNT. Their ages ranged from 19 to 139 months (median 47.5 months, mean:64.75 months). Skin lesions had been present for 2-24 weeks (median: 4 weeks) before diagnosis. All patients displayed scattered papulo- and/or pustulonecrotic lesions on the limbs, and the ears were involved in six patients. Lesions healed with varioliform scars. Associated pulmonary TB was present in seven patients. Additional clinical findings included fever (n = 4), hepatomegaly (n = 4), lymphadenopathy (n = 3), phlyctenular conjunctivitis (n = 3), and splenomegaly (n = 2). Histology of eight biopsies showed ulceration (n = 6), dermal necrosis (n = 6) (follicle-centered in two), granulomatous inflammation (n = 6) (palisading granuloma-like in three), superficial and deep infiltrate of lymphocytes (n = 7), erythrocyte extravasation (n = 7), and subepidermal edema (n = 3). Vasculitis was not a feature. A Ziehl-Neelsen stain was negative in all. Glycosaminoglycans were not increased. Immunohistochemistry found a predominance of T lymphocytes, macrophages, a few antigen-presenting cells, and no B lymphocytes, consistent with a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on deparaffinized tissue identified M. tuberculosis DNA in one biopsy. All patients received combination anti-TB treatment for 6 months. Six patients were compliant and were followed up for 6-30 months. Skin lesions and pulmonary TB healed in all. PNT in children resembles the adult form, but phlyctenular conjunctivitis and associated TB are more common, scrofuloderma and concomitant erythema induratum of Bazin are unusual, and vasculitis is not found. In cases where M. tuberculosis DNA can be confirmed with PCR, papulonecrotic TB is perhaps the more appropriate nomenclature."

Method: A total of 88 fresh venous blood from peripheral heparin anticoagulant population, 42 of which were from tuberculosis patients treated by The Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Center of Changping District, Beijing, and 46 of healthy volunteers were provided by the Infection Diseases of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Healthy volunteers without a history of tuberculosis exposure and any clinical signs and symptoms. Using the Mycobacterium tuberculosis standard strain H37Rv DNA as a template, complete genes of the selected 5 recombinant proteins Rv3874, Rv3875, Rv2031c, Rv1411c and Rv3418c by PCR amplified; 5 recombinant proteins were cloned, expressed and purified as stimulants by genetic recombination and protein purification techniques, and the effector T cell enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) was used to detect cellular immunity in the population. Results: The recombinant proteins Rv3874, Rv3875, Rv2031c, Rv1411c and Rv3418c were successfully cloned, expressed and purified; And the sensitivities were 50.00%, 71.43%, 69.04%, 73.81% and 76.19%, and the specificities were 86.96%, 76.09%, 71.74%, 39.13% and 36.96%. In addition, the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the curve and Youden index were 52.46% to 77.78%, 62.96% to 74.47%, 0.511 to 0.754 and 0.129 to 0.475, respectively. Except for Rv1411c and Rv3418c, the number of spot-forming cell (SFC) detected by Rv3874, Rv3875 and Rv2031c in tuberculosis patients was higher than healthy volunteers, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.001). Among the 26 compositions composed of 5 recombinant proteins, the sensitivity was 80.95% to 95.24%, and the specificity was 68.89% to 24.44%. As the number of recombinant proteins in the composition increases, the sensitivity gradually increased, but the specificity decreased. Conclusion: The recombinant proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv3874, Rv3875 and Rv2031c have strong ability to stimulate T cells to produce immune response, and have certain antigenicity. The efficacy of Rv1411c and Rv3418c alone as diagnostic antigens is not ideal, and the composition composed of multi-component antigens has certain application value. This article provides experimental evidence for the immune diagnosis of tuberculosis and the preparation of new anti-tuberculosis vaccines."

Clinical evaluation revealed stage IVB according to Ann Arbor classification and the presence of 5 unfavorable prognostic factors according to the International Prognostic Index. Despite BEACOPP chemotherapy (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone), the enlarged lymph nodes, lung infiltrations and fever persisted. Microbiological and serological tests did not lead to the identification of any viral or bacterial pathogens. Bronchoscopy showed chronic inflammation and post-tuberculosis (TB) scars in bronchi without acid-fast bacilli in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. However, the biopsy of the supraclavicular lymph node revealed multiple, caseating and necrotizing granulomatous lesions with scattered Reed-Sternberg (R-S) cells. The auramin staining presented acid-fast bacilli and allowed the diagnosis of productive and caseating TB coexisting with HL. The 4 tuberculostatics regimen and ABVD chemotherapy (adriamycin, bleomycin, vincristine, dacarbazine) resulted in a complete clinical response after 3 months of treatment. In conclusion, the association between HL and TB must be considered, especially in countries where the latter is endemic. The diagnosis may be difficult due to similarities in the clinical course, laboratory tests and imaging procedures."

A significantly lower phagocytosis was observed in NHS with AA genotype than in NHS with AO (heterozygotes) genotype (P = 0.046). In PTB patients, no such difference was observed. A negative correlation of macrophage phagocytosis with MBL level was seen in patients and NHS (P = 0.019). Antigen-induced lymphoproliferative response was significantly decreased in PTB patients with AA genotype as compared with NHS with AA genotype (P = 0.036).

Fever of unknown origin occurred two months after he had taken azathioprine at the age of two years and two months. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected from a gastric aspirate, and he was diagnosed as having disseminated BCG infection by means of the multiplex PCR method. Chest CT showed miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs on admission. Physical examination revealed enlarged lymphnodes, which were palpable around the neck and groin, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory data were within normal ranges except a slightly increased peripheral white blood cell and serum CRP level. He was treated with rifampicin (15 mg/kg/day), isoniazid (15 mg/kg/day) for 12 months, and streptomycin (25 mg/kg/day) for two months. He became afebrile a week after starting the treatment, and the miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs had disappeared by 5 months after starting the treatment. An abnormality of the NEMO gene, which is the gene responsible for ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency, was identified at the age of three years. It is assumed that an abnormality of the NEMO gene caused a latent BCG infection over a period of one year and ten months, and immunosuppressive medicine (azathioprine) induced a disseminated BCG infection. This case report supports that anti-tuberculosis medicine should be given to prevent disseminated BCG infection if an infant who receive immunosuppressive therapy is found to have an immune deficiency characterized by a mycobacterium infection after BCG vaccination."

However, its roles in tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) remain unknown. We aimed to investigate the potential involvement of IL-35 in TPE. MATERIAL/METHODS: Thirty TPE patients and 20 lung cancer patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) were recruited. Samples of pleural effusion (100 mL) were collected after traditional pleurocentesis. Blood was sampled from TPE patients. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. Proportions of Th1, Th17, and IL-35-producing cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. IL-35 was assessed by real-time RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunofluorescence. An ELISPOT assay was used to assess the effect of IL-35 on pleural effusion mononuclear cells (PEMCs). RESULTS: Proportions of IL-35-producing cells were higher in TPE compared with MPE (49.46.0 vs. 15.85.4%, P<0.001) and blood from TPE patients (49.46.0% vs. 16.63.1, P<0.001). IL-35, IL-17 and IFN- were elevated in TPE compared with MPE (all P<0.01). ELISPOT assay showed that IL-35 reduced the proportion of IFN--producing CD4+ T cells in TPE. IL-35 mRNA expression was higher in TPE compared with MPE (P<0.001). Immunofluorescence showed that IL-35-positive cells were present in pleural tissues from TPE patients. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that there is an imbalance in IL-35 metabolism in TPE. However, further studies are required to assess the exact relationship with the immune system response to tuberculosis. IL-35 might play a role in TPE and might be targeted as a treatment for TPE."

Skin inflammation through proinflammatory cytokines creates a favorable environment for microbial antigens and optimal conditions for infection (1). In case of underlying immunosuppression, inflammatory features of dermatitis and superimposed infections are more severe. The presence of minor trauma of the skin in the form of fissures can favor both easier inoculation of some bacterial germs, leading to a dermatitis superinfection, and/or the transcutaneous inoculation of atypical mycobacteria, with a possibility of developing localized types of tuberculous lymphadenitis (TLA). TLA, the localized type of systemic tuberculosis (TB) infection, is the most common form of extra-pulmonary TB in developing countries (2), while lymphadenitis due to atypical mycobacteria is a localized disease, more frequently seen in developed countries (3,4). In tuberculosis, the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is airborne, while in atypical mycobacterium lymphadenitis transmission can be both airborne or by ingestion or inoculation (5). In both forms of TB, lymphadenopathy evolves towards abscess and presents fibrotic scars or calcifications upon healing (6). A positive diagnosis involves a clinical and epidemiological investigation, a purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test, ultrasound, and CT / MRI of lymph node masses. A lymph node biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis of TB and PCR, while positive culture confirms the etiology of TB lymphadenitis. The differential diagnosis of TLA is difficult: neoplastic, bacterial, or viral and fungal infections, sarcoidosis, Castleman's disease, drug reactions, etc. (5). TB-induced immunosuppression may favor the development of fungal and bacterial infections, sometimes severe and poorly responsive to treatment. On the other hand, immunosuppressive conditions increase the risk of extra-pulmonary TB (2). A 40-year old woman who had experienced recurrent episodes of dermatitis over the previous 7 years was hospitalized with fever, malaise, and a disseminated erythematous and crusted, exudative, and flexural itching rash (Figure 1). There were fetid, purulent secretions at the conjunctival, auricular, genital, and umbilical areas. The clinical exam also revealed lymphadenopathy syndrome (large, painful submandibular, cervical, and axillar bilateral lymph nodes; an indurated, painful, and adherent left inguinal lymph node of 5-6 cm). Microbial cultures isolated multiple multi-drug-resistant bacteria (SAH-MRSA, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, Enterobacter) and Candida albicans in the oral cavity and conjunctival, auricular, nasal, umbilical, and genital areas. The skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of dermatitis. PPD skin test was 21 mm. Other tests (HIV and syphilis serology, blood culture, chest X-ray) were negative. Systemic treatment with vancomycin, metronidazole, fluconazole, local antiseptic compresses, and topical corticosteroid ointments was initiated. 2 days after starting the treatment with vancomycin, Redman syndrome occurred (headache, dyspnea, colicky pains, myalgia, rush, fever (39 C), hypotension (80/40 mmHg), and tachycardia (100 bpm)). This syndrome resolved upon discontinuation of Vancomycin. Further treatment with imipenem/cilastatinand linezolid for 14 days lead to a favorable response with amelioration of the symptoms. Biopsy of the submandibular lymph node raised the suspicion of Castleman's disease; however, due to the overall incomplete clinical picture (no night sweats, no weight reduction, lack of hepatosplenomegaly and peripheral neuropathy), we decided to perform a biopsy of an inguinal lymph node. The histopathological aspect suggested TLA (lymphoid hyperplasia predominantly diffuse, reactive, presenting tuberculous follicles with central caseous necrosis) (Figure 2). A combination of specific antituberculous drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for 6 months resolved the lymphadenopathy syndrome with no further recurrence of eczema and skin infections. Certain delayed hypersensitivity mechanisms are involved both in dermatitis and in TB. CD4 lymphocytes are the primary mediators of anti-TB immunity, while proinflammatory cytokines mediate the activation of macrophages involved in controlling bacillary growth (1). In cases of superinfected dermatitis, microbial exotoxins penetrate the skin barrier more easily due to inflammation. Released cytokines (IL-1, TNF, and IL12) favor the expression of E-selectin on endothelial vascular growth factor and on skin lymphocyte antigen expression, with amplification of initial skin inflammation and creating favorable conditions for microbial colonization and infection (7). The common denominator in dermatitis and TB are the circulating immune complexes (up to 56% of TB cases), which are formed by the interaction between an antibody and bacterial antigen (8), which was in this case evidenced by increased levels of IgA and IgG. In our case, the frequent recurrences of infected dermatitis with multiple multi-drug-resistant germs that were poorly responsive to treatment and displayed a severe evolution towards generalization as well as the lymphadenopathy and the persistence of a biological inflammatory syndrome indicated that another immunosuppressive cause could be involved. Isolated bacterial and fungal germs changed the immune status of the patient. The risk of mycobacterium infection was increased by the environment they created and the patient's underlying skin inflammation. The diagnosis of TB lymphadenitis was established by the histopathologist, but in the absence of PCR we could not determine whether the TB infection was caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or by atypical mycobacteria. Given that there was no evidence of other sites of TB infection, we conjectured that inoculation of mycobacterium took place at the skin lesion and that an atypical mycobacterium might have contributed to the etiology of the TLA. In our case, the anti-tuberculous drugs and skin infection treatment with follow-up of the side-effects led to complete remission of mycobacterium lymphadenitis, dermatitis, and infectious processes, without relapses. In conclusion, in the present case chronic dermatitis alongside infection with multi-drug-resistant germs led to an immunosuppressive status which, when associated with the presence of multiple skin ports of entry, allowed a mycobacterial infection at the inguinal lymph node level. Inguinal TLA induced severe dermatitis and difficulties in diagnosis and treatment."

We performed iTRAQ labeling coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) and Solexa sequencing among MDR-TB patients, drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) patients, and healthy controls. A total of 50 differentially expressed proteins and 43 differentially expressed miRNAs (fold change >1.50 or <0.60, P<0.05) were identified in the MDR-TB patients compared to both DS-TB patients and healthy controls. We found that 22.00% of differentially expressed proteins and 32.56% of differentially expressed miRNAs were related, and could construct a network mainly in complement and coagulation cascades. Significant differences in CD44 antigen (CD44), coagulation factor XI (F11), kininogen-1 (KNG1), miR-4433b-5p, miR-424-5p, and miR-199b-5p were found among MDR-TB patients, DS-TB patients and healthy controls (P<0.05) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SYBR green qRT-PCR validation. A strong negative correlation, consistent with the target gene prediction, was found between miR-199b-5p and KNG1 (r=-0.232, P=0.017).

For individual animals, positive correlations were observed between mRNA and protein levels of bovine PPD-induced IFN-gamma and IL-2, although the correlations were stronger for IFN-gamma. Expression of these two cytokines also correlated with responses from a comparative intradermal test and a M. bovis antibody test. At 7 and 20 weeks after inoculation, bovine PPD-induced IFN-gamma and IL-2 mRNA expression was detected in all animals with tuberculous lesions and in a proportion of the M. bovis-inoculated animals with no lesions. Correlation of antigen-induced IFN-gamma and IL-2 with other immune parameters suggests that these two cytokines play an important role in the immune response to bovine tuberculosis."

In this paper, the efficiency of nucleic acid amplification techniques for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections is reviewed. In general, these techniques should be applied only for the detection of microorganisms for which available diagnostic techniques are markedly insensitive or nonexistent or when turnaround times for existing tests (e.g., viral culture) are much longer than those expected with amplification. This is the case for rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and hantaviruses causing a pulmonary syndrome, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii. For Legionella spp. and fungi, contamination originating from the environment is a limiting factor in interpretation of results, as is the difficulty in differentiating colonization and infection. Detection of these agents in urine or blood by amplification techniques remains to be evaluated. In the clinical setting, there is no need for molecular diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii. At present, amplification methods for Mycobacterium tuberculosis cannot replace the classical diagnostic techniques, due to their lack of sensitivity and the absence of specific internal controls for the detection of inhibitors of the reaction. Also, the results of interlaboratory comparisons are unsatisfactory. Furthermore, isolates are needed for susceptibility studies. Additional work remains to be done on sample preparation methods, comparison between different amplification methods, and analysis of results. The techniques can be useful for the rapid identification of M. tuberculosis in particular circumstances, as well as the rapid detection of most rifampin-resistant isolates. The introduction of diagnostic amplification techniques into a clinical laboratory implies a level of proficiency for excluding false-positive and false-negative results."

In sarcoidosis, activation of T-helper cells is observed, which is comparable to tuberculosis. The aim of this study was first to investigate whether M. tuberculosis DNA could be retrospectively detected in samples of patients with clinically verified sarcoidosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and second, to analyze the relationship between M. tuberculosis DNA positive samples and T-cell response in sarcoidosis patients. Formalin fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissues or cell sediments of bronchoalveolar lavage, respectively, from 65 patients with sarcoidosis and lung tissues from 40 tuberculosis patients were investigated by means of different PCR assays in comparison to control samples. The primers used were derived from insertion sequence IS 986/6110 specific for the M. tuberculosis complex (123 bp PCR) and from the gene encoding the 38 kDa protein antigen b (419 bp PCR). The 123 bp assay yielded a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity of 95%. In contrast, the 419 bp PCR method showed a lower sensitivity of only 8% likely because of possible DNA degradation during fixation and embedding procedures of the tissue and the fact that this PCR uses a single copy element as target. We amplified the M. tuberculosis complex specific 123 bp fragment in 64% of samples from sarcoidosis patients. The specificity of PCR products in these cases was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Interestingly in the M. tuberculosis positive sarcoidoses, we found increased serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor in correlation to the sarcoidosis stages (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the determination of M. tuberculosis by PCR alone does not permit a differentiation between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. However these results support the contention that M. tuberculosis may play a pathogenetic role at least in the part of sarcoidosis patients with elevated interleukin-2 receptor values."

METHODS: Mtb ClpP2 was cloned into recombinant plasmid pET32a (+) and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the expression of the recombinant protein. The immunogenicity of Mtb ClpP2 was assessed with epitope prediction and antibody titer assay. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the influence of stress conditions on ClpP2 expression. ClpP2 antigen and antibody in patients with pulmonary diseases were detected by indirect ELISA. ROC curve was constructed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Mtb ClpP2 for tuberculosis. RESULTS: We had cloned and expressed recombinant Mtb ClpP2 in E. coli. Our results showed that Mtb ClpP2 had potent immunogenicity, and our own prepared polyclonal antibody could be used in detection and diagnostic tests. Results from Western blot showed that ClpP2 was mainly located in M. bovis BCG cytoplasm, and real-time PCR indicated that stress conditions could enhance the mRNA expression of ClpP2. Indirect ELISA suggested that, in tuberculosis patients, both the levels of ClpP2 antigen and antibody were increased, and the positive rates of ClpP2 were elevated. ROC curve had demonstrated satisfactory sensitivity and specificity of ClpP2-based diagnosis for tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Mtb ClpP2 antigens would be used as a biomarker in tuberculosis pathogenesis. These findings highlight the feasibility of the application of Mtb ClpP2 in the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis."

The aims of the present study were to develop an assay, based on a single-tube, nested PCR, for identifying Brucella in samples of human blood and then to explore the use of this test in diagnosis. The primers chosen were derived from IS711, the insertion sequence gene found in all species of Brucella. The assay amplified a 52-bp final product which was detected colorimetrically. The PCR was sensitive and specific, giving positive reactions with 14 strains of Brucella from five species. The lower limit of detection in vitro was 30 organisms. There were no false-positive reactions either with a range of bacteria known to evoke serological cross-reactions with Brucella (Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli K12) or with organisms producing similar clinical syndromes (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhi). The results of a preliminary field trial of the assay in Kuwait indicate that the assay may be a valuable technique in the diagnosis of human brucellosis, meriting further study with larger numbers of cases. All 28 subjects with brucellosis (diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical features and confirmed by positive serology and, in three cases, by positive blood cultures) were PCR-positive whereas 28 healthy controls and 28 patients with febrile illness attributable to infections other than brucellosis were PCR-negative."

PML is seen primarily in immunosuppressed (AIDS, organ transplant or malignancy) patients. In this report, a case of PML that developed in a 75-years-old female patient with no known immunosuppression was presented. The patient was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of headache and burning sensation in head. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed increase in lymphocytic cells. Since lesions compatible with tuberculoma were detected in brain tissue by magnetic resonance imaging, antituberculous therapy initiated empirically. The disease exhibited a progressive course and all the serological, molecular, microbiological and biochemical tests performed in blood and CSF failed to identify the causative agent. Pathological and immunohistochemical examination of the brain biopsy specimens demonstrated demyelinating disease. Brain biopsy, CSF, serum and urine specimens were investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction specific for JCV and JCV-DNA was detected in the urine samples. Follow-up visits of the patient indicated a progressive course. In conclusion, after ruling out the other primary causes, JCV should be investigated in patients with demyelinating CNS disease even in the absence of significant immunosuppressive condition. Elderly patients should be considered in the risk group for demyelinating disease of CNS due to JCV."

The goal for low-resource settings is a simple, inexpensive instrument. Toward this goal, we previously published a self-contained sample preparation instrument that uses magnetics and prearrayed reagents in thin tubing to extract nucleic acids and perform isothermal amplification and detection of extracted biomarkers. To incorporate PCR thermal cycling, after biomarker is magnetically extracted from a patient sample, the section of tubing containing the extracted biomarker and PCR reagents is alternately positioned within two constant temperature blocks. This instrument was evaluated initially by extracting and amplifying a 140 bp fragment of the IS6110 sequence of tuberculosis from TE buffer. The mean cycle threshold for 5 10(6) copies of IS6110 was 25.5  1.5 cycles (n = 4), which was significantly different from negative control samples (34.0  2.6 cycles; n = 3). Using a more clinically relevant sample, we extracted and amplified Plasmodium falciparum DNA from malaria-infected human blood cultures. The average cycle threshold for 1% parasitemia samples was 24.7  1.5 cycles (n = 3) and significantly different from negatives (31.5  2.1 cycles; n = 3). This approach integrates biomarker extraction, PCR amplification, and detection in a simple, linear tubing design with potential for use as a low-resource instrument."

However data on interleukin (IL)-4 expression in HIV or AIDS are un-interpretable because of failure to distinguish between IL-4 and its splice variant and natural antagonist, IL-4delta2. OBJECTIVE: To determine Th1 [interferon (IFN)-gamma], IL-4delta2 and Th2 (IL-4) expression in whole blood and lung lavage from healthy volunteers and in HIV or HIV-tuberculosis (TB) co-infection. DESIGN: Cross-sectional with prospective cohort. METHODS: Expression of IL-4delta2, IL-4 and IFN-gamma were determined by quantitative real-time PCR, using unstimulated cells from whole blood and lung lavage, in 20 HIV-TB (pulmonary) co-infected patients, 20 matched HIV-positive controls and 20 HIV-negative healthy volunteers. Results were correlated with plasma viral load, CD4 cell counts, radiological scores and response to anti-TB treatment. RESULTS: Compared to HIV negative donors, stable HIV-positive donors did not have increased levels of mRNA encoding IL-4, IL-4delta2 or IFN-gamma in blood or lavage. By contrast, the HIV-TB co-infected donors had increased IL-4 and IFN-gamma in both compartments. However the antagonist, IL-4delta2 was increased only in lavage. Consequently the dominant form was IL-4delta2 in lavage, but IL-4 itself in blood. The lung IL-4/IFN-gamma ratio correlated with radiological disease extent. With anti-TB treatment, IL-4 levels did not change whilst IL-4delta2 levels increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: IL-4 and its natural antagonist, IL-4delta2 and are not upregulated in the absence of opportunistic infection. However in HIV-TB co-infection both cytokines increase in lung, but only IL-4 in the periphery. Further studies are required to determine if IL-4 facilitates systemic HIV progression."

Diagnosis of mycobaterium-induced septicemia generally involves the use of mycobacterium-designated bottles, MGIT method, and Ogawa medium; however, we used microbe cultures with routine blood-culture bottles in the present case. Of the 24 mycobacterium-induced septicemia cases reported in the past 10 years, only eight cases were detected from routine blood-culture bottles; they were all rapidly growing bacteria. Mycobacteria other than the rapidly growing mycobacteria display delayed culture proliferation, therefore it is possible that non-detected microbes were probably present in the patients despite the fact that they were suffering from septicemia. In cases suspected to have severe infections, particularly those with a depressed immunodefense system, blood-culture testing for mycobacteria would be highly helpful for diagnosis."

All PML Zambian patients tested were seropositive for JCV compared to 46% in a control group of HIV(+) and HIV(-) Zambian patients without PML. PML occurs among HIV-infected individuals in Zambia and is caused by CNS infection with prototype JCV, while archetype JCV strains are present in their urine. JCV seroprevalence is comparable in Zambia and the USA, and PML should be included in the differential diagnosis of immunosuppressed individuals presenting with neurological dysfunction in Zambia."

METHODS: From January 1996 to August 2002, in seventy seven patients AE was diagnosed on the basis of lymphocytic predominance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and negative culture of CSF. Analysis comprised: etiology, course of the disease and spectrum of used diagnostic tests. RESULTS: In 48/77 patients (62.3%) etiology was not identified. In 8/77 patients (10.3%) herpes simplex encephalitis was diagnosed, in 7/77 (9.1%) neuroborreliosis, in 6/77 (7.8%) tuberculosis encephalitis, in 3/77 (3.9%) listerial meningitis, in 3/77 (3.9%) mumps meningitis, and in remaining 2/77 (2.6%) tick-borne encephalitis. The incidence of AE was higher in summer (42.9%) than in any other season. In 14/77 patients (18.2%) the episode of unconsciousness occurred in the course of the disease. In 6 of these 14 patient etiology was unknown, in 4 tuberculosis AE, in 2 herpes simplex encephalitis and in 2 neuroborreliosis was diagnosed.

He was hospitalized in the psychopathic ward under the initial diagnosis of depression. Chest X-ray showed infiltration in both upper lobe. Twelve days later, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected from his sputum and was confirmed by RT-PCR. Cerebrospinal fluid findings showed elevated ADA and mononuclear cells, suggesting the presence of tuberculous meningitis. However, the brain CT revealed no abnormal findings. By applying antituberculous treatment the pulmonary lesion improved but psychological symptoms remained. Three months later follow-up brain MRI was examined. Contrast enhanced granuloma was detected in the ambiens, suprasellar and quadrigeminal cisterns. A strong signal was seen in the left frontal thalamus and a weak enhanced lesion was detected in the right frontal thalamus on a T2 enhanced image. These lesions showed low intensity on a T1 enhanced image, suggesting cerebral infarction affecting the bilateral thalamus. Somnolence and memory disorder was due to cerebral infarction of the bilateral thalamus and tuberculous meningitis contributed to form the intracranial lesion. From the experience of this case, it is needed to consider cerebral infarction (especially the thalamus) due to tuberculous meningitis when we examine the patients with acute onset of psychological symptoms."

We undertook a case-control study at a tertiary care center at New Delhi, India to identify the clinical and genetic predictors of MDR-TB as compared to the drug sensitive TB cases. Patients with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis were identified on the basis of drug sensitivity testing by the proportion method. Treatment was initiated according to standard norms and all patients were followed up during the period. Genomic DNA extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cell pellet was used for amplification of HLA class II region (second exon) with a set of forward (5') and reverse (3') primers. A sequence specific 5' biotinylated probes were used to determine 12 DRB1, 8 DQA1 and 13 DQB1 alleles by the PCR-SSOP method. Past history of disease, higher severity of illness, inadequacy of drug treatment and presence of HLA-DRB1*14, DQB1*0503 and DQB1*0502 alleles were found to be significant risk factors for MDR-TB. Multivariate analysis identified poor past compliance to treatment (odds ratio, OR=6.6; 95% confidence interval, CI [2.0-21.5]), higher number of cavities (OR=6; 95% CI [2.1-17.3]) in chest radiographs and the presence of the HLA-DRB1*14 allele (OR=8.2; 95% CI [2.1-31.3]) as independent predictors of MDR-TB. Our results suggest that a combination of clinical and immunogenetic parameters could provide better information on drug resistance in tuberculosis with implications in therapy."

Methods: Circulating tumor cells were enriched from 3-ml peripheral blood by immunomagnetic depletion of leukocytes and then labeled with a conjugate of a tumor-specific ligand folic acid and a synthesized oligonucleotide. After washing off free conjugates, the stripped bound conjugates were analyzed by quantitative PCR. Results: Seven hundred fifty-six participants (473 patients with NSCLC, 227 patients with lung benign disease, and 56 healthy donors) were randomly assigned to a training set and a test set. The circulating tumor cell (CTC) levels in patients with NSCLC were significant higher than those with lung benign disease (p < 0.001) and healthy donors (p < 0.001). Compared with carcinoembryonic antigen, neuron-specific enolase, and Cyfra21-1, CTCs displayed the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (training set, 0.815; validation set, 0.813) in the diagnosis of NSCLC, with a markedly sensitivity (training set, 72.46%; validation set, 76.37%) and specificity (training set, 88.65%; validation set, 82.39%). The model combining CTCs with carcinoembryonic antigen, neuronspecific enolase, and Cyfra21-1 was more effective for the diagnosis of NSCLC than tumor makers alone (sensitivity and specificity in the training set, 84.21% and 83.91%; validation set, 88.78% and 87.36%, respectively). In addition, the CTC levels were higher in patients with stage III/IV NSCLC compared with those with stage I/II disease. Conclusion: Ligand-targeted PCR technique was feasible and reliable for detecting folate receptor-positive CTCs in patients with NSCLC, and CTC levels could be used as a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of NSCLC."

These infections must be effectively identified and targeted for elimination. The sensitivity of light microscopy, the traditional method used for diagnosing Plasmodium infections, is frequently insufficient for detecting asymptomatic infections due to the low density of parasitaemia. The objective of this study was to explore the current prevalence of asymptomatic sub-microscopic Plasmodium carriages to evaluate the parasite reservoir amongst residents from 7 hamlets in Tak Province in northwestern Thailand using a highly sensitive molecular method. METHODS: Malaria infection was screened in a real-world setting from 3650 finger-prick blood specimens collected in a mass cross-sectional survey using light microscopy and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). LAMP results were later confirmed in alaboratory setting in Bangkok using nested PCR, restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The association of malaria infection with demographic factors was explored. RESULTS: Parasite prevalence was 0.27% (10/3650) as determined by microscopy. Sub-microscopic infection prevalence was 2.33% (85/3650) by LAMP. Of these, 30.6% (26/85) were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, 52.9% (45/85) with Plasmodium vivax, 2.4% (2/85) with Plasmodium malariae, 4.7% (4/85) with mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax, and 9.4% (8/85) had parasite densities too low for species identification. Asymptomatic carriages (T<37.5C) accounted for 95% (76/80) of all sub-microscopic cases with the highest prevalence occurring in the subjects 31-45years of age (p0.035). Participants working on plantations or as merchants had an increased infection risk. Evaluation by microscopy identified 10.53% (10/95) of all Plasmodium infected participants. CONCLUSION: Participants carrying asymptomatic Plasmodium infections with sub-microscopic parasite densities are considerable in this area. These findings provide the true disease burden and risk factors in this region. This information helps to direct policy makers towards better schemes and delivery of targeted interventions. Moreover, this is the first study to use LAMP in mass screening for sub-clinical and sub-microscopic infections in a field setting in Thailand. LAMP proves to be a sensitive and field-deployable assay suitable for national malaria control screening campaigns."

Application of live BCG vaccine and L-form transformation of vaccine strain may display a new intriguing aspect concerning the opportunity for occurrence of unpredictable colonization inside the human body by unusual microbial life forms. L-form cultures were isolated from 141 blood samples of people previously vaccinated with BCG, none with a history of exposure to tuberculosis. Innovative methodology to access the unusual L-form elements derived from human blood was developed. The methodology outlines the path of transformation of non- cultivable L-form element to cultivable bacteria and their adaptation for growth in vitro. All isolates showed typical L-forms growth features (""fried eggs"" colonies and biofilm). Electron microscopy revealed morphology evidencing peculiar characteristics of bacterial L-form population (cell wall deficient polymorphic elements of variable shape and size). Regular detection of acid fast bacteria in smears of isolated blood L-form cultures, led us to start their identification by using specific Mycobactrium spp. genetic tests. Forty five of 97 genetically tested blood cultures provided specific positive signals for mycobacteria, confirmed by at least one of the 3 specific assays (16S rRNA PCR; IS6110 Real Time PCR and spoligotyping). In conclusion, the obtained genetic evidence suggests that these L-forms are of mycobacterial origin. As the investigated people had been vaccinated with BCG, we can assume that the identified mycobacterial L-forms may be produced by persisting live BCG vaccine."

Colitis, a kind of colonic inflammatory damage could be induced by different chemicals. The pathogenesis and mechanism of colitis remains unclear, and may be related to intestinal microflora, genetic susceptibility or immune factors. The aim is to explore the effects of GOS on intestinal flora and its anti-inflammatory effects in Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) induced murine colitis and extrapolate the underlying mechanism. MAIN METHODS: Initially, 5% DSS was used to induced colitis by free access to drinking water for 5-7days. Then the mice were treated with GOS 1day after DSS treatment. Colon samples were evaluated grossly using a microscope. The percentage of Treg and Th17 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The levels of cytokines secretion and mRNA expression were detected by ELISA and real-time PCR. The level of protein was detected by western blot. KEY FINDINGS: GOS attenuated DSS induced body weight loss and also reduced the increase in disease index caused by DSS. GOS ameliorated DSS induced colonic histological damage. The protective effect of GOS on DSS induced colitis may be partly attributed to intestinal flora regulation and Th17/Treg imbalance. Furthermore, GOS markedly decreased cytokines (IL-6, IL-18, IL-13 and IL-33) secretion and mRNA expression in colon tissues, through inhibiting activation of NF-B pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: GOS could prevent the DSS induced colitis through intestinal flora regulation and reduce the secretion of inflammation related cytokines relying on the NF-B signaling pathway."

However, a higher HCMV DNA copy number in blood serum was observed in IPF patients than in controls (log10=3.2 vs. 2.0, respectively). We conclude that the lungs play an important role in the human pathobiology of cytomegalovirus sustenance."

Bacterial DNA can be detected in a wide variety of samples provided at least partial sequence information is available. For a great number of bacteria PCR detection methods have been published. Most important for the pathologist are mycobacteriae (M. tuberculosis, avium, etc.). Borellia burgdorferi, Listeria monozytogenes and chlamydiae (Ce. trachomatis, C. psittaci). Fresh or fixed paraffin embedded tissues, exfoliated cells, whole blood, serum, sputum, urine, ascites or pleural fluid etc. can be analyzed. The time needed to perform the analysis varies between 5 hours and 2 days mostly depending on the DNA extraction method. Several potential pitfalls have to be avoided. The most common problem is contamination of reagents with target DNA. Amplification of DNA from biological samples may be prevented by enzyme inhibitors (salts, proteins). This problem can at least partially be avoided by changing the DNA purification method. Several additional problems may arise if bacterial DNA has to be amplified. Bacterial walls may have to be disrupted using heat or detergent for accessibility of target DNA. Positive results have to be judged carefully. Unlike the situation in retroviral infections with the virus sometimes present in the absence of disease, in the majority of bacterial infections the presence of bacteria signals manifest disease. A possible exception may be the finding of mycobacterial DNA in sarcoidosis patients who can be treated with steroids without provoking tuberculosis. PCR is especially useful in situations where rapid results are necessary or only fixed tissue is available.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In the present study, an 82-kDa protein antigen was isolated by affinity chromatography and was identified by peptide mass fingerprinting as isocitrate dehydrogenase II, which is encoded by the icd2 gene of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The icd2 gene of BCG was cloned by PCR, and the product of recombinant gene expression was purified and analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant protein, named rICD2, was tested for its recognition by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from the sera of 16 patients with tuberculosis (TB) and 23 healthy individuals by Western blotting. The results showed that rICD2 is recognized by IgG antibodies from the sera of all TB patients tested at serum dilutions of 1:640. At a serum dilution of 1:1,280, the sensitivity was 50% and the specificity was 86.9%. These results indicate that rICD2 might represent a candidate for use in a new assay for the serodiagnosis of TB."

From a total of 30 flocks, 632 sheep and goats had faecal, serum, and whole-blood samples examined by culture, complement fixation test (CFT), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeted at IS900, IS1245, and IS6110. PCR produced positive results in 21% of the animals tested, with 5.6%, 3.9%, and 11.5% being identified as MAP, Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, respectively. CFT produced positive and suspicious results in 4.4% and 14.4% of the cases. Faecal cultures were negative in all but a single case that was identified as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-type BC1. Agreement between results obtained by PCR and CFT was poor with isolated cases although an assessment of the MAP positive tests produced similar results for both methods. The findings indicate the need for additional measures of control, although the costs may be substantial if public health protection justifies elimination of MAP from livestock.  2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Several factors influence the efficacy of TB treatment by leading to suboptimal drug concentrations and subsequently affecting treatment outcome. The aim of this cohort is to determine the association between anti-TB drug concentrations and TB treatment outcomes. PARTICIPANTS: Patients diagnosed with new pulmonary TB at the integrated TB-HIV outpatient clinic in Kampala, Uganda, were enrolled into the study and started on first-line anti-TB treatment. FINDINGS TO DATE: Between April 2013 and April 2015, the cohort enrolled 268 patients coinfected with TB/HIV ; 57.8% are male with a median age of 34 years (IQR 29-40). The median time between the diagnosis of HIV and the diagnosis of TB is 2 months (IQR 0-22.5). The majority of the patients are antiretroviral therapy naive (75.4%). Our population is severely immunosuppressed with a median CD4 cell count at enrolment of 163cells/L (IQR 46-298). Ninety-nine per cent of the patients had a diagnosis of pulmonary TB confirmed by sputum microscopy, Xpert/RIF or culture and 203 (75.7%) have completed TB treatment with 5099 aliquots of blood collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. FUTURE PLANS: This cohort provides a large database of well-characterised patients coinfected with TB/HIV which will facilitate the description of the association between serum drug concentrations and TB treatment outcomes as well as provide a research platform for future substudies including evaluation of virological outcomes.

In this work, the biological activity of the Rv2560 protein was characterized and evaluated. Primers used in PCR and RT-PCR assays revealed that the gene encoding protein Rv2560 is present in M. tuberculosis complex strains, but transcribed in only some of them. Sera obtained from rabbits inoculated with polymer peptides from this protein recognized a 33 kDa band in the M. tuberculosis lysate and a membrane fraction corresponding to the predicted molecular mass (33.1 kDa) of this protein. Immunoelectron microscopy analysis found this protein on the mycobacterial membrane. Sixteen peptides covering its entire length were chemically synthesized and tested for their ability to bind to A549 and U937 cells. Peptide 11024 (121VVALSDRATTAYTNTSGVSS140) showed high specific binding to both cell types (dissociation constants of 380 and 800 nm, respectively, and positive receptor-ligand interaction cooperativity), whereas peptide 11033 (284LIGIPVAALIHVYTYRKLSGG304) displayed high binding activity to A549 cells only. Cross-linking assays showed the specific binding of peptide 11024 to a 54 kDa membrane protein on U937. Invasion inhibition assays, in the presence of shared high-activity binding peptide identified for U937 and A549 cells, presented maximum inhibition percentages of 50.53% and 58.27%, respectively. Our work highlights the relevance of the Rv2560 protein in the M. tuberculosis invasion process of monocytes and epithelial cells, and represents a fundamental step in the rational selection of new antigens to be included as components in a multiepitope, subunit-based, chemically synthesized, antituberculosis vaccine."

Methods: Outpatients and inpatients from the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University were included in the study during June 2014 to September 2015. The IPA group had 40 patients, male 22, female 18, aged 55-68 years (mean 60 ), while the control groups included 50 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [male 23, female 27, aged 50-62 years (mean 55 )], 50 patients with lung cancer [male 30, female 20, aged 55-70 years (mean 62)], and 50 healthy controls [male 25, female 25, aged 50-67 years (mean 60) ]. Serum were obtained and the levels of miR-21 and galactomannan (GM test) and (1, 3)-beta-D-glucan (G test) were measured. The related indexes were analyzed by logistic regression and ROC curves. Results: The serum miR-21 expression in IPA and lung cancer patients were increased, the median values (P(25) and P(75)) being 0.42(0.31, 0.62)and 0.80(0.65, 0.94) respectively, both of which were significantly higher than those of the healthy controls [ 0.09(0.04, 0.15)] and the tuberculosis cases [ 0.08(0.03, 0.16)], P<0.001.

The serum levels of miR-21 in between 0.198 and 0.723 had preferable diagnostic accuracy. ROC analysis for miR-21 in IPA compared to healthy controls showed that the AUCs of miR-21 combined with G test or GM test were 0.992 and 0.966 respectively, the sensitivity being 95% (38/40) and 93% (37/40) respectively, the specificity being 98% (49/50) and 96% (48/50) respectively, and the Youden index being 0.930 and 0.885 respectively. If miR-21 was combined with G test and GM test, the AUC was 0.994, the sensitivity and the specificity being 98% (38/40) and 96% (48/50) respectively, and the Youden index increased to 0.935. ROC analysis for miR-21 in IPA compared to tuberculosis cases showed that when miR-21, G test and GM test were combined, the AUC was 0.984, the sensitivity and the specificity being 98% (38/40) and 90% (45/50) respectively, and the Youden index being 0.875. ROC analysis for miR-21 in IPA compared to lung cancer cases showed that the AUC for miR-21 with G test and miR-21 with GM test were 0.948 and 0.979 respectively, the Youden index being 0.725 and 0.895 respectively. When miR-21, G test and GM test were combined, the AUC was 0.998, the sensitivity and the specificity being 100% (40/40) and 98% (49/50) respectively, and the Youden index increased to 0.980. Conclusions: The serum level of miR-21 in IPA and lung cancer patients were significantly elevated. The serum level of miR-21 between 0.198 and 0.723 had preferable differential diagnostic accuracy, and therefore miR-21 may be regarded as an independent potential diagnostic serum marker of IPA. The diagnostic efficiency of miR-21 combined with G test and GM test may be more preferable, and remarkably increase the differential diagnosis of IPA from tuberculosis and lung cancer."

The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years (range, 18-56 years). Investigations consisted of chest radiography, RT 23, serology (for toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and human immunodeficiency virus), and routine blood tests and urinalysis. Examination of vitreous samples consisted of polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and cultures for fungi and bacteria. The results were analyzed 7 days and 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: Analysis of vitreous samples showed cytomegalovirus in 3 patients, herpes simplex virus in 2, tuberculosis in 2, and Candida albicans in 5. All patients had improvement in visual acuity and severity of clinical signs seven days after surgery and in 10 cases after long-term follow-up. Final visual acuity was compromised by chronic macular edema, postinflammatory macular scarring, optic atrophy, subcapsular cataract formation, and capsular opacification after cataract surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Modern laboratory tests are useful for quick and accurate diagnosis of atypical cases of severe infectious posterior uveitis. Early pars plana vitrectomy with silicon oil tamponade is valuable in diagnosing and treating severe infectious posterior uveitis and endophthalmitis."

Blood samples from the ART centers are sent using public transport to a centralized PCR facility. OBJECTIVES: Among HIV-exposed babies <9months at enrolment into IHC program (2013-15), to describe the EID cascade (enrolment, sample collection for PCR, result receipt by mother, HIV diagnosis and ART initiation) and factors associated with delayed (>8weeks of age) or no blood sample collection for EID. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study involving record review. A predictive poisson regression model with robust variance estimates was fitted for risk factors of delayed or no sample collection. RESULTS: Of 1349 babies, 523 (39%) of the babies' mothers were on ART before pregnancy. Timely uptake of EID (<8weeks of age) was 47% (633/1349); sample collection was delayed in 27% (367/1349) and not done in 26% (349/1349) babies. Among samples collected (n=1000), 667 results were received by the mother; 52 (5%) were HIV-infected; among them 42 (81%) were initiated on ART. Median (IQR) turnaround time from sample collection to result receipt by mother and time to initiate ART from result receipt by mother was 7 (4,12) and 8.5 (6,16) weeks, respectively. Mothers not on ART before pregnancy and distance of ART center from PCR facility (more than 128km) were the risk factors of delayed or no sample collection. CONCLUSIONS: Improving provision of ART to mothers (through universal 'test and treat') is urgently required, which has the potential to improve the timely uptake of EID as well. Interventions to reduce turnaround times, like point of care EID testing and/or systematic use of mobile technology to communicate results, are needed."

Three techniques are commercially available: both the Amplicor HIV Monitor and the NASBA HIV-1 RNA QT are target amplification methods, whereas the Quantiplex HIV RNA assay is a branched DNA signal amplification technique. Detection in both target amplification techniques is based on a single primer pair and a single probe in the gag region, whereas multiple probes capture the pol region of the viral RNA in the branched DNA assay. We investigated the discrepant observation of an undetectable viral load in an immunodeficient pregnant HIV-1-infected patient of African origin with no prior antiretroviral treatment. Although clinical progression was present in this patient with tuberculosis and a low CD4 cell count, viral load determinations with both the Amplicor Monitor and NASBA assays revealed no detectable RNA levels. The presence of HIV-1 RNA in the plasma of the patient was demonstrated by an in-house RNA-PCR. Subsequent HIV-1 RNA quantification with the branched DNA method revealed a high viremia (460,000 copies/ml). DNA sequence analysis of the gag gene identified a subtype G HIV-1 strain (HIV-1BL). To our knowledge this is the first report of a patient harboring an HIV-1 genotype of the main group with a high viral load as quantified by the branched DNA assay, but undetectable with the two commercial HIV RNA amplification techniques because of genetic divergence. In the case of discrepant low viral loads determined by one amplification technique in patients with advanced clinical stage one should use an alternative quantification technique for confirmation."

Thus, we analyzed the cellular and molecular components of the resolution phase of non-microbe-induced inflammation. In thioglycollate (TG)-induced peritonitis, resolution started at 12 h (Tmax) and displayed a 22 h resolution interval (Ri). During resolution, lipoxin A4, resolvin (Rv) D1 and RvD2, protectin D1 (PD1), and maresin 1 (MaR1) were transiently produced while RvD5 was continually generated. In addition, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-derived mediators were produced to a higher extent than in microbial peritonitis. We also investigated leukocyte infiltration and clearance in peritoneal tissues surrounding the inflammatory site. In the omentum, resolution parameters, neutrophil apoptosis, and efferocytosis were similar to those of the peritoneal cavity. However, we noticed long-term persistence of M2-polarized macrophages and B-lymphocytes in the omentum after TG administration, whereas zymosan injection caused M1/M2-macrophage and T-lymphocyte persistence regardless of the magnitude of the inflammatory response. Our study indicates that some aspects of resolution are shaped in a stimulus-specific manner, and it ultimately argues that the tissues surrounding the inflammatory site must also be considered to address the inflammatory response globally."

We examined the relative mycobacteriostatic contributions of normal human alveolar macrophages (HAM), peripheral blood monocytes (PBM), and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the early time period after infection with mycobacteria (48 h). Cells were infected with Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) or M. tuberculosis H37Ra and their ability to inhibit growth was determined by mycobacterial incorporation of [3H]uracil. HAM inhibited the growth of both mycobacteria (44.2 +/- 7.9 and 37.6 +/- 10.5% inhibition, respectively). Two populations of HAM donors were subsequently defined: inhibitors and noninhibitors. The ability to inhibit growth of H37Ra correlated with that of BCG. In contrast to HAM, PBM and PMN did not inhibit mycobacterial growth. Because nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed to mediate growth inhibition in murine models, we examined whether NO was responsible for the early growth inhibition of mycobacteria by HAM. As expected, in murine peritoneal macrophages (MPM) IFN-gamma (2,500 U/ml) enhanced growth inhibition of BCG; the effect was abolished by the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NMMA. In contrast, IFN-gamma failed to enhance growth inhibition by HAM or PBM and NMMA had no effect. MPM expressed inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) mRNA in response to LPS and IFN-gamma and produced NO. Neither NOS2 mRNA nor NO could be detected in HAM stimulated with LPS and IFN-gamma or mycobacteria. These data demonstrate that HAM, but not PBM or PMN, have NO-independent mycobacteriostatic activity in the early time period after infection with mycobacteria."

The decision to institute treatment of the patients should be made after a period of follow up, because therapy is often prolonged, and frequently ineffective. The reasons why some patients develop severe NTM diseases are not clear. Here we observed the involvement of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in clinical and laboratory features of NTM diseases. We evaluated various tuberculosis-related inflammatory markers including osteopontin (OPN), pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) in NTM infected patients with or without LTBI. Eight NTM and 5 tuberculosis (TB) patients, and 5 healthy subjects were enrolled. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis confirmed the absence of tuberculosis specific gene (RD1 region), among clinical isolates from NTM patients. Interferon- (IFN-) release assay (IGRA) using Early Secreted Antigenic Target-6 (ESAT-6) and CFP-10, the RD1-encoded protein, was employed for determining LTBI. IGRA was positive in 4/8 NTM (NTM with LTBI, 50%) and 5/5 TB patients. Only 2 of 4 NTM with LTBI were under chemotherapy among all NTM patients, and others were followed up. The plasma levels of OPN, PTX3 and sIL-2R were significantly higher in NTM patients with LTBI than in those without LTBI (P < 0.05). The two patients under therapy showed the highest OPN levels that persisted after treatment. The increased inflammatory levels in NTM patients with LTBI indicate enhanced inflammatory reaction. Extensive therapy may be necessary in such patients."

The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of CMV detection in blood and organ-specific biological material, such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), by comparing two standard diagnostic methods, immunofluorescence (IF) and the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We evaluated 25 patients with concomitant respiratory disease who were referred to our hospital for diagnosis due to suspected acute CMV infection. The presence of hCMV was concomitantly evaluated by IF and PCR in 16 peripheral blood samples. In two patients, we observed positive results for both IF and PCR, and in two other patients the results were discordant. Of 11 patients, CMV DNA was detected in six BALF samples, and in one blood plasma sample. Real-time PCR detected CMV DNA in 54.6% of BALF samples and 12.0% of blood samples, while indirect IF testing confirmed antigenemia in 12.5% of blood samples. The results from our study suggest that the IF method is as effective as PCR for detecting an ongoing CMV infection in blood samples. However, real-time PCR was much more effective at detecting CMV DNA in BALF compared to blood samples. Our results suggest that the biological material being tested during CMV diagnosis should be derived directly from the virally infected organ(s)."

The total of 33 examined persons were divided in two groups: 1) 13 persons seropositive for HIV; and 2) 20 healthy persons - randomly selected blood donors that made the case control group. The subjects age was between 25 and 52 years (average 38,5). ELFA test for combined detection of HIV p24 antigen and anti HIV-1+2 IgG and ELISA test for detection of antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2, were performed for each examined person. RNA from the whole blood was extracted using a commercial kit based on salt precipitation. Detection of HIV RNA was performed using RT-PCR kit. Following nested PCR, the product was separated by electrophoresis in 1,5 % agarose gel. The result was scored positive if the band of 210bp was visible regardless of intensity. Measures of precaution were taken during all the steps of the work and HIV infected materials were disposed of accordingly. In the group of blood donors ELFA, ELISA and RT-PCR were negative. Assuming that prevalence of HIV infection is zero, the clinical specificity of RT-PCR is 100 %. The analytical specificity of RT-PCR method was tested against Hepatitis C and B, Human Papiloma Virus, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus, Rubella Virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia trachomatis. None of these templates yielded amplicon. In the group of 13 seropositive persons, 33 samples were analyzed. HIV RNA was detected in 15 samples. ELISA and ELFA test were positive in all samples. Different aliquots of the samples were tested independently and showed the same results. After different periods of storing the RNA samples at -70 masculineC, RT-PCR reaction was identical to the one performed initially. The obtained amplicons were maintained frozen at -20 masculineC for a week and the subsequently performed electrophoresis was identical to the previous one. The reaction is fast, simple for manipulation; with low detection level of 60 IU/ml. RT-PCR needs a small amount of RNA, as well as a small volume of sample. HIV RNA was detected in different periods of time with different clinical presentations in patients, with or without antiretroviral therapy. RT-PCR method gives the opportunity for reliable determination of HIV-1 RNA with border of detection of 60 IU/ml. The test is reproducible and has high analytical and clinical specificity."

The PCR product is analyzed in a reverse cross blot hybridization assay with probes specific for M. tuberculosis complex (pTub1), M. avium (pAvi3), M. intracellulare (pInt5 and pInt7), M. kansasii complex-M. scrofulaceum complex (pKan1), M. xenopi (pXen1), M. fortuitum (pFor1), M. smegmatis (pSme1), and Mycobacterium spp. (pMyc5a). The PCR assay can detect 10 fg of DNA, the equivalent of two mycobacteria. The specificities of the probes were tested with 108 mycobacterial strains (33 species) and 31 nonmycobacterial strains (of 17 genera). The probes pAvi3, pInt5, pInt7, pKan1, pXen1, and pMyc5a were specific. With probes pTub1, pFor1, and pSme1, slight cross hybridization occurred. However, the mycobacterial strains from which the cross-hybridizing PCR products were derived belonged to nonpathogenic or nonopportunistic species which do not occur in clinical samples. The test was used on 31 different clinical specimens obtained from patients suspected of having mycobacterial disease, including a patient with a double mycobacterial infection. The samples included sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tissue biopsy samples, cerebrospinal fluid, pus, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, and blood. The results of the PCR assay agreed with those of conventional identification methods or with clinical data, showing that the test can be used for the direct and rapid detection and identification of mycobacteria in clinical samples."

We also studied the induction of HBD-2 gene expression by mannose lipoarabinomannan (manLAM) from M. tuberculosis. Intracellular production of HBD-2 peptide was detected by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. Our results demonstrated that there was induction of HBD-2 mRNA in A549 cells after infection with M. tuberculosis at various multiplicities of infection (MOI) and that there was stimulation with manLAM. AM expressed the HBD-2 gene only at a high MOI with M. tuberculosis. MN did not express HBD-2 at any of the experimental M. tuberculosis MOI. Immunostaining revealed the presence of intracellular HBD-2 peptide in A549 cells following infection with M. tuberculosis, and the staining was more intense in areas where there were M. tuberculosis clusters. By using electron microscopy we also demonstrated production of HBD-2 after M. tuberculosis infection and adherence of HBD-2 to the membranes of M. tuberculosis. Alveolar epithelial cells are among the first cells to encounter M. tuberculosis following aerogenic infection. As HBD-2 has been shown to control growth of M. tuberculosis and has chemotactic activity, our results suggest that HBD-2 induction by M. tuberculosis may have a role in the pathogenesis of human tuberculosis."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intravesical BCG immunotherapy was given to 22 consecutive patients with superficial bladder tumors. In 2 patients the BCG instillation had to be discontinued due to serious side effects of therapy. Blood samples (252 aliquots) were obtained from 126 BCG courses in 22 cases, and 2 additional samples (4 aliquots) were obtained from 1 patient 1 and 3 months after cessation of therapy. All blood samples were analyzed by the PCR technique for detection of deoxyribonucleic acid tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis. RESULTS: Of the 126 blood samples 9 (7.1%) were PCR positive for M. tuberculosis. These 9 positive samples belonged to 3 patients, all of whom were among those 4 patients who had major clinical side effects. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that rapid and sensitive detection of mycobacteremia by PCR correlated with the clinical course of these patients. We also demonstrated that PCR can be used to monitor BCG in the blood after antituberculous therapy. The early, fast and accurate diagnosis of BCG in the blood by PCR may alter the serious clinical course of these patients by initiation of specific treatment early. However, further extensive studies are needed to validate these results."

Part I: Techniques for direct detection and identification of Brucella spp.,0,"Brucellosis is a world-wide re-emerging zoonosis and the most frequent laboratory-acquired bacterial infection, causing severe disease in humans with unspecific clinical signs affecting numerous organs. Contact with infected animals, ingestion of contaminated animal products and handling of Brucella isolates in laboratories are risk factors. Various other febrile illnesses, e.g. malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid fever and tularemia may present with the same symptoms. Therefore, clinical diagnosis is difficult to establish but effective therapy requires an early diagnosis. Vaccines for humans are still not commercially available. Blood culturing of Brucella is time-consuming and not reliable. Thus diagnosis is usually based on indirect serological tests, i.e. serum agglutination test, complement fixation or the Coombs test. However, these 'conventional' serological tests lack sensitivity and specificity. Hence, a combination of various tests is mandatory for a definite diagnosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays can be used for screening and confirmation of brucellosis in one step. Molecular techniques like the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism are needed to differentiate species and strains within the genus Brucella. This review will summarize advantages and disadvantages of the techniques used in clinical laboratories for direct detection and identification of Brucella spp."

The larger set, representing 40-80% of all blood gamma/delta cells, is comprised of cells bearing the V gamma 9/C gamma 1 chain. Cells in the smaller, included set have an additional requirement for V delta 2 (and probably for certain permissive junctional regions, since a very small percentage of V gamma 9/V delta 2 cells do not react against mycobacteria-pulsed APC). Optimal stimulation by mycobacteria is dependent on the presence of APC, and is not restricted by classical major histocompatibility complex molecules. Some of the V gamma 9/V delta 2 mycobacteria-specific clones are also stimulated by APC pulsed with different bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli, indicating that the population includes several different patterns of reactivity.

DNA extracted from 84 DBS samples from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients was genotyped for AAT deficiency variants by real-time PCR. The results of DBS AAT genotyping were validated by serum IEF phenotyping and AAT concentration measurement. The proposed protocol allowed successful DNA extraction from all analyzed DBS samples. Both quantity and quality of DNA were sufficient for further real-time PCR and, if necessary, for genetic sequence analysis. A 100% concordance between AAT DBS genotypes and serum phenotypes in positive detection of two major deficiency S- and Z- alleles was achieved. Both assays, DBS AAT genotyping by real-time PCR and serum AAT phenotyping by IEF, positively identified PI*S and PI*Z allele in 8 out of the 84 (9.5%) and 16 out of 84 (19.0%) patients, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed protocol noticeably reduces the costs and the hand-on-time of DBS samples preparation providing genomic DNA of sufficient quantity and quality for further real-time PCR or genetic sequence analysis. Consequently, it is ideally suited for large-scale AAT deficiency screening programs and should be method of choice."

Itchy red papules that evolved to crusty lesions and subsequently showed varioliform atrophic scarring appeared over the face, extensor surface of the arms, back, thighs, and scalp (Figs 1 and 2). Her history included weight loss of 8.kg, but no other associated symptoms or contact with tuberculosis patients. The blood count showed a normochromic-normocytic anemia with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) slightly elevated at 28 mm in the first hour (normal, < 20 mm). Tuberculin skin test was positive (13 mm with necrotic reaction) and anti-human immunodeficiency virus serology was negative. Four lesional skin biopsies and one lymph node biopsy were performed and sent for histopathology and culture. The skin biopsy showed small-vessel lumen occlusion by tiny thrombi, endothelial hyperplasia, and intense perivascular inflammatory reaction throughout the dermis, together with partial degeneration of collagen, compatible with tuberculid. Lymph node biopsy showed chronic, necrotizing, granulomatous lymphadenitis, consistent with a diagnosis of lymph node tuberculosis. Mycobacteria were absent on Ziehl-Neelsen staining and culture in all specimens. On the basis of the clinical features, positive tuberculin skin test, and histopathologic findings, a diagnosis of papulonecrotic tuberculid associated with tuberculous lymphadenitis was made. A triple therapeutic regimen with rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide was started and the patient evolved with progressive clinical improvement. At the end of treatment at 6 months, there was clinical remission and improvement of anemia and ESR. Four months later, however, there was a clinical relapse of the lesions on the scalp, ultimately resulting in cicatricial alopecia with varioliform atrophic scarring (Figs 3 and 4). A biopsy of these new lesions was performed and showed focal necrosis (V-shaped) in the epidermis and dermis with follicular involvement and thrombotic occlusion of vessels, confirming the diagnosis of tuberculid. The patient was retreated with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 9 months. A new investigation of another internal focus of tuberculosis was negative.

Diagnostic culture, considered as the reference method, was performed with BACTEC, Lwenstein-Jensen, Stonebrink, and Kirchner media. Occasionally MB-Redox, ESP, or MGIT medium was also used. A total of 643 respiratory and 506 nonrespiratory specimens collected from 807 patients were investigated. Of the 95 culture-positive specimens, 80 were COBAS AMPLICOR MTB positive, and of the 1,054 culture-negative specimens, 1,044 were COBAS AMPLICOR MTB negative. After resolving discrepancies by review of the medical history, the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the COBAS AMPLICOR MTB assay, respectively, were 83.5, 98.8, 86.7, and 98.6% compared to those of diagnostic culture. In smear-positive specimens, the sensitivity of the COBAS AMPLICOR MTB assay was 96%, versus 48% for smear-negative specimens. No significant differences in the test performance between respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens were observed. The overall inhibition rate was less than 2%, excluding stool specimens. The clear advantages of the COBAS AMPLICOR PCR system are standardized procedures and reagents for specimen processing as well as an internal control for reliable monitoring of PCR inhibitors. By simplifying the work flow through a completely automated amplification and amplicon detection procedure, the COBAS AMPLICOR PCR system proved itself as a very useful component for routine diagnostic procedures."

Induced levels of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) were compared among groups of individuals representing three phases of immunity to infection with M. tuberculosis: naive normal control subjects, purified protein derivative (PPD)-reactive normal donors, and individuals with active tuberculosis (TB [diseased]). Levels of IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA in cocultured cells from TB patients were 51 and 45%, respectively, of those obtained in cells from sensitized healthy volunteers and were comparable to those from naive normal donors. Lymphoproliferative responses to M. tuberculosis and induction of the T-cell cytokine IL-2 were predictably high in the cells of PPD-sensitized donors, low in normal naive individuals, and variable among TB patients. In contrast, the induced level of another lymphokine, IFN-gamma, did not follow the pattern seen in IL-2 induction. Infection with live M. tuberculosis induced high levels of IFN-gamma mRNA in lymphocytes of both PPD-sensitized and normal naive donors compared with those of TB patients. Interestingly, polyclonal stimulation with the mitogen concanavalin A induced similar IFN-gamma levels in cells from all three donor groups. The high level of IFN-gamma induced by the infection of monocytes from naive normal donors suggests a role for natural killer (NK) cells in the production of IFN-gamma in this coculture system. This response appears independent of the role performed by T cells."

Due to the limited accuracy of the current TB diagnostic tests, it is critical to determine novel biomarkers for this disease. Circulating exosomes have been used as diagnostic biomarkers in various diseases. OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: In this pilot study, we examined the expression of miRNAs as biomarker candidates for the diagnosis of TB infection. METHODS: Serum-derived exosomes were isolated from TB patients and matched control subjects. The expression of miR-484, miR-425, and miR-96 was examined by RT-PCR methods. RESULTS: The expression of miR-484, miR-425, and miR-96 were significantly increased in serum of TB patients which correlated with the TB infection level. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed the diagnostic potency of each individual serum exosomal miRNA with an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.72 for miR-484 (p < 0.05), 0.66 for miR-425 (p < 0.05), and 0.62 for miR-96 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that exosomal miRNAs have diagnostic potential in active tuberculosis. The diagnostic power may be improved when combined with conventional diagnostic markers."

The 4 cases of agranulocytosis were as follows. CASE 1: A 51-year-old woman with right chest pain and fever was admitted to our hospital on Jan 4, 2001. The white blood cell (WBC) count was 5,200/microliter. The tubercle bacilli were cultured in her sputum. The treatment with INH 0.3, RFP 0.45, EB 0.75, PZA 1.2 g/day, allopurinol and teprenone was started on Jan 13. Pyrazinamide and allopurinol were stopped because of hyper-uric acidemia on Feb 7. Agranulocytosis and eosinophilia (WBC 1,300 [Neut 1%, Ly 57%, Eos 35%]) developed on Feb 13. All drugs were withdrawn and G-CSF drug nartograstim 100 micrograms was injected subcutaneously for 3 days. The WBC recovered to normal level and she was thereafter treated with INH, EB and Levofloxacin (LVFX) without any further trouble. Agranulocytosis in this case was supposed to be due to RFP. CASE 2: A 66-year-old man who had had nephrotic syndrome and hypothyroidism and has been treated with prednisolone 10 mg/day was admitted to our hospital on Aug 9, 2000 because of miliary tuberculosis. The tubercle bacilli were cultured in his sputum and the treatment with INH 0.3, RFP 0.45, and EB 0.75 g/day were started on Aug 10, but it was withdrawn on Aug 17 because of general skin eruption. After re-starting treatment with EB and INH on Aug 24, RFP was added in small dosage (0.05 g) on Oct 12, but agranulomatosis (WBC 2,300/microliter [Neut 2%]) developed on Nov 21, and all drugs were withdrawn again. The G-CSF drug filgrastim was used once subcutaneously, and WBC recovered immediately. He was thereafter treated with INH, EB, LVFX successfully. Agranulocytosis was supposed to be due to RFP. CASE 3: A 60-year-old woman without symptoms had abnormal chest roentgenograph, and consulted with our hospital on Aug 26, 2002. The broncho-alveolar lavage fluid was smear and culture-negative, but PCR-TB positive, and the case was diagnosed as pulmonary tuberculosis. Treatment with INH 0.3, RFP 0.45, EB 0.75, PZA 1.2 g/day, alloprinol 300 mg and rebamipide 300 mg/day was started on Sept. 5, 2002. Late in September, she complained of appetite loss. The laboratory data on Oct 3 revealed WBC 900/microliter (Neut 1%, Ly 94%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 199 IU/l, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 253 IU/l, showing agranulocytosis and drug-induced hepatitis. The chemotherapy was immediately withdrawn and she was admitted to our hospital on the next day. Glycyrrhizin derivative (SNMC) 40 ml was injected for 5 days, and WBC recovered, and AST and ALT also became normal. CASE 4: A 60-year-old man was admitted to our hospital on March 11, 1981 because pulmonary tuberculosis had recurred. He had been treated with SM, PAS and INH in 1973 for pulmonary tuberculosis. On admission examination of blood count and blood chemistry were normal. Treatment with RFP, INH and SM was started on March 11. He stopped out from the hospital on April 17, but in a few days he returned back with sore throat, lower lip swelling and gingival bleeding. Blood cell count on April 24 showed pancytopenia with RBC 226, Hb 7.5, WBC 800 (Ly 96%, Eos 4%) and Plt 10,000/microliter. The bone-marrow showed NCC (nuceated cell count) of 5,500, and megakaryocyte 0. Thereafter ground glass appearance shadows were seen on the whole lung field, and he died May 26. Autopsy showed generalized aspergillosis. It was strongly suspected that either of RFP, INH or SM was responsible for his pancytopenia. We collected another 10 cases of agranulocytosis due to anti-tuberculosis drugs in the world wide literature, and found men/women ratio 5/8 (in one case gender was not known), the duration of chemotherapy before appearance of agranulocytosis 1-3 months, no change in the lymphocyte count of the peripheral blood, and the accompanying of another allergic signs such as skin eruption, blood eosinophilia or drug-induced hepatitis in some cases, and these findings suggest that the mechanism of agranulocytosis due to anti-tuberculosis drugs was allergic in nature."

Early infant diagnosis with dried blood spot testing was provided by the National AIDS Programme in Thailand from 2007. We report ART initiation and vital status in children with HIV after 7 years of rollout in Thailand. METHODS: Dried blood spot samples were collected from HIV-exposed children in hospitals in Thailand and mailed to the Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, where HIV DNA was assessed with real-time PCR to establish HIV infection. We linked data from children with an HIV infection to the National AIDS Programme database to ascertain ART and vital status. FINDINGS: Between April 5, 2007, and Oct 1, 2014, 16046 dried blood spot samples were sent from 8859 children in 364 hospitals in Thailand. Median age at first dried blood spot test was 21 (IQR 18-25) months. Of 7174 (81%) children with two or more samples, 223 (3%) were HIV positive (including five unconfirmed). Of 1685 (19%) children with one sample, 70 (4%) were unconfirmed positive. Of 293 (3%) children who were HIV positive, 220 (75%) registered for HIV care and 170 (58%) initiated ART. Median age at ART initiation decreased from 142 months (IQR 102-256) in 2007 to 61 months (42-92) in 2013, and the number of children initiating ART aged younger than 1 year increased from five (33%) of 15 children initiating ART in 2007 to ten (83%) of 12 initiating ART in 2013. 15 (9%) of 170 children who initiated ART died and 16 (32%) of 50 who had no ART record died. INTERPRETATION: Early infant diagnosis with dried blood spot testing had high uptake in primary care settings. Further improvement of linkage to HIV care is needed to ensure timely treatment of all children with an HIV infection. FUNDING: None."

Here, we examined the role of IFN-alpha/beta in the murine response to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, using wildtype mice, mice with impaired signaling through the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), and mice treated to reduce levels of type I IFNs. In this study, we used virulent clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, including HN878, W4, and CDC1551. Our results indicate that higher levels of type I IFNs are induced by the HN878 and W4 strains. Induction of type I IFNs was associated with lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin- 12 (IL-12) and reduced T cell activation, and associated with decreased survival of the mice infected with HN878 or W4 relative to infection with CDC1551. Infection of mice with HN878 and W4 was also associated with relatively higher levels of mRNA for a number of negative regulators of the Jak-Stat signaling pathway, such as suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1, 4, and 5, CD45, protein inhibitor of activated Stat1 (PIAS1), protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 1 (Ptpn1), and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type substrate 1 (Ptpns1). Taken together, these results suggest that increased type I IFNs may be deleterious for survival of M. tuberculosis-infected mice in association with reduced Th1 immunity."

OBJECTIVE.: To illustrate the usefulness of broad-range bacterial polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing in osteoarticular infections by Capnocytophaga canimorsus. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: C. canimorsus is a Gram-negative bacillus that was first identified in 1976. It is a normal inhabitant of the oral mucosa of dogs (26%) and cats (15%). The main clinical patterns are septicemia, which may cause fatal septic shock (in 30% of cases) but arthritis and discitis are possible. C. canimorsus is susceptible to many antimicrobials including -lactam antibiotics. METHODS.: About a case report of 54-year-old man transferred to our institution for discitis, we discuss about PCR for C. canimorsus discitis diagnosis. RESULTS.: At admission, the only abnormal physical finding was global pain and stiffness of the lumbar spine. Radiographs of the lumbar spine and pelvis showed lumbar spondylosis, degenerative disc disease, and previously known degenerative facet joint disease. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated L3-L4 discitis with damage to both vertebrae and adjacent discs. Findings were negative from blood and urine cultures, serological tests for the HIV and brucellosis, and sputum tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A percutaneous biopsy of the L3-L4 disc was performed but the bacteriological studies recovered no organisms. A second needle biopsy was performed for broad-range 16S rDNA PCR testing, which identified C. canimorsus. CONCLUSION.: Broad-range PCR provided the microbiological diagnosis of culture-negative discitis in our patient. Broad-range PCR should be considered in patients with culture-negative osteoarticular infections.  2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

METHODS: Twenty individuals with uveitis of presumed infectious origin were evaluated. Sixteen of them had AIDS, four were immunocompetent individuals. We also evaluated 4 normal controls who underwent vitrectomy surgery. Clinical evaluation of the patients was performed together by three clinicians. PCR evaluations of the serum, aqueous, and vitreous humor were performed in a masked fashion by the laboratory staff. RESULTS: Twelve patients had a clinical diagnosis of CMV retinitis. Of these 6 (50%) had a positive PCR for CMV in the vitreous, three (25%) had a positive PCR for CMV in the serum, and none were positive in the aqueous. Five patients had a clinical diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN). Three (60%) of these had positive PCR for HSV/VZV in the vitreous. One of these patients had a positive PCR reaction for both EBV and HSV/VZV in the vitreous samples. One patient with cutaneous herpes zoster had a positive PCR reaction for HSV/VZV in the serum. Four patients had a presumed diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis, one patient (25%) had a positive PCR for Toxoplasma gondii in the serum, 3 (75%) had positive results in the aqueous, and 2 (50%) had positive results in the vitreous. One patient with presumed ocular tuberculosis had a positive PCR reaction both in the serum and in the vitreous samples. Finally, none of the four control individuals revealed any positive PCR reaction.

Recent comparative genomics have revealed the presence of 165 M. leprae genes with no homologue in M. tuberculosis. We selected 17 of these genes for further study. All 17 genes were found to be expressed at the mRNA level in M. leprae from infected mice and from a multibacillary leprosy patient. Additional comparative genomic analyses of all currently available mycobacterial genome databases confirmed 12 candidate genes to be unique to M. leprae, whereas 5 genes had homologues in mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis. Evaluation of the immunogenicity of all 17 recombinant proteins in PBMC from 127 Brazilians showed that five antigens (ML0576, ML1989, ML1990, ML2283, and ML2567) induced significant gamma interferon levels in paucibacillary leprosy patients, reactional leprosy patients, and exposed healthy controls but not in most multibacillary leprosy patients, tuberculosis patients, or endemic controls. Importantly, among exposed healthy controls 71% had no detectable immunoglobulin M antibodies to the M. leprae-specific PGL-I but responded to one or more M. leprae antigen(s). Collectively, the M. leprae proteins identified are expressed at the transcriptome level and can efficiently activate T cells of M. leprae-exposed individuals. These proteins may provide new tools to develop tests for specific diagnosis of M. leprae infection and may enhance our understanding of leprosy and its transmission."

The aim of the present study was to set up a highly specific, sensitive, and reproducible home-brewed Real-time PCR assay based on TaqMan chemistry to quantify HIV-1 RNA genome. Methods In this study, three sets of primer pairs and a TaqMan probe were designed for HIV subtypes conserved sequences. An internal control was included in this assay to evaluate the presence of inhibition. Standard curve and threshold cycle values were determined using in vitro transcribed RNA from int region of HIV-1. A serial dilution of RNA standards was generated by in vitro transcription, from 10 to 10(9) copies/ml to find the sensitivity and the limit of detection (LOD) of the assay and to evaluate its performance in a quantitative RT-PCR assay. Results The assay has a low LOD equivalent to 33.13copies/ml of HIV-1 RNA and a linear range of detection from 10 to 10(9) copies/ml. The coefficient of variation (CV) for Inter and Intra-assay precision of this in-house HIV Real-time RT-PCR ranged from 0.28 to 2.49% and 0.72 to 4.47%, respectively.

In the present work Mtb mutants: Rv-78 with overexpression of mtrA and Rv-129 with elevated level of phosphorylation-defective MtrA were used for further investigation of the potential influence of the MtrAB system on Mtb interaction with human monocytes. MATERIAL/METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of MHC class II molecules. The expression of genes for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cathepsin G was quantified by RT-PCR. The association of Mtb strains with Rab5 and Rab7 positive vacuoles was investigated applying confocal microscopy. IL-10 and IL-12 secretion by monocytes as well as the Mtb susceptibility to cathepsin G were investigated. RESULTS: Mutation-carried and wild type Mtb strains inhibited MHC class II expression on monocytes to a similar extent. Monocyte stimulation with mycobacteria led to the increased production of IL-10 but no detectable amounts of IL-12 or NO were observed. Expression of the gene for iNOS was not detected while that for cathepsin G was shown, however its intensity was not associated with MtrA mutation. Mtb mutant strains were more effectively enclosed in phagosomes containing the late endosome marker Rab7 as compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: The results may confirm the importance of the MtrAB system in mycobacterial capacity for successful survival in phagocytes, especially in the context of high degree of colocalization of Mtb Rv-78 to mature phagosomes."

During the past decade, new types of antimicrobial resistance have emerged, some of which present new challenges for the clinical microbiology laboratory. In most cases, conventional culture-based testing methods continue to be useful. In other situations in which the organism responsible for infection grows slowly (for example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), culture methods are technically difficult (such as for human immunodeficiency virus), or genotypes are inconsistently expressed (for instance, methicillin resistance in staphylococci), genetic susceptibility testing methods may offer special advantages. Determining serum concentrations of antimicrobial agents may be useful both to ensure adequacy of treatment and to prevent toxicity. In this review, methods are described for conventional and genetic tests used to guide antimicrobial therapy."

Out of them, in only a few cases the diagnosis was properly made with a proof of the microscopic presence of Toxoplasma gondii. This is the first report of toxoplasma pericarditis in which the presence of Toxoplasma gondii was detected by polymerase chain reaction of pericardial effusion. In addition, the previous reports will be reviewed, and compared to this present case. A 29-year-old woman, without immunosuppressant disorder, suffering from fever and orthopnea was admitted to our hospital. Blood chemistry findings indicated mild liver dysfunction and inflammation. Chest radiography showed cardiac enlargement. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia and ST elevation. Echocardiography revealed a massive pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis demonstrated 638 ml of bloody fluid. Cytologic study of the fluid was class II for malignancy, and polymerase chain reaction to tuberculosis was negative. However, a high titer of the anti-toxoplasma antibody of 1: 20,480 (passive hemagglutination) indicated pericarditis caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Subsequently, Toxoplasma gondii was identified in the pericardial effusion by polymerase chain reaction. Clinical symptoms improved after pericardiocentesis, but 2 months later pericarditis recurred. Treatment was started with 800 mg acetylspiramycin daily but failed to improve the symptoms. Because of the development of pleuritis, treatment was changed to sulfadoxine 1,000 mg/pyrimethamine 50 mg. After the treatment with them, her symptoms improved. Only 22 cases of toxoplasma pericarditis have been reported worldwide and 15 of those cases were without immunosuppressant disorder. The usual symptoms at the onset of pericarditis without immunosuppressant disorder are fever, dyspnea and chest pain. Seven patients developed cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was performed in 8 cases and the pericardial fluid was hemorrhagic in 6. Pericardial thickening was detected in 5 cases. The diagnosis of toxoplasma infection is very difficult, because asymptomatic infection of Toxoplasma gondii is very common. Pericarditis is a disease difficult to confirm the etiology. Detection of Toxoplasma gondii in pericardial effusion by the polymerase chain reaction is very useful for its diagnosis."

The samples from patients with brucellosis were paired to an equal number of control samples from the same locations of patients whose illnesses had different etiologies. Thirty-three of the 34 nonblood samples (97%) from the brucellosis patients were positive by PCR, whereas Brucella spp. were isolated from only 29.4% of the conventional cultures. For 11.4% of the patients, the confirmatory serological tests were either negative or showed titers below the diagnostic range. Two patients (6.2%) from the control group, both with tuberculous vertebral osteomyelitis, had a positive PCR result. The brucella PCR of blood from these two patients was also positive, and the two strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated were analyzed by the brucella PCR, with no evidence of amplification. These results show that the PCR assay is far more sensitive than conventional cultures, and this, coupled with its speed and reduction in risk to laboratory workers, makes this technique a very useful tool for the diagnosis of focal complications of brucellosis."

METHODS: We designed a molecular-based PCR method for the evaluation of rifabutin (RFB) and rifampicin (RIF) resistance based on probable determinant regions within the rpoB gene of MAP, including the 81 bp variable site located between nucleotides 1363 and 1443. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for RIF was also determined against 11 MAP isolates in attempt to seek correlation with rpoB sequences. RESULTS: We determined that MAP strain 18 had an MIC of > 30 mg/L and <or= 5 mg/L for RIF and RFB respectively, and a significant and novel rpoB mutation C1367T, compared to an MIC of <or= 1.0 mg/L for both drugs in the wild type MAP. The 30-fold increase in the MIC was a direct result of the rpoB mutation C1367T, which caused an amino acid change Thr456 to Ile456 in the drug's binding site; the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. In addition, MAP strain 185 contained five silent rpoB mutations and exhibited an MIC comparable to the wild-type. Moreover, our in vitro selected mutation in MAP strain UCF5 resulted in the generation of a new resistant strain (UCF5-RIF16r) that possessed T1442C rpoB mutation and an MIC > 30 mg/L and > 10 mg/L for RIF and RFB respectively. Sequencing of the entire rpoB gene in MAP strains UCF4, 18, and UCF5-RIF16r revealed an rpoB mutation A2284C further downstream of the 81 bp variable region in UCF4, accounting for observed slight increase in MIC. In addition, no other significant mutations were found in strains 18 and UCF-RIF16r. CONCLUSION: The data clearly illustrates that clinical and in vitro-selected MAP mutants with rpoB mutations result in resistance to RIF and RFB, and that a single amino acid change in the beta subunit may have a significant impact on RIF resistance. Unconventional drug susceptibility testing such as our molecular approach will be beneficial for evaluation of antibiotic effectiveness. This molecular approach may also serve as a model for other drugs used for treatment of MAP infections."

The fine needle aspiration cytological (FNAC) features of GM have rarely been discussed in the literature. These features are reported in eight histologically confirmed cases of GM. METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken in which a diagnosis of GM had been made on histopathology, and the FNAC slides were reviewed and assessed for the presence of granulomas, necrosis, multinucleated giant cells, and inflammatory background cells. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was performed on the histological material to exclude tuberculosis. RESULTS: All cases were confirmed histologically and PCR for mycobacterial DNA was negative. In the FNACs, varying numbers of granulomas composed of epithelioid histiocytes were present in four cases. The same four cases showed giant cells of either foreign body or Langhan's type. No necrosis was noted. Six cases showed many histiocytes, some plump and others epithelioid, in the background. The number of epithelioid histiocytes corresponded to the presence of granulomas. Neutrophils were the predominant background inflammatory cells in most cases (six). CONCLUSIONS: The cytological diagnosis of GM is difficult because the features overlap with other aetiologies, including tuberculosis. Specific features are absent. The absence of necrosis and a predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate in the background favour a diagnosis of GM. This diagnosis should also be considered when abundant epithelioid histiocytes are seen in smears, even in the absence of granulomas. However, the definitive diagnosis of GM depends on histology from fine needle biopsies and negative microbiological investigations."

The assay was used to evaluate paired whole blood and trunk-wash samples obtained from the 5 elephants during a 15-week period. Deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing and viral gene subtyping analysis were performed on trunk-wash DNA preparations that had positive results for EEHV1. Viral gene subtypes were compared with those associated with past fatal cases of herpesvirus-associated disease within the herd. Results - The PCR assay detected viral DNA to a level of 1,200 copies/mL of whole blood. It was used to detect EEHV1 in trunk secretions of 3 of the 5 elephants surveyed during the 15-week period. Viral gene subtyping analysis identified 2 distinct elephant herpesviruses, 1 of which was identical to the virus associated with a previous fatal case of herpesvirus-associated disease within the herd.

The genes encoding these two proteins were well conserved, having 82% DNA identity and 90% identity at the amino acid level. Moreover both proteins, purified from the fast-growing host M. smegmatis, formed multimeric complexes of around 1000 kDa in size and were antigenically related as assessed through their recognition by antibodies and T cells from M. leprae-infected individuals.

By employing anisotropic nonspherical and positively charged gold nanorods (Au-NRs) as the recognition platform, which show high stability against aggregation under high ionic strength conditions without any additional stable reagent, we found that the addition of target DNA to the mixture of nonmodified Au-NRs suspension and label-free probe DNA in high ionic strength buffer leads to a color change from red to light purple in less than 5 min, displaying strong plasmon resonance light scattering (PRLS) signals. Mechanism investigations showed that the strong PRLS signals should be ascribed to the aggregation of Au-NRs induced by the formed double-stranded oligonucleotides (dsDNA) from the hybridization of target DNA with probe DNA. With the PRLS signals, we monitored the hybridization process of a 21-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide (ssDNA) from the HIV-1 U5 long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence with its complementary oligonucleotide and detected the effect of single-base-pair mismatches. Two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon artificial samples derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis glmS and genes encoding for Bacillus glucanase and an HIV-1 LTR sample isolated from HIV-1-positive blood were detected with satisfactory results, showing that the present method has simplicity, sensitivity, specificity, and reliability for sequence-specific DNA detection related to the HIV gene."

However little is known about the regulation of these chemokine receptor axes by Der p 1-pulsed dendritic cells in house dust mite (HDM)-sensitive and non-atopic asthmatics. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the modulatory effects of Der p 1-pulsed DCs on the expression of CCR3 and CCR4 on CD4+ T cells of HDM-sensitive and non-atopic asthmatics. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Using real-time RT-PCR and flow cytometry analysis, the expression of CCR3 and CCR4 were assessed in autologous CD4+ T cells after co-incubation with Der p 1-pulsed DCs from these two asthmatic groups. We also determined the mRNA expression of CCR4 ligands TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 in monocyte-derived DCs after Der p 1 pulsation. RESULTS: We performed flow cytometry analysis of CD4+ T cells from HDM-sensitive and non-atopic asthmatics, taken 24 and 48 h after co-incubation with Der p 1-pulsed DCs. We demonstrated that after co-incubation, there was a significant increase in CCR3+ and CCR4+ CD4+ T cells from HDM-sensitive asthmatics, which began to occur at 24 h and 48 h respectively, and corresponded to their expression at mRNA levels. In contrast, only CCR4 mRNA but not protein expression was increased in non-atopic CD4+ T cells. After Der p 1 pulsation, mRNA expression of CCR4-specific ligands (CCL17 and CCL22) was also markedly upregulated in HDM-sensitive DCs whereas only CCL17 gene expression was increased in non-atopic DCs. CONCLUSION: These data support the role of DCs in differential regulation of CCR3 and CCR4 on CD4+ T cells from HDM-sensitive and non-atopic asthmatics after Der p 1 exposure."

Different epidemiological risk factors are associated with the transmission of the causative agents, Bartonella henselae and B. quintana. Vulval BA is described rarely. Two patients presented with a vulval mass (Patient 1) and a verrucous vulval growth (Patient 2), which were diagnosed clinically as tuberculosis and carcinoma, respectively. Patient 1 also had pulmonary tuberculosis and Kaposi sarcoma. Biopsy of the vulval lesions confirmed BA, characterized by a multilobular proliferation of blood vessels that were lined by epithelioid endothelial cells. There were prominent intervascular neutrophils, karyorrhectic debris, and clumps of paravascular argyrophilic organisms. The biopsy from Patient 1 was deep dermal/subcutaneous in location and displayed foci of confluent suppuration. There was florid pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia in the biopsy from Patient 2. Molecular investigations confirmed intralesional B. quintana, hitherto unreported in vulval BA, as the causative agent in both biopsies. On follow-up, Patient 2 had developed additional lesions in the vulva and thigh, but all her lesions and the vulval mass (Patient 1) responded to erythromycin treatment. Patient 1 succumbed to tuberculosis. Heightened recognition of BA underpins rapid and optimal clinicopathological diagnosis, even in uncommon locations. Identification of the causative Bartonella species is important for appropriate, interventive social management."

To establish an effec-tive serological diagnostic technique, we generated the several Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific immunogenic antigens and evaluated the clinical benefits of detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies raised against these target antigens for the diagnosis of patients with active TB. The genes encoding the MTB-specific antigens 6-kDa early secretory antigenic target of MTB (ESAT-6), 10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP-10), ESX-1 substrate protein C (ESPC), 14KD/38KD and ESAT-6/14KD/38KD, were ampli-fied from the MTB genome by PCR. Prokaryotic vectors were constructed for the expression of the individual MTB antigens. The target recombinant protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21/DE3) and purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). An ELISA based immunoassay was set up using these target antigens for the diagnosis of active TB. The detection samples included 98 patients with active TB and 102 healthy control volun-teers. The cutoff OD value for IgG and IgM antibodies was selected according to a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The sensitivity, specificity and positive likelihood ratio were also determined. We successfully cloned, expressed and purified the ESAT-6, CFP-10, ESPC, 14KD/38KD and ESAT-6/14KD/38KD recombinant antigens of MTB. The mean levels of IgG antibodies were significantly higher in patients with pulmonary TB compared with control groups. The target MTB-specific antigens can distinguish a TB infec-tion from a non-TB infection, showing significant difference in statistics (P<0.001). The sensitivity of the IgG test ranged from 69.4% (ESAT-6) to 77.6% (ESAT-6/14KD/38KD) in the active TB patients; the specificity of assays varied from 78.4% (CFP-10) to 90.2% (14KD+38KD) in the healthy control groups. The IgM antibody test can not distinguish a TB infection from a non-TB healthy control. In conclusion, clinical use of the ESAT-6, CFP-10, ESPC, 14KD/38KD and ESAT-6/14KD/38KD antigens based on serodiagnostic IgG assay is of significant value for the rapid diagnosis of TB and for the discrimination between active TB patients and healthy controls."

Since M. tuberculosis DNA was found in a significant percentage of sarcoidosis patients, we analyzed the relationship between HLA-DRB1 alleles, inflammatory markers and the presence of M. tuberculosis DNA in sarcoidosis and its influence on clinical course. METHODS: From 144 patients with sarcoidosis lung tissue, BAL and/or blood were investigated by means of PCR assays to detect an 123 bp multicopy element of M. tuberculosis DNA and HLA-DRB1 alleles, respectively. ACE was measured spectrophotometrically, sIL-2R by ELISA. Clinical data describing the disease course were available from 63 patients. RESULTS: The percentage of M. tuberculosis positive sarcoidosis patients was significantly increased in the chronic patients group compared to acute disease. The percentage of HLA-DRB 1*03 positive patients was significantly higher in acute sarcoidosis, whereas in chronic disease the HLA-DRB1*11 positive patients were clearly over-represented. In addition, we found a highly significant correlation of HLA-DRB1*11 or -DRB1*15 alleles and/or the presence of M. tuberculosis DNA to a chronic disease course, whereas HLA-DRB1*03 or -DRB1*04 alleles combined with the absence of M. tuberculosis DNA were associated with an acute sarcoidosis (p = 0.009). ACE and sIL2-R serum levels were significantly higher in M. tuberculosis positive sarcoidosis independent of the HLA-DRB1 specificity, but did not differ between acute and chronic disease course alone. CONCLUSIONS: The association between certain HLA-DR antigens, the presence of M. tuberculosis DNA and disease course indicates that specific antigens of M. tuberculosis may play a pathogenetic role in chronic sarcoidosis."

BCG was engineered to express the CTL epitope of HCV-non-structure protein 5a (NS5a) as a chimeric protein with alpha antigen of mycobacteria. Immunization with this recombinant BCG elicited major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted CD8(+) HCV-NS5a-specific CTLs in mice. Immunized mice showed a substantial reduction in the vaccinia virus titer compared with control mice when the immunized mice were challenged with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HCV-NS5a genes. These findings provide evidences for the possibility of BCG as a vaccine vector and its continued exploration as a vehicle for eliciting HCV-specific immunity."

Logistic regression analysis was used to screen independent variables among obesity-related anthropometric indexes and serum biochemical indicators for genes. RESULTS: The waist circumference density index (WCDI) may be attributed to changes in serum biochemical indicators and among WCDI, BMI and serum biochemical indicators, however, only WCDI was an independent variable for the G allele. Differences were observed in anthropometric indexes and serum biochemical indicators between subjects with the G allele and those without (p<0.05).

There is a need to redefine standardization of diagnosis and management protocols for childhood tuberculosis. Process: Indian Academy of Pediatrics constituted a Working Group to develop consensus statement on childhood tuberculosis (TB). Members of the Group were given individual responsibilities to review the existing literature on different aspects of the childhood TB. The group deliberated and developed a consensus which was circulated to all the members for review. Efforts were made to ensure that the recommendations are standardized. Objectives: To produce recommendations and standard protocols for reasonably accurate diagnosis and rational treatment of tuberculosis in children. Recommendations: Fever and / or cough > 2 weeks with loss of weight and recent contact with infectious case should arouse suspicion of TB. Chest X-ray and trial with broad-spectrum antibiotic for 7-10 days is justified. In case of clinical and radiological non-response, Mantoux test and sputum or gastric aspirate for AFB is recommended. If AFB is positive, diagnosis is confirmed. If AFB is negative but chest X-ray is suggestive and Mantoux test is positive, it is a probable case and if these tests are negative, alternate diagnosis must be sought and referral made to an expert. Ideally it is recommended to use 1TU of PPD for Mantoux test but 2 or 5 TU may be acceptable (but less preferred). Cut-off point of 10 mms for natural infection may be used for test done with 1, 2 or 5 TU. There is no linear relation of reaction to tuberculin strength and so no more than 5 TU should be used. BCG test is not recommended. Diagnosis must not be made without an attempt to look for AFB in gastric aspirate or sputum, as it is possible to get AFB even in primary complex. Elisa and PCR tests for TB are not recommended. There is no place for trial of anti-tubercular therapy. Lymphnode enlargement >2 cm with or without typical findings suggestive of TB and failure of antibiotic response demands FNAC for histopathology and bacteriology. Clinical suspicion of tubercular meningitis (TBM) should be confirmed by CSF examination and CT scan though none of these investigations are confirmatory and hence should not be considered in isolation. CSF tests for TB antibody and PCR are not recommended for routine use. Diagnosis of abdominal TB is made on circumstantial evidence and there are no standard guidelines. For treatment, disease is divided into three categories. The Category I and III are recommended for different types of new cases i.e. those who have received treatment for not more than 4 weeks. Category III includes primary pulmonary complex, one site peripheral lympha-denitis and pleural effusion, while all other forms of TB are included in Category I, that corresponds to smear positive TB in adults. This is because AFB is often found in many Category I disease in children. Category II includes defaulters, relapses and failure cases irrespective of the site of disease. Standard protocol is followed for each of these categories. Intermittent thrice weekly therapy with higher dose has been found to be equally effective as daily therapy and so is recommended in DOTS - Direct Observed Therapy Short term. Compliance of treatment must be ensured. Repeat chest X-ray is ideal at the end of therapy. Liver function tests are not routinely recommended. Recommendations are also made for special situations such as MDRTB, TB and HIV and neonate born to mother suffering from TB."

Besides identified risk factors for CAP, there may be a phenotype-genotype association with cytokines, resulting in enhanced inflammatory response resulting in the adverse outcome (AO), namely complications and death. AIM: To assess the association of IL1RA gene polymorphism on serum levels of IL1RA and with AO in children under 5 years of age hospitalized with WHO-defined severe CAP. METHOD: A prospective cohort study with nested case-control design conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital after obtaining institutional ethical approval. Included were children between 2 and 59 months of age hospitalized with WHO-defined severe CAP with consistent radiological abnormalities. Excluded were those with suspected or proven cystic fibrosis, pulmonary tuberculosis, malignancy, immunodeficiency, and congenital heart disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyze the Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) of IL1RA gene polymorphism and ELISA test to detect serum levels of IL1RA. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2016, of 420 screened cases, 350 were eligible and included, of which 132 (37.7%) had no complication and 218 (62.3%) had AO, which included complications like empyema, pyopneumothorax, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and septic shock of these 24 (6.9%) expired. Higher risk of AO was seen in A2A2 genotype (OR 11.18, p 0.0001) and lower in A1A1 genotype (OR 0.18, P<0.0001). Serum IL1RA (ng/mL) was statistically significantly elevated in CAP with AO (2.551.44) versus uncomplicated (0.870.52) (P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: In IL1RA gene, A1A1 genotype was associated with lower risk and A2A2 genotype with increased the risk of AO. Higher serum levels of IL1RA were found in A2A2 genotype indicating possibly enhanced inflammatory response resulting in AO of CAP."

However, after 48 h of infection, bfl-1/A1 expression was evident only in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv but not in M. tuberculosis H37Ra infected cells. When parallel experiments were performed with Human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), differential expression of bfl-1/A1 mRNA was observed in case of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. tuberculosis H37Ra infection. siRNA mediated inhibition of bfl-1/A1 induced apoptosis in M. tuberculosis H37Rv infected THP-1 and MDMs. Reduction in intracellular mycobacterial growth was observed in bfl-1/A1 siRNA transfected, M. tuberculosis H37Rv infected THP-1 cells. Enhancement of phagosome-lysosome fusion was observed in bfl-1/A1 siRNA treated and M. tuberculosis H37Rv infected THP-1 cells.

An average of 65% of the macrophages from 11 of 11 patients with untreated, culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis reacted with an antibody documented herein to be monospecific for human NOS2. In contrast, a mean of 10% of bronchoalveolar lavage cells were positive from each of five clinically normal subjects. Tuberculosis patients' macrophages displayed diaphorase activity in the same proportion that they stained for NOS2, under assay conditions wherein the diaphorase reaction was strictly dependent on NOS2 expression. Bronchoalveolar lavage specimens also contained NOS2 mRNA.

The performance of the genus probe was compared with the performance of probes specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium and with that of standard culture. In addition, the utility of an internal control in monitoring amplification inhibitors was studied. Of 545 respiratory and 325 nonrespiratory specimens (a total of 870 specimens), 58 (6.7%) showed the presence of amplification inhibitors, as determined by a negative result for the internal control. Of these 58 specimens, 31 (53%) were stool specimens; other material, even titrate blood after lysis of erythrocytes, did not pose a problem with regard to inhibition of PCR amplification. Eighty-one of the remaining 812 specimens had a positive Mycobacterium culture result. Of these culture-positive specimens, 58 (71.6%) showed a positive result with the Mycobacterium genus-specific probe. Seventy-two samples had a positive result with the Mycobacterium- specific probe but a negative culture result. Of these 72 samples, 26 samples were regarded as true positive, either because the M. tuberculosis- or M. avium-specific probe was also positive at the same time or because other specimens from the same patient taken at the same time were culture positive. The sensitivity of the Mycobacterium-specific probe was 78.5% and the specificity was 93.5%. This study showed that pretesting of clinical specimens for mycobacteria to the genus level with a Mycobacterium-specific probe offers the routine clinical laboratory the possibility of detecting tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria with one test. Furthermore, specimens testing positive with the genus-specific probe can be immediately identified with species specific probes."

The advent of specific chemotherapy and the recognition of human diseases caused by a number of mycobacterial species other than M. tuberculosis increased the scope and importance of the clinical laboratory in guiding the diagnosis and management of mycobacterial disease. This included the isolation of mycobacteria, the identification of the isolates, the determination of their susceptibilities to chemotherapeutic agents and their subtyping for epidemiologic purposes. In spite of the enhanced role it has played in the past forty years, the laboratory's contribution has been impeded by the slow growth of mycobacteria, which causes delays of weeks or months between submission of a specimen and the availability of a definitive report. In the meantime both the urgency and the complexity of diagnosis and management of mycobacterial disease have increased with the emergence of epidemics of these diseases associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This development has also increased the need for recognition of tubercle bacilli in such specimens as blood and stools, which were only infrequently studied in past years. Recent developments in microchemical and immunologic technology, and especially molecular biology, are greatly reducing the time needed to get information that contributes to diagnosis and management of mycobacterial disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We conducted a prospective multi-center cross-sectional study to compare induced sputum to throat swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Confirmed COVID-19 patients from six hospitals in six cities across China who received one or more negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled, and paired specimens (induced sputum and throat swabs; 56 cases) were assayed. In three paired samples, both the induced sputum and throat swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positive rate for induced sputum was significantly higher than for throat swabs both overall (28.6% vs 5.4%, respectively; p <0.01). Patients were divided according to time span from onset of illness to sample collection into the more-than-30-day (n=26) and less-than-30-day (n=30) groups. The positive rate for induced sputum was also significantly higher than for throat swabs in the less-than-30-day group (53.3% vs 10.0%, respectively; p <0.001). For the more-than-30-day group, all paired samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and heart rate remained stable during sputum induction and no staff were infected. Because induced sputum is more reliable and has a lower false-negative rate than throat swabs, we believe induced sputum is more useful for the confirmation of COVID-19 and is safer as a criterion for release from quarantine."

With Indian strains and isolates of L. donovani the assay was sensitive enough to detect kDNA in an amount equivalent to a single parasite or less. The extreme sensitivity of the assay was reflected in its ability to detect parasite DNA from small volumes of peripheral blood of patients with kala-azar (KA) and from skin lesions from patients with post-KA dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). A total of 107 clinical leishmaniasis samples were analyzed. Of these 102 (95.3%) were positive by PCR. The test provided a diagnosis of KA with 96% sensitivity using patient whole-blood samples instead of bone marrow or spleen aspirates that are obtained by invasive procedures. The assay was also successful in the diagnosis of 45 of 48 PKDL cases (93.8%). Cross-reactions with pathogens prevalent in the area of endemicity, viz., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and Plasmodium spp., could be ruled out. Eighty-one control samples, including dermal scrapings from healthy portions of skin from patients with PKDL were all negative. Two of twenty controls from the area of endemicity were found positive by PCR assay; however, there was a good possibility that these two were asymptomatic carriers since they were serologically positive for KA. Thus, this PCR assay represents a tool for the diagnosis of KA and PKDL in Indian patients in a noninvasive manner, with simultaneous species identification of parasites in clinical samples."

DESIGN: Sequential testing of four treatment groups of calves over a 2 year period. PROCEDURE: Twenty-nine calves were allocated to four groups. Group D calves were orally dosed with M paratuberculosis, group N calves naturally exposed to M paratuberculosis, group V calves vaccinated for M paratuberculosis, and group C were control calves (not infected or vaccinated). Blood and faecal specimens were collected from each calf at monthly intervals to 18 months of age and then every 2 months until they were slaughtered between the ages of 21 and 29 months. Specimens were tested using absorbed EIA, IFN-gamma EIA and faecal culture. The infection status of the calves was confirmed by extensive histopathological examination and tissue culture. RESULTS: M paratuberculosis infection was confirmed in 10 calves, comprising six of eight orally dosed calves, three of five naturally exposed calves and one of nine vaccinated calves. The six artificially infected calves and one naturally infected calf were detected shedding M paratuberculosis in their faeces. Results with positive absorbed EIA were obtained from one artificially infected calf, one naturally infected calf and three vaccinated calves. All calves including controls had positive results on at least one occasion using the IFN-gamma EIA. In addition, seven calves had positive bovine tuberculosis results using the IFN-gamma EIA, even though bovine tuberculosis has been eradicated from Australia. CONCLUSION: Detection of M paratuberculosis infection in young cattle continues to be difficult using current tests."

This is mainly due to the fact of our perceived notion that clinical signs of TB are often subtle in severely malnourished children and we may rely on laboratory investigation for the diagnosis. However, comparative data on the performance of clinical and laboratory diagnostics of TB in such population are also very limited. Objectives: To compare the performance of composite clinical criteria and a technique that measures antibodies in lymphocyte supernatant (ALS) for the diagnosis of TB in severely malnourished children with pneumonia. Methods: Severely malnourished children under five with radiological pneumonia admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh were enrolled consecutively following informed consent. We collected venous blood for ALS, gastric lavage fluid and induced sputum for microscopy, mycobacterial culture, and real-time PCR by Xpert MTB/RIF. We compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values, and accuracy of modified Kenneth Jones criteria (MKJC) score, World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, and ALS in diagnosing TB in severely malnourished children with pneumonia for ""Confirmed TB"" and ""All TB"" (""Confirmed TB"" plus ""Probable TB"") vs. ""Not TB."" Results: Compared to culture confirmed TB, the sensitivity, and specificity (95% CI) for MKJC were 60 (27-86) and 84 (79-87)% and for WHO criteria were 40 (14-73) and 84 (80-87)%, respectively. Compared to culture and/or Xpert MTB/RIF positive TB, the sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) for the criteria were 37 (20-58) and 84 (79-87)%; and 22 (9-43) and 83 (79-87)%, respectively. For both these comparisons, the sensitivity and specificity of ALS were 50 (14-86) and 60 (53-67)%, respectively. Conclusion: Our data suggest that WHO criteria and MKJC scoring mainly based on clinical criteria are more useful than ALS in diagnosing TB in young severely malnourished children with pneumonia. The results underscore the importance of using clinical criteria for the diagnosis of TB in severely malnourished children that may help to minimize the chance of over treatment with anti-TB in such population, especially in resource limited TB endemic settings."

We next investigated the mechanistic role of the vaccine during helminth-TB co-infection. Clinically, helminth infection causes type 2 granulomas in the lung. Mice were immunized with DNA-hsp65 while they were submitted to the type 2 granuloma induction protocol by Schistosoma mansoni eggs infusion. In this work we investigated the effects of DNA-hsp65 on the pathology and immune response during the development of type 2 granuloma induced by S. mansoni eggs. Histologic analyses of lung parenchyma showed that the DNA-hsp65 vaccine protected mice against exacerbated fibrosis induced by Schistosoma eggs, and decreased the size of the granulomas. These changes were correlated with a reduction in the number of T cells specific for the egg antigens in the lung and also with modulation of Th2 cytokine expression.

Viral RNA was found in PBMCs from 31 (74%) patients, and of those 29 (69%) were also positive for HCV-RNA (-). Neither normalization of alanine aminotransferase nor IFNL genotype predicted the presence of residual HCV-RNA. A significantly higher neutrocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) 24weeks after the start of treatment predicted elimination of replicative HCV-RNA strand (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.10-0.86; P=0.019). Patients with no HCV-RNA (-) in PBMCs showed a greater increase in neutrocyte count between EOT and baseline (P=0.028).

Lipopeptides are present in a wide variety of microbes and stimulate immune responses through TLR1/2 or TLR2/6 heterodimers. It is not currently known whether polymorphisms in TLR1 regulate the innate immune response. We stimulated human whole blood with triacylated lipopeptide, a ligand for TLR1/2 heterodimers, and found substantial inter-individual variation in the immune response. We sequenced the coding region of TLR1 and found a non-synonymous polymorphism, I602S (base pair T1805G), that regulated signalling. In comparison to TLR1_602S, the 602I variant mediated substantially greater basal and lipopeptide-induced NF-kappaB signalling in transfected HEK293 cells. These signalling differences among TLR1 variants were also found with stimulation by extracts of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore, individuals with the 602II genotype produced substantially more IL-6 than those with the 602SS variant in a lipopeptide-stimulated whole-blood cytokine assay. Together, these observations demonstrate that variation in the inflammatory response to bacterial lipopeptides is regulated by a common TLR1 transmembrane domain polymorphism that could potentially impact the innate immune response and clinical susceptibility to a wide spectrum of pathogens."

An effort was made to sample villages or schools from a wide an area as possible on all islands. Diagnosis was initially based on Giemsa stained blood slides followed by molecular analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: In Tafea Province, 73% (5238/7150) of children (2-12 y) were surveyed and in Temotu Province, in the all-ages survey, 50.2% (8742/17410) of the provincial population participated in the survey. In both Vanuatu and Solomon Islands malariometric surveys of their southern-most islands in 2008 showed relatively low over-all malaria parasite prevalence (2 to 3%). Other features of malaria in these island groups were low parasitaemia, low gametocyte carriage rates, low spleen rates, low malaria associated morbidity, a high incidence of asymptomatic infections, and a predominance of Plasmodium vivax over Plasmodium falciparum. CONCLUSION: For various reasons malaria rates are declining in these provinces providing a favourable situation for local malaria elimination. This will be advanced using mass distribution of bed nets and selective indoor residual spraying, the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin combination therapy, and intensive case detection and surveillance. It is as yet uncertain whether malaria parasites can themselves be sustainably eliminated from entire Melanesian islands, where they have previously been endemic. Key issues on the road to malaria elimination will be continued community involvement, improved field diagnostic methods and elimination of residual P. vivax parasites from the liver of asymptomatic persons."

T1 weighted MRI showed a diffuse decreased signal intensity limited to the white matter without mass effect. A brain biopsy specimen had a morphology similar to that of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. Polyomavirus antigen was detected in the brain lesion, and viral DNA was identified in nucleated blood cells and urine.

Three apparently common mutations in the NOD2 gene are found in up to 30% of sporadic patients with Crohn's disease in western countries. We examined whether such mutations are also found in Indian patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS: Venous blood was collected from 82 patients (age range: 7-65 years, 53 men) with Crohn's disease and 149 control subjects; DNA was extracted and subjected to polymerase chain reaction using specific primers. The amplified fragments of size 185, 163 and 151 bp for R702W, G908R and 1007fs, respectively, were digested with MspI, HhaI and ApaI, and the restriction pattern noted after electrophoresis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients had ileocolonic disease, 26 ileal disease, 20 colonic disease and 8 had disease limited to proximal small bowel or stomach. None of the 82 patients showed any of the three NOD2 mutations. The control subjects (93 men) had a variety of chronic gastrointestinal disorders (ulcerative colitis 52, irritable bowel syndrome 30, intestinal tuberculosis 20, colon cancer 7, miscellaneous 37). None of the control subjects showed a mutation in any of the three NOD2 mutation analyses. CONCLUSION: The three NOD2 gene mutations described above are uncommon in Indian patients with Crohn's disease. This study complements information provided by recent studies on NOD2 mutations in Indians."

In five patients the serum level of the core protein p24 decreased, while in five cases it remained unchanged. The level of viral RNA in plasma as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) decreased in four cases, was stable in another four, and increased in three cases. An anti-mouse (HAMA) response developed in eight patients and anti-idiotypic antibodies appeared in six. Immune complexes that formed in patient sera during the treatment were shown to contain mostly envelope glycoprotein gp120 which decreased in nine of the eleven treated patients toward the end of treatment. Antibodies inhibiting gp120 binding to CD4 became detectable or increased in six patients during immunotherapy. Serology of the HIV-1 V3 region was studied for both the HIV-1 IIIB and MN strains with no or very small changes in titer or avidity after treatment. No change in neutralizing titers to strain HTLVIIIB was observed in serum samples collected before and after treatment was terminated. In nine of the eleven patients stimulation of the T lymphocytes to proliferate in vitro when activated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was shown to be increased compared to before treatment. Increased T-cell proliferation was also noted with several antigens such as HIV-1 recombinant antigens, cytomegalovirus (CMV), tetanus toxoid (TT), and purified protein derivate of mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD). These findings indicate a decreased total gp120 content in serum, permitting better T-cell activation."

As no functional information was available, 10 of these genes were selected and shown to be expressed in vitro by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Antibodies against five PE-PGRS proteins, raised in mice by DNA vaccination, detected single proteins when the same plasmid constructs used for immunization were expressed in epithelial cells or in reticulocyte extracts, confirming that the PE-PGRS proteins are antigenic. As expected from the conserved repetitive structure, the antibodies cross-reacted with more than one PE-PGRS protein, suggesting that different proteins share common epitopes. PE-PGRS proteins were detected by West-ern blotting in five different mycobacterial species (M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. smegmatis, M. marinum and M. gordonae) and 11 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. Whole-genome comparisons of M. tuberculosis predicted allelic diversity in the PE-PGRS family, and this was confirmed by immunoblot studies as size variants were detected in clinical strains. Subcellular fractionation studies and immunoelectron microscopy localized many PE-PGRS proteins in the cell wall and cell membrane of M. tuberculosis. The data suggest that some PE-PGRS proteins are variable surface antigens."

METHODS: Experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) was induced in B10.RIII mice with coadministration of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein peptide (IRBP) and killed mycobacterial antigen (MTB) as an adjuvant. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we looked at intestinal microbial differences during the course of uveitis, as well as intestinal morphologic changes, changes in intestinal permeability by FITC-dextran leakage, antimicrobial peptide expression in the gastrointstinal tract, and T lymphocyte prevalence before and at peak intraocular inflammation. RESULTS: We demonstrate that increased intestinal permeability and antimicrobial peptide expression in the intestinal tract coincide in timing with increased effector T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes, during the early stages of uveitis, before peak inflammation. Morphologic changes in the intestine were most prominent during this phase, but also occurred with adjuvant MTB alone, whereas increased intestinal permeability was found only in IRBP-immunized mice that develop uveitis. We also demonstrate that the intestinal microbiota were altered during the course of uveitis, and that some of these changes are specific to uveitic animals, whereas others are influenced by adjuvant MTB alone. Intestinal permeability peaked at 2 weeks, coincident with an increase in intestinal bacterial strain differences, peak lipocalin production, and peak uveitis. CONCLUSIONS: An intestinal dysbiosis accompanies a disruption in intestinal homeostasis in autoimmune uveitis, although adjuvant MTB alone promotes intestinal disruption as well. This may indicate a novel axis for future therapeutic targeting experimentally or clinically."

NF-IL-6 and NF-kappaB are expressed in macrophages and is induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharides. To evaluate whether NF-IL-6 is required for the inflammatory immune response to mycobacterial infection, in which epithelioid macrophages comprise the leading cell population, we generated NF-IL-6 knockout (KO) mutant mice. Airborne infection of these mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains induced disseminated tuberculosis lacking granuloma formation, although interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-12 mRNA expression levels were within the normal range compared with those of wild-type mice. Generation of O2- and mycobacterial killing by neutrophils from these mice were impaired severely compared with wild-type mice. We conclude that NF-IL-6 is a critical transcription factor in mycobacterial control as well as in granulocyte-colony stimulating factor induction resulting in neutrophil activation."

However, it is difficult to collect tumor tissue of advanced lung adenocarcinoma, and some experts agree that peripheral blood can be used as a substitute for tumor tissue as a test specimen. This paper aimed to investigate the clinical value of ddPCR and super-amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) in detecting EGFR gene mutation in peripheral blood of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A total of 119 patients diagnosed in Beijing Chest Hospital Affiliated to Capital Medical University from February 2016 to February 2019 were collected, and the sensitivity and specificity of plasma ctDNA EGFR gene mutation detected by ddPCR and super-arms were compared. Some patients with positive EGFR gene mutations received oral treatment with first-line EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI). The patients were divided into subgroups according to the test results. In group 1, both ddPCR and super-arms showed positive EGFR gene mutation results, with 21 cases. In group 2, ddPCR and super-arms detection of EGFR gene mutation were all negative, with 16 cases. In group 3, the ddPCR test was positive and the super-arms test was negative, with 5 cases. In group 4, the ddPCR test result was negative while the super-arms test result was positive. Since the number of patients in group 4 was 0, no statistics were included. Objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were used to evaluate the short-term outcome, and progression-free survival (PFS) was compared with survival analysis to evaluate the long-term outcome. RESULTS: EGFR mutations were detected in 58 (48.7%) of 119 patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. The coincidence rate between ddPCR and EGFR gene mutation in tumor tissues was 82.4% (Kappa=0.647, P<0.001), the sensitivity was 74.1%, and the specificity was 90.2%. However, the coincidence degree of super-arms test and tissue test was 71.4%, the sensitivity was only 58.6%, and the specificity was 83.6%. The ORR and DCR values in group 3 were lower than those in group 1 and 2, but there was no significant difference in ORR between groups (P>0.05). Survival analysis showed that the PFS of the three groups was compared. The difference was not statistically significant (=2.221, P=0.329). CONCLUSIONS: ddPCR, as a high sensitivity and specificity liquid gene detection method, can be used as a reliable method to detect the mutation of plasma ctDNA EGFR gene in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. The results of plasma genetic testing can also be used as the basis for predicting the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in patients."

A throbbing headache occurring or worsening in the upright position and improving after lying down, a so-called 'orthostatic headache', low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, and diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the major features of the classic syndrome. These patients, who are admitted with fever, headache, and CSF findings revealing lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein concentration, normal glucose levels, and negative culture results, are prone to be misdiagnosed with aseptic meningitis. The aims of this single-centre retrospective study were to determine the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of patients initially evaluated as having aseptic meningitis but subsequently diagnosed with SIH, and to touch upon the key points of the differential diagnosis in daily infectious diseases practice. Methods: Patients referred to Cerrahpasa Medical School with a presumed diagnosis of aseptic meningitis or viral meningitis between 1 January 2006 and 1 January 2011 were reviewed. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and follow-up data obtained from the hospital database were processed. Patients confirmed to have SIH syndrome were included for evaluation. Results: Eleven cases of SIH syndrome were diagnosed during the study period (8 male and 3 female, median age 30 y, range 2144 y). All had headache, hearing changes, and nausea. Vomiting (10/11) and posterior neck pain (9/11) were also frequent. Seven had fever and 5 had a stiff neck. Four cases had lymphocytic pleocytosis, 4 cases had elevated CSF protein concentrations (> 1.5 times the upper limit of normal), and 2 cases had slightly lower CSF glucose levels. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of the CSF for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, and enteroviruses were negative in all cases. MRI of the 11 cases revealed signs of spontaneous CSF leaks with diffuse pachymeningeal gadolinium enhancement (11/11), sagging of the brain (9/11), enlargement of the pituitary (6/11), engorgement of the venous structures (5/11), and subdural fluid collections (2/11). CSF leaks were demonstrated by intrathecal magnetic resonance or computed tomography myelography at different levels along the thoracic spine (7/11), cervico-thoracic junction (2/11), and thoraco-lumbar junction (2/11). Autologous blood injection into the spinal epidural space ('blood patch') was performed for treatment. Strict bed rest followed, and all patients recovered fully within a week; no recurrence or complication was observed during the follow-up periods, which ranged from 6 months to 5 y.Conclusions: Findings of fever, headache, and meningeal irritation are generally accepted as the clinical features of meningitis. When CSF findings are not characteristically compatible with bacterial meningitis and particularly when the headache is orthostatic in nature, SIH should also be included in the differential diagnosis. MRI findings are characteristic and clearly contribute to the differential diagnosis between viral meningitis and SIH.  2012 Informa Healthcare."

Methods: Systematic review of the literature concerning OTB, limiting the results to English-language peer-reviewed journals. Results: Seventy-nine patients from 39 publications were identified as cases of OTB. The condition presents in one of five forms: classical periostitis; orbital soft tissue tuberculoma or cold abscess, with no bony involvement; OTB with bony involvement; spread from the paranasal sinuses; and tuberculous dacryoadenitis. The ocular adnexa, including the nasolacrimal system and overlying skin, may also be involved. Conclusions: Diagnosis can be difficult and may necessitate an orbital biopsy, in which acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and characteristic histopathology may be seen. Growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mTB) from such a specimen remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Ancillary investigations include tuberculin skin tests and chest radiography, but more recently alternatives such as whole blood interferon- immunological tests and PCR-based tests of pathological specimens have proven useful. The management of OTB is complex, requiring a stringent public health strategy and high levels of patient adherence, combined with long courses of multiple anti-tuberculous medications. The interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with TB may further complicate management. Copyright  2008 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc."

By using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) we could demonstrate that restimulation with crude Echinococcus granulosus antigen (Eg-Ag) induced or enhanced Th2 cytokine mRNA expression, especially IL-5 (by using antigen from sheep cyst fluid) in 23 out of 26 investigated CE patients and IL-10 (by using antigen from camel cyst fluid) in 10 out of 10 investigated CE patients. In contrast, IL-5 mRNA expression was absent in PBMC of healthy controls after Eg-Ag stimulation. To determine the specificity of this reaction we stimulated PBMC from 11 CE patients with crude Echinococcus multilocularis antigen (Em-Ag) and PBMC from 8 CE patients with Toxocara canis antigen (Tc-Ag). We found that the PBMC of patients showed a similar mRNA cytokine pattern on stimulation with Em-Ag when compared with Eg-Ag stimulation. The cytokine mRNA pattern on stimulation with Tc-Ag, however, resembled the cytokine mRNA pattern of unstimulated PBMC. Furthermore, the stimulation of PBMC with crude Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen (H37Ra) and purified protein derivative (PPD) of M. tuberculosis revealed distinct IL-5 mRNA expression in all investigated CE patients, whereas in healthy controls IL-5 mRNA expression was very weak or totally absent. Thus, our results indicate an induction of Th2 cytokine mRNA expression in CE patients, which is frequently observed in parasite infections. Interestingly, this response persists after stimulation with tuberculosis antigens, which normally induce Th1 response."

Genetic variants in microRNA genes might affect microRNA-mediated cell regulation. This preliminary study was designed to investigate the association of the microRNA-196a2 rs11614913 (C/T) polymorphism with susceptibility to asthma and clinical outcomes in children and adolescents. Genotyping of rs11614913 polymorphism was determined in 96 patients with bronchial asthma (6-18 years of age) and 96 unrelated controls, using real-time polymerase chain reaction technology. In-silico target prediction and network core analyses were performed. The asthmatics did not show significant differences in genotype distribution (p = 0.609) and allele frequencies (p = 0.428) compared with the controls. There were also no associations with disease duration, age at onset, asthma phenotype, asthma control, therapeutic level, airway hyper-responsiveness, or biochemical parameters in the blood. However, the CC genotype was associated with a more severe degree of asthma (p = 0. 023) and higher frequency of nocturnal asthma (p = 0.002). Carriers for CC were 17 times more likely to develop nocturnal asthma, and had a more than 2.5-fold increased risk for poor disease outcome compared with CT and TT individuals. In conclusion, microRNA-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism might be associated with asthma severity in our sample of the Egyptian population. Further investigations in studies with a larger sample size and functional tests are needed to validate our findings and to explore the detailed biological mechanisms."

However, the pathophysiological mechanism leading to LGC formation, especially the contribution of the T cells abundantly found in granulomas, has not been fully elucidated. To examine the role of T cells in LGC formation, a new in vitro method for the induction of LGCs was developed by co-culturing human monocytes with autologous T cells in the presence of concanavalin A (ConA). This system required close contact between monocytes and T cells, and CD4+ T cells were more potent than CD8+ T cells in inducing LGC formation. Antibody inhibition revealed that a CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L) interaction and IFN- were essential for LGC formation, and the combination of exogenous soluble CD40L (sCD40L) and IFN- efficiently replaced the role of T cells. Dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), a known fusion-related molecule in monocytes, was up-regulated during LGC formation. Moreover, knock-down of DC-STAMP by siRNA inhibited LGC formation, revealing that DC-STAMP was directly involved in LGC formation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that T cells played a pivotal role in a new in vitro LGC formation system, in which DC-STAMP was involved, and occurred via a molecular mechanism that involved CD40-CD40L interaction and IFN- secretion."

However, some biologics are accompanied with severe side effects, including tuberculosis and other types of infection. There is thus a critical need for nonsystemic and lesion-specific methods of delivering these therapeutic agents. We attempted to treat a mouse model of arthritis by using T cells that expressed a regulatory molecule and were specifically directed to the inflamed paw. To this end, we first identified the TCR alphabeta genes accumulating in the inflamed paw of mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) by a combination of single-strand chain polymorphism analysis of TCR and single-cell sorting. We identified an expanded clone B47 which is autoreactive but is not specific to type II collagen. In vivo, TCR genes from B47-transduced T cells accumulated in the inflamed paw. Injection of cells cotransduced with the B47 and soluble TNFRIg genes resulted in a significant suppression of CIA. The suppression was correlated with the amount of TNFRIg transcripts in the hind paw, not with the serum concentrations of TNFRIg. Moreover, T cells cotransduced with the B47 and intracellular Foxp3 genes significantly suppressed CIA with reductions in TNF-alpha, IL-17A, and IL-1beta expression and bone destruction. T cells cotransduced with B47 and Foxp3 genes also suppressed the progression of established CIA. Therefore, immunosuppressive therapy with autoreactive TCR is a promising therapeutic strategy for arthritis whether the TCRs are used to deliver either soluble or intracellular suppressive molecules."

Acute infection requires rapid turn-around testing with high predictive values, that is, the ability of a test to accurately identify those patients who do or do not have disease caused by a specific etiology. The Gram's stain, fungal stains of direct smears, antigen testing for C. neoformans, and culture of bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, and some viruses are important tests for the diagnosis of acute infection. The laboratory diagnosis of chronic infection necessitates discussion between the clinician and laboratory technician to allow triaging of testing. Antigen tests for bacteria, fungi, and viruses; antibody tests for multiple microorganisms; and PCR testing for bacteria, M. tuberculosis, and many viruses are all important in limited clinical situations. All testing for acute or chronic disease depends on sufficient specimen that is transported to the laboratory in a manner that will not compromise viability or chemical integrity. Sterile containers that maintain moisture content, exclude oxygen for anaerobic requests, and are stored at proper temperatures (22 degrees C room, 4 degrees C refrigeration, or -20 degrees C freezer depending on pathogen and test) are mandatory. Many laboratory issues addressing the diagnosis of CNS infection are changing or evolving. Most important is the recognition that bacterial antigen testing for the diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis rarely impacts patient management and is not routinely needed, CSF shunt infections differ from usual meningeal infections and require rapid diagnosis, and TB meningitis remains a difficult disease to diagnosis but may be confirmed first by PCR testing of CSF. In addition, Whipple's disease of the CNS can be confirmed using PCR with CSF; CJD has a marker protein, referred to as 14-3-3 antigen, that can be detected in CSF, and the diagnosis of fungal CNS disease requires careful interpretation of direct smears, antigen and antibody testing, and culture. Most difficult to diagnose among the CNS infections are viral meningitis and encephalitis. The appearance of new etiologies, such as West Nile virus, and the common use of PCR for the herpes viruses and enteroviruses represent important advances. Evolving methods for the laboratory diagnosis of CNS infection represent significant improvements over previous testing; however, the array of tests available demands more attention for appropriate selection, is significantly more expensive, and requires new skills for performance and interpretation. The responsibility for proper use of laboratory testing lies both with the clinician and laboratory technician."

PCR cloning and sequence analysis of the TCR chains demonstrated extensive junctional diversity indicating that the response was polyclonal. The marked in vitro gamma delta T cell response to Mycobacteria was also detected in newborns before encounters with foreign Ag and exclusively involved the same V-gene usage observed in adults.

Twenty-four of these clones were purified, analyzed, and found to comprise two groups according to the reactivity of the recombinant proteins with LL sera and to the DNA restriction patterns of the recombinant plasmids and cosmids. Proteins specified by clones from group I reacted strongly with LL patients' sera on a Western blot (immunoblot), demonstrating a 15-kDa protein band designated A15. The A15 antigen also reacted with pooled sera from patients with tuberculoid leprosy from the United States and Brazil. Clones from group II did not show any reactive protein band on a Western blot, when reacted with patients' sera. DNAs from cosmids of group II all contain a 10-kb PstI fragment that hybridized to the unique repetitive M. leprae DNA. Sequence analysis of a 1.2-kb fragment containing the entire coding sequence of A15 revealed three open reading frames (ORFs), only one of which (ORF II) contains sufficient genetic information to encode for A15. Part of the A15 gene was found to exist also in a group of lambda gt11:M. leprae clones previously isolated in our laboratory by immunological screening with LL patients' sera. One of the lambda gt11 clones (L8) expresses a beta-galactosidase fusion protein with 89 amino acids from the C terminus of A15. An important result was that the fusion protein was clearly recognized by T cells from leprosy patients. Interestingly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-stimulated T cells from M. leprae nonresponder (LL as well as borderline tuberculoid) patients were able to respond to the isolated recombinant M. leprae antigen, indicating that nonresponsiveness to M. leprae antigens can be reversible. The sequence of the M. leprae DNA fused to the beta-galactosidase gene of lambda gt11 clone L8 was identical to that of a lambda gt11:M. leprae clone isolated recently that expresses an immunologically reactive fusion protein (S.

Besides the complete sequence of the A15 gene, sequencing data of two flanking ORFs are presented.

The importance of IFN- in upregulating the PD-L1 expression in various tumors, and the effects of other essential cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME), need to be further elucidated. METHODS: Constitutive expression of PD-L1 and CD137L in all 13 lung cancer cell lines were tested by flow cytometry. CD137L mRNA of lung cancer cell lines was detected by RT-PCR. PD-L1 expression rates following stimulation with these cytokines (IFN-, TNF and IL2) were measured. After coculture of cells expressing CD137L (lung cancer cells or 293FT cells transfected with CD137L plasmid) with T cells, the PDL1 expression of lung cancer cells and IFN- in supernatant was detected. RESULTS: Our data revealed that adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma cells had the highest positive expression rate. IFN- was the core-inducing factor for enhancing the PD-L1 expression. CD137L was also widely expressed in the lung cancer cell lines at the mRNA level, whereas its expression was generally low at the protein level. However, the low expression of CD137L protein was still enough to induce T cells to produce IFN-, which subsequently increased the PD-L1 expression by lung cancer cells. The CD137 signal induces IFN- secretion by T cells, which stimulates high-level of PD-L1 expression in cancer cells; this negative immune regulation may represent a mechanism of immune escape regulation. CONCLUSIONS: CD137L mRNA was widely expressed in lung cancer cell lines whereas levels of protein expression were generally low. The low level of CD137L protein was still enough to induce T cells to produce IFN- that subsequently increased PD-L1 expression. The CD137L-induced negative immune regulation may represent a mechanism of immune escape."

BCG activates monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response. Therefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic. The hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity. The primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the city of Goinia (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease. Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to BCG. TRIAL DESIGN: This a phase II trial for repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19. The trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with BCG and HW not vaccinated. PARTICIPANTS: The trial will recruit 800 HW of Goinia - Gois, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation. Eligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM and IgG COVID-19 test. Participants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded: - Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including COVID-19; - Have had fever in the last fifteen days; - Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion; - Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases; - Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy; - Have less than 500 neutrophils per mL of blood; - Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis; - Are breastfeeding or pregnant; - Are younger than 18 years old; - Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: HW will be randomized into the BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group. The BCG vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding to approximately 2 x10(5) to 8 x10(5) CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT. LTD.). The unvaccinated control group will not be vaccinated. The HW allocated in both groups will be followed up at specific times points until 180 days post inclusion. The vaccinated and control groups will be compared according to COVID-19 related outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes are the incidence coefficient of infection by SARS-CoV-2 determined by RT-PCR of naso-oropharyngeal swab specimen or rapid lateral flow IgG and IgM test, and presence of general COVID-19 symptoms, disease severity and admission to hospital during the 180 days of follow up. The secondary outcome is the innate immune response elicited 15-20 days after vaccination. RANDOMISATION: The vaccine vial contains approximately 10 doses. In order to optimize the vaccine use, the randomisation was performed in blocks of 20 participants using the platform randomization.com [ http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/permute.htm ]. The randomization was prepared before any HW inclusion. The results were printed and inserted in sealed envelopes that were numbered with BCG-001 to BCG-400. The printed results as well the envelopes had the same numbers. At the time of the randomisation, each participant that meets the inclusion criteria will receive a consecutive participant number [BCG-001-BCG-400]. The sealed envelope with the assigned number, blinded to the researchers, will be opened in front of the participant and the arm allocation will be known. BLINDING (MASKING): There is no masking for the participants or for the healthcare providers. The study will be blinded to the laboratory researchers and to those who will be evaluating the outcomes and performing the statistical analyses. In this case, only the participant identification number will be available. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Four hundred heath workers will be randomised in two groups. Two hundred participants will be vaccinated, and 200 participants will not be vaccinated. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol approved by the Brazilian Ethical Committee is the seventh version, number CAAE: 31783720.0.0000.5078. The trial has been recruiting since September 20(th), 2020. The clinical trial protocol was registered on August 5(th), 2020. It is estimated that recruitment will finish by March 2021.

Leukocytes from two independent JR-CSF transgenic mouse lines produced HIV-1 that infected human PBMCs. Plasma viremia was detected in these mice at levels (mean, >60,000 HIV RNA copies/ml) comparable to those reported for HIV-1-infected individuals. The levels of HIV RNA in these mice increased several-fold after either treatment with the superantigen Staphylococcus enterotoxin B or infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus, a provirus encoding a monocyte-tropic HIV-1 strain under the control of its LTR expressed as a transgene in mice can proceed through the postintegration replication phase and produce infectious virus. In addition, the presence of plasma viremia that can be monitored by measuring plasma HIV-1 RNA levels permits these mice to be used to study the impact of different interventions on modulating in vivo HIV-1 production. Therefore, these mice provide a novel manipulable system to investigate the in vivo regulation of HIV-1 production by factors that activate the immune system. Furthermore, this murine system should be useful in delineating the role of human-specific factors in modulating HIV-1 replication and investigating the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of agents that target the postintegration stages of HIV-1 replication."

However, cancer cells can take advantage of thioredoxin and DJ-1 against ROS-induced cell damage. In several human cancer types, thioredoxin and DJ-1 were found to be overexpressed. The present study aimed to explore the serum levels of thioredoxin and DJ-1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and its relationship to the diagnosis and prognosis of this particular malignancy. Sera from 134 NSCLC patients and 168 healthy controls were obtained. Using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, the levels of serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 were measured and correlated to the clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC patients. The diagnostic and prognostic significance of the biomarkers were evaluated by using receiver operating curve (ROC), Kaplan-Meier curve, and log-rank analyses and the Cox proportional hazard model, respectively. Serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 levels were significantly higher in the NSCLC patients than that in the controls (23.56.57 vs. 13.82.49 and 7.112.02 vs. 5.181.26, respectively). NSCLC patients at later stage cancer showed significantly higher levels of serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 than those at the early stages (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high serum thioredoxin level was an independent risk factor for lymph nodal metastases and distant metastases (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.26-3.41 and OR=3.68, 95% CI 2.16-5.33, respectively).

For predicting the development of NSCLC, ROC/area under the curve (AUC) analysis for thioredoxin indicated an AUC of 0.80 (sensitivity 0.62, specificity 0.92), and ROC/AUC analysis for DJ-1 showed an AUC of 0.78 (sensitivity 0.66, specificity 0.89). NSCLC patients with high serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 levels had lower survival rates than those with low levels, and multivariate analyses for overall survival revealed that high serum thioredoxin levels served as an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC (HR=2.07, 95% CI 1.19-3.48). Serum levels of thioredoxin and DJ-1 were significantly higher in NSCLC patients; therefore, these may be utilized as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC."

We evaluate the performance of HCV RNA quantification using the Xpert() HCV viral load Fingerstick assay (Xpert() HCV VL Fingerstick assay) as compared to the World Health Organisation pre-qualified plasma Xpert() HCV VL assay among people who inject drugs (PWID) attending an opioid agonist therapy (OAT) clinic in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. METHODS: Between December 2018 and February 2019, consecutive HCV seropositive PWID attending the OAT clinic provided paired venous and Fingerstick samples for HCV RNA quantification. These were processed onsite using the GeneXpert() platform located at the Central tuberculosis reference laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 208 out of 220 anti-HCV-positive participants recruited (94.5%) had a valid Xpert() HCV VL result available; 126 (61%; 95% CI 53.8-67.0) had detectable and quantifiable HCV RNA. About 188 (85%) participants had paired plasma and Fingerstick whole blood samples; the sensitivity and specificity for the quantification of HCV RNA levels were 99.1% and 98.7% respectively. There was an excellent correlation (R(2) =.95) and concordance (mean difference 0.13IU/mL, (95% CI -0.9 to 0.16IU/mL) in HCV RNA levels between plasma samples and Fingerstick samples. CONCLUSION: This study found excellent performance of the Xpert() HCV VL Fingerstick assay for HCV RNA detection and quantification in an African-field setting. Its clinical utility represents an important watershed in overcoming existing challenges to HCV diagnosis, which should play a crucial role in HCV elimination in Africa."

West Nile Virus (WNV), a member of Flaviviridae, is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus that is usually transmitted to humans by the bite of Culicine mosquitoes. Although the majority of the human infections are asymptomatic, WNV may also cause febrile and neuro-invasive diseases. Seroprevalence data from Turkey indicate that WNV activity is present in Central Anatolia. In this study performed at Hacettepe University Hospital, paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 87 adult patients with the preliminary diagnosis of aseptic meningitis/encephalitis of unknown etiology were evaluated retrospectively to identify WNV-related syndromes. Bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures yielded negative results and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Herpes simplex virus nucleic acid tests were also negative for the selected patients. Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)s and indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT)s were employed for WNV IgM and IgG antibody detection (Anti-WNV Virus IgG/IgM ELISA, Anti-WNV Virus IgG/IgM IIFT; Euroimmun, Germany). Additional ELISA/IIFT assays were further performed for WNV antibody reactive samples to identify cross-reactions and/or infections with other flaviviruses and phleboviruses. All WNV antibody positive samples were also evaluated by a WNV real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. WNV IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in %9.2 (8/87) and 3.4% (3/87) of the serum samples, respectively. All IgG reactive samples were negative for IgM. All sera with WNV antibody reactivity (n = 11) and the corresponding CSF samples were negative for viral RNA via RT-PCR. In 5 of the 8 WNV IgM positive subjects, sandfly fever virus IgM antibodies were detected, which was also accompanied by Dengue virus IgM positivity in one sample. In another case, intrathecal antibody synthesis against measles virus was demonstrated. Two cases (2/87; 2.3%) with WNV IgM positivity as the only serologic marker were identified as probable WNV infections and clinical features were discussed. In conclusion, in order to fully understand the impact of WNV and/or other flavivirus infections in Turkey, epidemiology and ecological features of these agents need to established."

METHODS: Totally 208 high-risk women of child bearing age and 159 of their children aged 0 - 14 years were investigated. Their medical histories of blood donation or transfusion were collected, blood samples were taken and sera were separated for HIV test. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot assay were performed for HIV antibody. The Nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay amplifying gag gene p17 was performed on samples of children aged less than 18 months. RESULTS: Thirty-seven HIV infected cases were found among 159 children aged 0 - 14 years of whom 33 were infected by mother-to-child transmission (89.2%, 33/37), 3 by blood transfusion (8.1%, 3/37) and one by iatrogenic route (2.7%, 1/37). Sixty seven mothers who were seropositive for HIV and their 86 children who were born after 1992 were investigated, 33 cases of them were infected with HIV. The rate of vertical transmission was 38.4% (33/86). The HIV vertical transmission rate among mothers with AIDS (68.8%, 22/32) was significantly greater than that among mothers with asymptomatic HIV infection (20.4%, 11/54, P < 0.05). The number of children infected with HIV through vertical transmission increased from 1993 to 2001. Among 37 children infected with HIV, 12 cases developed AIDS and 4 of them died, of whom 2 cases died from tuberculosis. The morbidity of AIDS was 27.3% (9/33). Ninety three point nine percent (31/33) of infected mothers didn't know their HIV seropositive status before pregnancy and delivery. Of 8 pregnant women infected with HIV, one had aggravation of AIDS, 2 miscarried, 2 terminated their pregnancy and 3 continued their pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Mother-to-child transmission of HIV was the major route of HIV/AIDS transmission to the children. The main reason leading to HIV infection in children was the lack of prenatal HIV counseling and testing for the high-risk women of childbearing age and lake of interventions. The countermeasures must be taken to control the further transmission of AIDS in order to protect the health of women and children in the highly endemic areas of AIDS."

Serum antibody responses to C. difficile toxins in correlation with organism carriage are not described in IBD. This study determines the prevalence of C. difficile carriage and compares serum antibody responses to C. difficile toxins in pediatric outpatients with IBD and controls. METHODS: Fecal and serum samples were prospectively collected from pediatric outpatients with IBD (n = 85) and age-matched controls (n = 78). Initial and follow-up stool samples were tested using cytotoxigenic C. difficile culture and PCR to detect the toxin B gene. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis determined the strain type. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay determined serum immunoglobulin responses to C. difficile toxins. RESULTS: Asymptomatic C. difficile carriage was significantly greater in IBD (17%) versus controls (3%) (P = 0.012). IBD type, disease severity, IBD therapy, recent antibiotics, and hospitalizations were not associated with carriage. Proton pump inhibitor use was significantly higher in patients with C. difficile carriage (54% versus 25%, P < 0.05). North American pulsed-field (NAP) strain carriage varied over time in patients colonized with C. difficile. A significantly greater proportion of patients with IBD had a positive serum antibody response to toxin A (69%) compared with controls (53%) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic toxigenic C. difficile carriage was increased in pediatric outpatients with IBD compared with controls. Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with increased carriage. Antibody responses to C. difficile toxins were increased in IBD, potentially promoting asymptomatic colonization. Future studies should identify the risk factors for symptomatic C. difficile in pediatric IBD."

However, it remains unclear whether the intense release of cfDNA into the bloodstream of NSCLC patients results from malignancy or chronic inflammatory response. Consequently, the current diagnostic utility of plasma cfDNA quantification has not been thoroughly validated in subjects with chronic respiratory inflammation. Here we assess the effect of chronic respiratory inflammation on plasma cfDNA levels and evaluate the potential clinical value of this phenomenon as an early lung cancer diagnostic tool. METHODS: We measured plasma cfDNA concentrations in 50 resectable NSCLC patients, 101 patients with chronic respiratory inflammation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sarcoidosis, or asthma) and 40 healthy volunteers using real-time PCR. RESULTS: We found significantly higher plasma cfDNA levels in NSCLC patients than in subjects with chronic respiratory inflammation and healthy individuals (P<0.0001). There were no significant differences in plasma cfDNA levels between patients with chronic respiratory inflammation and healthy volunteers. The cutoff point of >2.8ngml(-1) provided 90% sensitivity and 80.5% specificity in discriminating NSCLC from healthy individuals (area under the curve (AUC)=0.90). The receiver-operating characteristics curve distinguishing NSCLC patients from subjects with chronic respiratory inflammation indicated 56% sensitivity and 91% specificity at the >5.25-ngml(-1) cutoff (AUC=0.76). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that elevated plasma cfDNA levels in NSCLC resulted primarily from tumour development rather than inflammatory response, raising the potential clinical implications for lung cancer screening and early diagnosis. Further research is necessary to better characterise and identify factors and processes regulating cfDNA levels in the blood under normal and pathological conditions."

Although their appearance was dependent upon an elevated hormonal level, E2 was not required for their production, as they also were induced by immunization with Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a component of complete Freund's adjuvant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molecular techniques, including ribonuclease protection assays and quantitative RT-PCR, were used to provide further characterization of CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) cells. Moreover, we determined the developmental requirements of the CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) cells using genetically modified mice and extensive flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: Characterization of CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) mRNA profile revealed highly elevated levels of CD16, CD44, CCR3, IP-15, and IL-13 transcripts compared with their CD45(high)VLA-4(+) counterparts. Furthermore, we found up-regulation of anti-apoptotic bcl-w and bcl-xl genes and transcripts encoding the TCRalpha and CD8alpha homodimer. The production of CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) cells was evident in nude mice and in MHC class II- and beta2-microglobulin, but not in CD1-deficient mice, suggesting a crucial role for CD1 in their induction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) cells might resemble natural killer T cells and imply possible roles for IL-13 and IP-15 in the protective function of CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) cells. A better understanding of how these cells, also occurring naturally during pregnancy, suppress the harmful immune response of EAE may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to combat multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases."

These methods are time-consuming and sometimes have a low level of accuracy. In addition, in some cases obtaining samples for smear and culture involves invasive procedures; while in other cases there is no suitable sample for evaluation. Therefore, there is a need for faster and more accurate diagnostic methods. Objectives: The current study investigated the diagnostic value of tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (TB-PCR) of urine in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Patients and Methods: This case-control study included; 77 proven pulmonary tuberculosis cases (according to the national TB protocol), and 30 subjects who were completely healthy. The urine samples (50 mL) were mixed with 0.5 mL Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid. DNA extraction and PCR testing were performed on all blood samples using SI 6110 primers. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also cultivated in the sputum and urine samples of the patients. Results: Results of the current study indicated that 48 (62.3%) patients out of 77 had a positive sputum culture. Urine cultures and acid-fast smears were negative. Urine PCR-TB was positive in 48.0% (37/77) of the patients. The specific TBPCR complex was positive in 56.2% (27/48) of the positive cultures and 34.4% (10/29) of the negative culture PTB patients. The control group had negative urine PCR (sensitivity 56.2% and specificity 100%). Conclusions: With regard to the ease of urine sample preparation and the 100% specificity the PCR method, performing urine PCR could be used as a diagnostic aid in PTB cases obtaining sputum samples is problematic.  2014, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences; Published by Kowsar Corp."

There are no clinical or radiographic characteristics typical of cryptococcal pneumonia, and its clinical and radiological presentations often overlap with other diagnoses. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of a 25-year-old man from Ghana admitted for an altered mental state, weight loss, neck pain, fever, and photophobia. He was diagnosed with Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis by cerebrospinal fluid culture and with disseminated cryptococcal infection by a positive Cryptococcus blood test. Diffuse micronodular opacities were found in a miliary pattern in the upper portions of both lungs upon imaging, which suggested miliary tuberculosis; thus, the patient was started on antituberculosis therapy. The patient underwent flexible fiber optic bronchoscopy, and transbronchial biopsy of the right lung showed bronchopneumonia with fungal spores consistent with filamentous Cryptococcus neoformans, which grew in tissue culture of the right lung. Interferon-gamma release assay, Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR, and acid-fast bacilli staining of the bronchoalveolar lavage were negative for the M. tuberculosis complex. CONCLUSION: The similarities in clinical and imaging findings among patients with acute immunodeficiency syndrome with coinfections make diagnoses difficult; thus image-guided biopsies are essential to confirm diagnoses."

Upon re- encounter with the nominal antigen, CD45RO+ T-cells are able to convert to CD8+CD45RA+CD28-T-cells displaying potent immune effector functions, including TNF-alpha production. This T-cell subpopulation constitutes a minor population in healthy individuals. In the present study we are currently evaluating whether this particular T-cell subset in PBL represents CD8+T-cells which may be able to recognize cervical cancer associated antigens provided by HPV 16 E7. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Flow-cytometric cell sorted CD8+CD45RA+CD28- and CD8+CD45RA+CD28-T-cells were obtained from patients with cervical cancer and tested for recognition of HLA-A2 restricted peptides derived from the human papillomavirus (HPV)16-E7 gene product using ELISA. HPV DNA in tumor tissue was detected by PCR. RESULTS: We show that the effector CD8+CD45RA+CD28-T-cell subset is expanded in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from patients with cervical cancer, but also in PBL from patients with an acute mycobacterial infection. CD8+T-cells from 3/6 cancer patients showed a peptide-specific immune response which could be segregated in peptide epitopes which elicited either a strong TNF-alpha production, or GM-CSF and IL-2 secretion. Peptide-reactivity could exclusively be detected in the ex vivo freshly isolated CD8+CD45RA+CD28-T-cell population. A similar situation was found to be true for HLA-A2 presented peptide epitopes derived from M. tuberculosis-associated antigens presented to T-cells obtained from patients with tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: The sorting of CD8+CD45RA+CD28-T-cells enables to determine the fine specificity of CD8+ effector T-cells without the need for in vitro manipulation and aids to define the most appropriate target epitopes for novel vaccine designs."

We used experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) to determine whether the discoordinate regulation of ANF and BNP was specific to the situations above or was generally associated with other types of myocardial inflammation. The dependency of this process to angiotensin signaling was also determined, given that previous work demonstrated beneficial effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker olmesartan in myocarditis. Histopathological changes, plasma and cardiac ANF, BNP, and selected cytokines gene expression as well as plasma cytokine levels using a cytokine array were determined in EAM, angiotensin receptor blocker-treated, and control rats. It was found that EAM specifically increases BNP but not ANF circulating levels, thus mimicking the findings in acute cardiac allograft rejection and the effect of some proinflammatory cytokines on cardiocyte cultures in vitro. Plasma cytokine array and real-time PCR revealed that lipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 were increased in plasma and in the myocardium of EAM rats. Olmesartan treatment reversed virtually all neuroendocrine and histopathological cardiac changes induced by EAM, thus providing a mechanistic insight into this phenomenon.

The airborne route is considered the most common for transmission of M. bovis, and more than 15% of cattle with bTB shed the Mycobacterium, which can be detect by nested PCR to amplify mycobacterial mpb70 from a nasal swab from a cow. To screen for cytokines fostering early and accurate detection of bTB, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from naturally M. bovis-infected, experimentally M. bovis 68002-infected, and uninfected cattle, then these cells were stimulated by PPD-B, CFP-10-ESAT-6 (CE), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 6h. The levels of interferon gamma (IFN-), IFN--induced protein 10 (IP-10), IL-6, IL-12, IL-17A, and tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA were measured using real-time PCR. To explore the cytokines associated with different periods of M. bovis infection, cattle were divided into three groups: PCR-positive, PCR-negative, and uninfected using the tuberculin skin test, CFP-10/ESAT-6/TB10.4 protein cocktail-based skin test, IFN- release assay (IGRA), CFP-10/ESAT-6 (CE)-based IGRA, and nested PCR. The expression of IP-10, IL-17A, and IFN- proteins induced by PPD-B, CE, or PBS was detected by ELISA. The results showed that levels of PPD-B-stimulated IL-17A and IP-10 (mRNA and protein), and CE-induced IP-10 (mRNA and protein) were significantly higher in cattle naturally or experimentally infected with M. bovis than in those that were uninfected. The levels of PPD-B- or CE-induced IL-17A and IP-10 (protein) could be used to differentiate M. bovis-infected calves from uninfected ones for 6 to 30weeks post-infection, whereas PPD-B- and CE-induced IP-10 and IL-17A mRNA expression could be used to differentiate M. bovis-infected calves from uninfected ones between 6 and 58weeks post-infection. However, CE-induced IL-17A (protein) was not a reliable indicator of M. bovis infection in cattle that were confirmed positive for infection by nested PCR. Furthermore, the levels of PPD-B- or CE-induced IP-10 and IL-17A protein were lower than IFN- in M. bovis-infected cattle. Therefore, IL-17A and IP-10 protein are not suitable biomarkers for bTB. Antigen-induced IP-10 mRNA should be analyzed further for their potential to be used in the diagnosis of bTB."

METHODS: The fusion gene encoding Hsp65-hIL-2 was cloned into shuttle vector pSMT3. The recombinant plasmid pSMT3-Hsp65-hIL-2 was transferred to Mycobacterium smegmatis by electroporation. Positive clones were selected by hygromycin and identified by PCR. The expression of fusion protein Hsp65-hIL-2 was verified using indirect immunofluorescence staining. Mice were immunized for two times by subcutaneously injection with 110(6) CFU rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 at a three-week interval. Two weeks after the second immunization, mice were sacrificed and the serum samples were collected for determination of anti-Hsp65 specific IgG. Splenic lymphocytes were isolated and treated with the rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 to determine lymphocytic proliferation activity by MTT assay. IFN-- and IL-2 in the medium of the treated cells were also determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Successful construction of rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 was verified by PCR and immunofluorescence staining. Compared to the splenic lymphocytes isolated from mice immunized with Bacille Calmette-Guerin or mice immunized with Mycobacterium smegmatis alone, the splenic lymphocytes isolated from mice immunized with rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 showed a marked increase in the proliferation of lymphocytes, together with an increased production of important cytokines such as IFN--and IL-2. CONCLUSIONS: rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 markedly enhances lymphocyte function. Therefore, the fusion protein generated by rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 may be of potential value in generating an effective vaccine against tuberculosis."

Although these infections are commonly caused by Candida and Aspergillus species, infections caused by Mucoralean fungi are also on a growing trend. The definitive diagnosis of mucormycosis includes visualization of non-septate hyphae on pathology or growth of Mucoralean fungi culture. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to diagnose mucormycosis from paraffin blocks; however, it yields discrepant results in diagnosis of mucormycosis from blood samples. In the current study, we sought to examine the efficiency of PCR test for the diagnosis of mucormycosis and aspergillosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with suspected fungal sinus infection were recruited from the Hematology-Oncology unit in Taleghani Hospital, Tehran, Iran. DNA was extracted and semi-nested PCR was performed. RESULTS: PCR was reported negative for all the 31 serum samples. Our assay had a sensitivity of 1.3 ng and 12 pg for Mucoralean and Aspergillus species, respectively. CONCLUSION: Using serum PCR, we detected Aspergillus and Mucoralean species in patients with suspected fungal sinus infection. While this test may have utility in diagnosis directly from biopsy site, it appears unreliable for use as a noninvasive blood test."

The total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood leucocytes cultured with PHA mitogen stimulation. Then bovine IFN-gamma (BovIFN-gamma) gene cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pET28a to obtain the expression plasmid designated as pETBovIFN-gamma. The pETBovlFN-gamma was further transformed into competent E. coli BL21 cells and a 18kD His-tagged protein as expected was expressed after IPTG induction. By using purified recombinant BovIFN-gamma as antigen and lymphocyte-hybridoma technique, four hybridoma cell lines which stably secreted monoclonal antibodies against rBovIFN-gamma were generated, designated as A7, A10, G6, and G10. The immunoglobin subset was identified as IgG1 . Western-blotting analysis and ELISA demonstrated that the monoclonal antibodies secreted by all the four hybridoma cell lines could react specifically to the recombinant BovIFN-gamma, but not irrelative proteins such as Ag85B, ESAT-6-CFP-10 and GM-CSF, suggesting that the four hybridoma cell lines were rBovIFN-gamma specific monoclonal antibodies. A sandwich ELISA was established by using A10 secreted monoclonal antibody and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against BovIFN-gamma, HRP labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. The results indicated that the sensitivity was 2ng/mL. This sandwich ELISA to detect BovIFN-gamma paved the way to develop a sensitive method for specific infection detection such as bovine tuberculosis diagnosis."

Human susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and tuberculosis, shows allelic association with a highly polymorphic regulatory, Z-DNA-forming microsatellite of (GT/AC)n dinucleotides within the proximal SLC11A1 promoter. We surmised that cis-acting allelic polymorphisms may underlie heritable differences in SLC11A1 expression and phenotypic variation in disease risk. However, it is unclear what may underlie such variation in SLC11A1 allele expression. Here we show that hypoxia-inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) regulates allelic variation in SLC11A1 expression by binding directly to the microsatellite during macrophage activation by infection or inflammation. Targeted Hif-1alpha ablation in murine macrophages attenuated Slc11a11 expression and responsiveness to S typhimurium infection. Our data also showed that HIF-1 may be functionally linked to complex prototypical inflammatory diseases associated with certain SLC11A1 alleles. As these alleles are highly polymorphic, our finding suggests that HIF-1 may influence heritable variation in SLC11A1-dependent innate resistance to infection and inflammation within and between populations. This report also suggests that microsatellites may play critical roles in the directional evolution of complex heritable traits by regulating gene expression phenotypes."

Nested-PCR method showed higher sensitivity in patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis (47.8% and 52% in blood and urine) when compared to patients with the pulmonary form of the disease (sensitivity of 29% and 26.9% in blood and urine), regardless of the type of biological sample used. The nested-PCR is a rapid technique that, even if not showing a good sensitivity, should be considered as a helpful tool especially in the extrapulmonary cases or in cases where confirmatory diagnosis is quite difficult to be achieved by routine methods. The performance of PCR-based techniques should be considered and tested in future works on other types of biological specimens besides sputum, like blood and urine, readily obtainable in most cases. The improving of M. tuberculosis nested-PCR detection in TB affected patients will give the possibility of an earlier detection of bacilli thus interrupting the transmission chain of the disease."

Among the genes that may play a role in the occurrence of COPD and lung cancer are those encoding the proteolytic enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors. The objective of this study was to find MMPs-associated markers useful in the identification of COPD subjects with increased susceptibility to developing lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes coding for matrix proteinases (MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, MMP12) as well as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP1) in two groups of subjects: COPD patients (54 subjects) and COPD patients diagnosed for lung cancer occurrence (53 subjects).The levels of the respective proteins in blood serum were also analyzed. RESULTS: The frequencies of 2 genotypes, MMP3 rs3025058 and MMP3 rs678815, were significantly different between the studied groups. In both cases, more heterozygotes and less homozygotes (both types) were observed in the COPD group than in the COPD + cancer group. A significantly higher TIMP1 level in blood serum was observed in the COPD + cancer group than in the COPD group. There were no statistically significant differences in MMPs blood levels between the studied groups. In addition, no genotype-associated differences in TIMP1 or MMPs blood levels were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Homozygocity for MMP3 rs3025058 and rs678815 polymorphisms is a potential marker of enhanced susceptibility to lung cancer development among COPD subjects."

The procedure was validated on 55 samples selected for tuberculosis based on clinical criteria. 52 patients had radiological changes indicative of pulmonary tuberculosis of which only 28 were positive for AFB in sputum (sensitivity 54%) and 27 for tuberculin (sensitivity 52%). 26 HIV positive patients who showed positive X-ray did not react to tuberculin. The genus PCR probe missed 3 samples (sensitivity 94%) compared to X-ray. M.tuberculosis was detected in the blood of all X-ray positive cases by PCR using TB400 probe (sensitivity 100%) and another probe for Af. tuberculosis, IS6110, missed 6 of them (sensitivity 88% compared to X-ray and 89% compared to TB400). It is proposed that this simple sample processing method could be used to screen all blood samples quickly for mycobacteremia using the genus PCR and only those positive for mycobacteria need to be tested for M. tuberculosis. This would save the scarce resources and time by reducing significantly the number of samples to be screened for species confirmation."

However, the cause is often difficult to establish and the studies are limited. We studied the etiology of GIN and compared the clinical and histological features and outcome in different etiologies at a tertiary care center in North India. Methods: Rena biopsies fromGIN cases diagnosed fromJanuary 2004 to April 2014were retrieved. Stain for acid fast bacilliwas performed in all biopsies. Etiological diagnosis was based on clinical features, extra-renal manifestations, radiology, history of drug intake and demonstration of infective agent. Tissue PCR for tubercular DNA was performed in seven biopsies. Results: Seventeen GIN patients [mean age 35  15 years; males 11] were identified. Tuberculosis was the commonest etiology followed by idiopathic, sarcoidosis and fungal. Both tuberculosis and sarcoidosis patients presented with subnephrotic proteinuria and raised serum creatinine. Acid fast bacilli were demonstrated in 1/9 and necrosis was demonstrated in 3/9 granulomas in tuberculosis. Tissue PCR for tubercular DNA was positive in six TB patients and negative in one sarcoidosis patient. Patients responded well to appropriate therapy. Conclusion: Etiological diagnosis of GIN is essential for timelyand appropriate therapy. Tuberculosis is the commonest etiology (53%) in the tropics. Necrosis in granuloma, demonstration of acid fast bacilli, blood interferon gamma release assay and urine culture is not sensitive for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in GIN.

Seventy-six participants had a clinical diagnosis of TB which were confirmed by a positive culture. CD4 T-cell responses were measured after stimulation with a pool of overlapping peptides covering RD-1 antigens: CFP-10+ESAT-6. The performance of the assay was also compared to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The overall sensitivity of the OX40 assay was 94.7% (95%CI 87.1-98.5); its specificity was 71.9% (95%CI, 58.5-83). The sensitivity of the OX40 assay among HIV-infected participants was 100% (95%CI, 88.8-100) with a specificity of 92.9% (95%CI, 66.1-99.8). OX40 assay performed particularly well in those with active TB and HIV infection."

In the PEC on day 7 after infection, approximately 26% of the CD3+ cells were CD4-CD8-, most of which expressed TCR gamma/delta on their surface. However, the PEC on day 28 contained an increased number of alpha/beta T cells that were CD4+8- or CD4-8+ and the proportion of gamma/delta T cells in the PEC reciprocally decreased to 18% of the CD3+ cells. The kinetics of gamma/delta and alpha/beta T cells in the LN during BCG infection showed in much the same pattern as that seen in the PEC. When purified CD4-CD8- cells in the LN on day 7 after BCG infection were cultured with sonicated BCG lysate, PPD derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis or recombinant 65 kDa heat shock protein derived from Mycobacterium bovis, the gamma/delta T cells on this stage significantly proliferated and secreted IL-2 in response to sonicated BCG lysate and PPD but not to 65 kDa heat shock protein. V gene segment usage analysis with PCR method revealed that purified protein derivative-reactive gamma/delta T cells preferentially used V gamma 1/2/V delta 6, whereas gamma/delta T cells polyclonally expanded in response to the BCG lysate. These results suggest that gamma/delta T cells specific for mycobacterial antigens preceding alpha/beta T cells in appearance during infection may serve as a first line of defense against mycobacterial infection."

AIMS: Differential diagnosis of paratuberculosis and TB in blood samples of cattle and buffaloes. METHODS: In this study, an in-house developed multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting MAP, Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium smegmatis was used in blood samples (buffy coat) parallel with IS900 PCR and esxB PCR for diagnosis of paratuberculosis and TB, respectively; in a total of 202 cattle and buffaloes. RESULTS: Out of 202 animals, 12 (5.9%) and 17 (8.4%) animals were positive for MAP by multiplex PCR and IS900 PCR, respectively; from which only 8 (4%) animals were positive by both tests; whereas 4 and 9 animals were exclusively positive by multiplex PCR and IS900 PCR, respectively. None of the animals were found to be positive for M. bovis and M. smegmatis by the multiplex PCR. However, the esxB PCR detected 13 (6.4%) animals positive for TB. In fact, 3 (1.5%) animals were found to be co-infected by both paratuberculosis and TB. CONCLUSION: The in-house multiplex PCR detected MAP in buffy coat and there was a fair degree of agreement between the multiplex PCR and IS900 PCR in detection of MAP DNA though the latter detected more number of animals to be positive for MAP. Besides, esxB PCR showed a high diagnostic potential and can be used for diagnosis of TB from blood."

Cerebrospinal fluid culture was negative for fungi and bacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis. Negative results for PCR and ELISA made herpes simplex virus encephalitis unlikely. We treated him empirically with aciclovir and cefpirome, conducting further tests because a HIV serological test was positive on admission. HIV RNA was 2.9 x 10(5) copies/ml in the blood. Western blot analysis demonstrated positive bands at gp160, p24, p55, and p68, but negative at gp120, p52, gp41, p40, p34, and p18. These results yielded a definitive diagnosis of acute primary HIV infection presenting as meningoencephalitis. His clinical condition improved over the next few days. Repeated MRI showed a new lesion in the pons on T2-weighted images. No MRI abnormality has reported previously in acute primary HIV infection with meningoencephalitis. High signal intensity in the bilateral globus pallidus and the pons in patients with meningoencephalitis may thus be a useful indicator for acute primary HIV infection."

The positive results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in endometrial GTB in the absence of tubal damage raise the possibility of the detection of sub-clinical or latent disease, with doubtful benefits of treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and Non-tubercular Mycobacterium (NTM) infection by using Real-PCR technique in the menstrual blood samples of 120 unexplained infertile women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 120 infertile women with unexplained infertility aged 20-35 yr old and normal hysterosalpingography findings were taken. Menstrual blood in the first 12 hr of menstruation containing the endometrial tissues from each participant was tested for MTB and NTM by Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: Among the selected 120 patients, only two were found to be positive for MTB infection. All remaining participants were negative for MTB infection. All participants were negative for NTM infection at the endometrium. CONCLUSION: Although, studies have indicated that PCR is a useful method in diagnosing early GTB disease in infertile women with no demonstrable evidence of tubal or endometrial involvement, our study showed that GTB is not the major problem in women with unexplained infertility."

The present study was designed to demonstrate the diagnostic usefulness of a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, specific for the IS6110 insertion element of M. tuberculosis complex, in patients with ascites who were suspected of having TP in order to achieve a more timely diagnosis and treatment. Methods: Three HIV-negative patients suffering from fever and ascites were evaluated for suspected TP. Specimens were obtained from ascitic fluid, bone marrow, and peripheral blood and analyzed by both conventional methods and nested PCR for the presence of bacilli. Response to antituberculous treatment was considered as the final criterion for diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis. Results: All three patients had an excellent response to antituberculous therapy. Our PCR-based protocol detected M. tuberculosis complex DNA in the ascitic fluid of all patients, whereas conventional methods failed to establish the disease. Furthermore, in one patient, M. tuberculosis was also detected in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. Conclusions: PCR amplification of the IS6110 sequence of M. tuberculosis complex in ascitic fluid is a useful tool when peritoneal tuberculosis is suspected. However, its validity still needs to be established.  2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

We show here that CD4+ TCR alphabeta+ T cells are capable of recognizing the mycobacterial heat shock protein (HSP) 70, that appears in the peritoneal cavity of F344 rats infected i.p. with L. monocytogenes. The HSP70-reactive CD4+ T cells recognized a peptide comprising 234-252 residues as present in the 70 kDa HSP of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the context of RT1.B MHC class II molecules. Analysis of TCR Vbeta gene expression with RT-PCR revealed that the HSP70-reactive CD4+ T cells predominantly used the Vbeta16 gene segment, whereas the heat-killed Listeria (HKL)-specific T cells expressed a diverse set of Vbeta gene segments. In contrast to the HKL-specific T cells producing IFN-gamma, the HSP70-reactive CD4+ T cells produced TGF-beta1 and IL-10 but neither Th1- or Th2-type cytokines. Adoptive transfer with HSP70-reactive T cells rendered rats susceptible to listerial infection. Collectively, these results proposed that the HSP70-reactive CD4+ T cells appearing during rat listeriosis may be involved in termination of Th1 cell-mediated excessive inflammation after the battle against L. monocytogenes has been won."

Malaria also continues to be a global public health threat. Due to marked epidemiological overlap in the global burden of TB and malaria, co-infection does occur. An HIV-infected, 32-year-old male presented with a two-week history of headache with fevers to Mulago National Referral Hospital, Uganda. Five months prior, he was diagnosed with pulmonary TB. He endorsed poor adherence to anti-tuberculous medications. Mycobacterium tuberculosis in CSF was confirmed on Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra. On day 2, he was initiated on dexamethasone at 0.4mg/kg/day and induction TB-medications were re-commenced (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide) for TBM. He continued to spike high-grade fevers, a peripheral blood smear showed P. falciparum parasites despite a negative malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT). He received three doses of IV artesunate and then completed 3 days of oral artemether/lumefantrine. To our knowledge this is the first published case of HIV-TBM-malaria co-infection. TBM/malaria co-infection poses a number of management challenges. Due to potential overlap in symptoms between TBM and malaria, it is important to remain vigilant for co-infection. Access to accurate parasitological diagnostics is essential, as RDT use continues to expand, it is essential that clinicians are aware of the potential for false negative results. Anti-malarial therapeutic options are limited due to important drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Rifampicin is a potent enzyme inducer of several hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, this induction results in reduced plasma concentrations of several anti-malarial medications. Despite recognition of potential DDIs between rifampicin and artemisinin compounds, and rifampicin and quinine, no treatment guidelines currently exist for managing patients with co-infection. There is both an urgent need for the development of new anti-malarial drugs which do not interact with rifampicin and for pharmacokinetic studies to guide dose modification of existing anti-malarial drugs to inform clinical practice guidelines."

METHODS: CEA and CK19 mRNAs in peripheral blood were detected by Taq Man reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 78 patients with lung cancer before and after treatment, 30 patients with benign lung diseases and 30 healthy subjects. Serum CEA and CYFRA21-1 levels were also measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the 78 patients with lung cancer before treatment. The patients were followed for 2 years. RESULTS: The positive rates of CEA mRNA and CK19 mRNA in patients with lung cancer were 69.2% (54/78) and 62.8% (49/78), respectively, which were significantly higher than those in patients with benign lung diseases and the healthy controls (P < 0.01). The positive rate of CEA mRNA was the highest in adenocarcinoma, while the positive rate of CK19 mRNA was the highest in squamous cell carcinoma. There was no statistically significant difference among different stages (P > 0.05), The positive rates of CEA mRNA and CK19 mRNA were higher than those of serum CEA and CYFRA21-1. The positive rates of CEA mRNA and CK19 mRNA decreased significantly after surgical operation, but there was no significant change after chemotherapy. The median survival time (MST) for patients with a positive CEA mRNA before chemotherapy was shorter than those with a negative CEA mRNA (8.5 month and 11.7 month, respectively). The MST for patients with a positive CK19 mRNA before chemotherapy was shorter than those with a negative CK19 mRNA (8.9 month and 12.3 month, respectively). The rate of relapse and metastasis was higher in patients (29.4%) with a positive CEA mRNA preoperatively than those with a negative CEA mRNA (7.7%). The rate of relapse and metastasis was also higher in patients with a positive CK19 mRNA preoperatively (18.8%) as compared to those with a negative PCR result (7.1%). CONCLUSIONS: CEA and CK19 mRNAs can be used as markers in the detection of tumor micrometastases in lung cancer, and in evaluating surgical response and prognosis. The results suggest that the gene markers are better than the serum ones, and therefore may be useful for the early diagnosis of lung cancer."

As libraries based on immunized camelids are time-consuming, costly and likely redundant for certain antigens, we describe the construction of a nave camelid VHHs library from blood serum of non-immunized camelids with affinity in the subnanomolar range and suitable for standard immune applications. This approach is rapid and recovers VHH repertoire with the advantages of being more diverse, non-specific and devoid of subpopulations of specific antibodies, which allows the identification of binders for any potential antigen (or pathogen). RNAs from a number of camelids from Saudi Arabia were isolated and cDNAs of the diverse vhh gene were amplified; the resulting amplicons were cloned in the phage display pSEX81 vector. The size of the library was found to be within the required range (10(7)) suitable for subsequent applications in disease diagnosis and treatment. Two hundred clones were randomly selected and the inserted gene library was either estimated for redundancy or sequenced and aligned to the reference camelid vhh gene (acc. No.ADE99145). Results indicated complete non-specificity of this small library in which no single event of redundancy was detected. These results indicate the efficacy of following this approach in order to yield a large and diverse enough gene library to secure the presence of the required version encoding the required antibodies for any target antigen. This work is a first step towards the construction of phage display-based biosensors useful in disease (e.g., TB or tuberculosis) diagnosis and treatment."

Antituberculosis drug hepatotoxicity (ATDH) is common in India. Isoniazid, a constituent of most anti- tuberculosis drug regimens, is metabolized by N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) enzymes. We therefore studied the association of some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these enzyme genes with ATDH. Methods. Allelic and genotypic frequencies at three SNP loci in the NAT2 gene (rs1799929, rs1799930 and rs1799931) and one locus (rs2031920) in the CYP2E1 gene were studied using restriction fragment length polymorphism in 33 patients who developed ATDH following an isoniazid- containing antituberculosis drug regimen and 173 healthy blood donors. After confirming adherence of the control data to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model, genotype and allele frequencies in the two groups were compared. Results. For SNP rs1799930 in the NAT2 gene, 7 (21%), 21 (64%) and 5 (15%) patients, and 93 (54%), 62 (36%) and 18 (10%) controls had GG, GA and AA genotypes, respectively (p=0.003; odds ratio [OR] for GA v. GG=4.50 [95% CI 1.80-11.22] and for AA v. GG=3.69 [1.05-12.93]). Allele frequency for G nucleotides for this SNP was 0.53 among patients and 0.72 among controls (OR 2.24 [1.31-3.84], p=0.007). The allele and genotype frequencies of the other NAT2 SNPs and the CYP2E1 SNP showed no significant difference between cases and controls. All the 33 patients and 151 (87%) of 173 controls had mutant allele at one or more of the three NAT2 SNP loci (p=0.03). The presence of two or more mutant alleles, a marker of slow acetylator status, was more frequent in patients (23/33 [70%]) than in controls (73/173 [42%]; OR 3.23 [95% CI 1.45-7.19], p=0.004). Conclusion. In India, the risk of ATDH is increased in persons with 'A' allele at SNP rs1799930 in the NAT2 gene, but is not associated with rs2031920 polymorphism in the CYP2E1 gene."

METHODS: A total of 44 consecutive serum specimens were collected from clinically suspected OTB patients, based on clinical and radiological [X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography] features. They were screened by in-house nested PCR. In addition, a few specimens were examined by Gram stain, acid-fast bacilli stain, histopathology and routine bacterial culture. A total of 39 specimens were collected from patients suffering from other bone diseases of nontuberculous origin and included as negative controls. RESULTS: Of the 44 clinically suspected OTB patients, in-house nested PCR was positive in 40 (91%) cases; PCR was negative in 38 (97%) negative controls. Sensitivity and specificity of our in-house nested PCR was 90.9% and 97.4%, respectively. The PCR report was available within 48 h. It was possible to standardize serum PCR technique and in positive cases, a good correlation was observed in terms of an adequate treatment response.

Comparing PTC and control groups before surgery showed a significant difference (P=0.01), while no significant difference was observed comparing them after surgery, in miR146-a (P=0.27). Our results depicted a higher miR-155-5p and miR-146a expression before surgery than after it (P<0.001 in both groups, for both miRs). We found a significant relationship between miR-222 and BRAFV600E mutation and significantly higher levels of miR-181a with increasing tumor size in PTC patients. CONCLUSION: miR-222 showed overexpression in all PTC cases, which is indicative of a relation between miRNA and PTC. Also, comparing miR-181 and miR-146a showed a significant difference between cancerous and benign cases. miR-155-5p as an inflammatory factor, showed no significant changes, comparing two groups."

The combined positivity rate of ET and MB, when compared with positivity rate in MB showed a positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of 100%, 68.7%, and 84%, respectively. The results of nested PCR using MB as sample alone showed good agreement with the nested PCR results of the combined samples. Conclusions: The hsp65 Nested PCR of MB can be used as a noninvasive screening test for early diagnosis of GTB.  2019 Journal of Human Reproductive Sciences."

There are not many studies on Bartonella infections from India. The present study was undertaken to diagnose B. henselae infection in diverse clinical conditions in a tertiary care hospital in north India. METHODS: A total of 145 patients including those with fever and lymphadenopathy, infective endocarditis and neuroretinitis were enrolled in the study. Whole blood, serum and lymph node aspirate and valvular vegetations if available, were obtained. Samples were plated on chocolate agar and brain-heart infusion agar containing five per cent fresh rabbit blood and were incubated at 35C for at least four weeks in five per cent CO(2)with high humidity. Immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) was done for the detection of IgM antibodies in the serum using a commercial kit. Whole blood was used to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the citrate synthase gene (gltA). RESULTS: IFA was positive in 11 of 140 (7.85%) patients and PCR was positive in 3 of 140 (2.14%) patients. Culture was negative in all the cases. A higher incidence of Bartonella infection was seen in patients with fever and lymphadenopathy (n=30), seven of whom were children. In ophthalmological conditions, four cases were IFA positive. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that the threat of Bartonella infection is a reality in India. It is also an important treatable cause of fever and lymphadenopathy in children. Serology and PCR are useful tests for its diagnosis. Clinicians should consider. BARTONELLA: infection in the differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses and chronic diseases."

Most guidelines for the diagnosis and management of TBM agree on the use of simple Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis using molecular tools like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). However, the sensitivity of PCR varies while using a CSF sample. In the present study, we have compared the diagnostic utility of PCR assay in both peripheral blood and CSF sample collected from TBM cases. AIM: To evaluate the application of the peripheral blood PCR assay as an alternate tool for TBM diagnosis compared to conventional CSF-PCR based system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 TBM patients were prospectively recruited from in patient department wards of Central India Institute of Medical Sciences (CIIMS) between January 2014 - Feburary 2015. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) specific IS6110 PCR and BactT liquid culture were performed in 20 of recruited cases classified as Stage 1, 2 and 3 based on British Medical Research Council (BMRC) contemporary clinical criteria for the severity of TBM. Clinical characteristics were summarised in terms of percentages for categorical variables, i.e., age groups, gender, signs and symptoms. All statistical analysis was carried out using MedCalc software version 11.6. RESULTS: Overall IS6110 PCR positivity in CSF was around 80% (16/20), which was higher than culture (29.3%) and peripheral blood (39%). Out of 8 positive cases, stage wise positivity of peripheral blood PCR assay in three TBM stages was 0% (stage1) 50% (stage 2) and 67% (Stage 3) respectively. Positivity of peripheral blood PCR was significantly more (86%) in patients with CSF culture/ IS6110 PCR positive for MTB infection with sensitivity and specificity of 50 and 100% respectively. Increased positivity rates of peripheral blood PCR was observed with decreased CSF/Blood sugar ratio in stage 3 cases, suggesting enhanced probability of mycobacterial blood dissemination in cases of TBM severity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that although the molecular diagnosis of TBM infection in CSF remains the method of choice, peripheral blood based PCR can be used as a good alternative to CSF in case of TBM severity where the repeated CSF collection may be needed. However, study demands further validation in large cohorts to justify the present hypothesis."

Sputum PCR was positive in all the 12 cases, of them blood PCR was positive in 9, Gomori methenamine silver stain (GMS) positive in 5 and Giemsa stain positive in 6 cases. The CD(4)(+) lymphocyte count was (5 approximately 155) x 10(6)/L, with a mean of (51 +/- 48) x 10(6)/L; the number of CD(4)(+) cells less than 100 x 10(6)/L in 10 cases (83%) with 9 cases (75%) less than 50 x 10(6)/L. The CD(4)(+)/CD(8)(+) ratio was 0.01 approximately 0.29. CONCLUSIONS: PCP was common in patients with advanced AIDS and often co-infected with other opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis. A diagnosis of PCP should be considered if sputum PCR is positive and typical clinical manifestations are present in patients with AIDS."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 541 cows of three dairy farms of Bareilly and Mukteshwar were screened by SITT followed by collection of pre-scapular lymph node (PSLN) aspirates (71), milk (54), and blood (71) samples from reactor animals. These clinical samples were processed for culture isolation and direct PCR-based identification and species differentiation. RESULTS: Out of 541 cows screened by SITT, 71 (13.12%) animals were found positive. Mycobacteria were isolated from 3 (4.22%) PSLN aspirate but not from any cultured milk and blood samples. 28 (39.43%) PSLN aspirate and 5 (9.25%) milk samples were positive for Mycobacterium TB (MTB) complex (MTC) by PCR amplification for the IS6110 insertion sequence; however, blood samples were found negative. For species differentiation, multiplex-PCR using 12.7 kb primers was conducted. Out of 28 PSLN aspirate, Mycobacterium bovis was detected in 18 (64.28%) and MTB in 8 (28.57%), whereas 2 aspirate samples (7.14%) were positive for both the species. All the five milk positive samples were positive for M. bovis. CONCLUSION: Direct detection of bovine TB by a molecular-based method in dairy animals after preliminary screening was appeared to be more sensitive and specific compared to the conventional method (i.e., culture isolation). Its application in form of serial testing methodology for the routine diagnosis and thereafter, culling of infected stock may be suggested for the control programs in dairy herds. The PSLN aspirate was found to be the most suitable specimen for culture isolation and PCR-based detection of Mycobacterium spp. among live infected animals."

In accordance with the ESC guidelines, this contribution intends to change this attitude. After therapeutic or diagnostic pericardiocentesis of 259 patients with large to moderate pericardial effusions, pericardial fluid, epicardial and pericardial biopsies, and blood samples were analysed by PCR for cardiotropic microbial agents. Cytology, histology, immunohistology of tissue and fluids and laboratory tests were performed. Of the 259 patients, 35 % suffered from an autoreactive aetiology, 28 % suffered from a malignant and 14 % from an infectious cause. Investigating all samples by PCR, we identified viral genomes in 51 (19.7 %) patients, parvovirus B19 (B19 V) being identified in 25 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in 19 cases. In patients with a sole infectious aetiology (n = 36), B19 V was detected in 21 and EBV in 10 cases. When differentiating with regard to the material investigated for the presence of cardiotropic viruses, parvovirus B19 was most often detected in the epicardium and EBV was most frequently detected in the pericardial fluid independent from the final diagnostic categorisation. Bacterial cultures including tests for tuberculosis were all negative. Molecular techniques improve sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy for the underlying aetiology in pericarditis patients with effusion. The identification of specific viral signatures will help to understand pathogenetic mechanisms in pericarditis and allow to tailor an adequate therapy beyond antiphlogistic treatment.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

The aim of this study was to detect Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) DNA by real time-PCR method in peripheral blood of symptomatic VL patient and compared its performance with nested PCR, an established molecular method with very high diagnostic indices. 47 parasitologically confirmed VL patients diagnosed by direct agglutination test (DAT>3200), bone marrow aspiration and presented characteristic clinical features (fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia) and 40 controls (non-endemic healthy control-30, Malaria-2, Toxoplasma gondii-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-2, HBV-1, HCV-1, HSV-1 and CMV-1) were enrolled in this study. SYBR-green based real time-PCR and nested PCR was performed to amplify the Kinetoplast DNA minicircle gene using the DNA extracted from Buffy coat. From among 47 patients, 45 (95.7%) were positive by both nested-PCR and real time-PCR. These results indicate that real time-PCR was not only as sensitive as a nested-PCR assay for detection of Leishmania kDNA in clinical sample, but also more rapid. The advantage of real time-PCR based methods over nested-PCR is simple to perform, more faster in which nested-PCR requires post-PCR processing and reducing contamination risk."

As the traditional diagnostic method delay the research because of low sensitivity and specificity, a rapid method of diagnosis is of outmost importance. Aim: The study was designed to evaluate the two rapid diagnostic methods of TB in cattle, further to differentiate between infected and bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinated animals. Materials and Methods: Intradermal tuberculin test was applied to 300 cattle. Of these cattle, 15 cattle were vaccinated from cattle negative to tuberculin test with BCG. Blood samples were taken for lymphocyte separation to apply polymerase chain reaction (PCR) upon and for serum preparation for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) application, this blood collected from 65 cattle classified into three groups, viz. positive tuberculin test (35 animals), negative tuberculin test (15 animals), and vaccinated cow with BCG (15 animals). From blood samples lymphocytes were separated and the isolated lymphocytes were subjected to PCR and serum for ELISA application. Blood samples, specimens from lymph nodes and specific tissues were taken for PCR and for cultivation and isolation of Mycobacterium bovis. Results and Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that PCR can be used as rapid efficient and accurate diagnostic test in detection of ruminant TB. Moreover, cattles ELISA reading showed higher sensitivity in positive tuberculin animals. However, the differentiations between vaccinated and infected animals not clear by using a single antigen only."

Among the most serious are fungal infections which are often life-threatening, and difficult to recognize and treat. We present a patient with severe pneumonia and pleural effusion, that developed during treatment of a soft tissue sarcoma with pulmonary metastases. CASE REPORT: A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the ITU because of marked dyspnoea, bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion. She was intubated and placed on a ventilator, and bilateral pleural drains were inserted. She also required vigorous inotropic support (dopamine + noradrenaline). CRP was 12.5-19.8 mg dL(-1) and procalcitonin was below 1 ng mL(-1)). Lung metastases and tuberculosis were excluded and fungal infection suspected. Aspergillus DNA was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage, and in blood serum (PCR). Amphotericin B and voriconazole were instituted, but without evident success, The girl was severely distressed, required mechanical ventilation with an F1O2 of 0.6, while her CRP increased to 28.4 mg dL(-1). The amphotericin was stopped and replaced with caspofungin, resulting in rapid improvement in her clinical status. The girl was extubated after 21 days of ventilation, however due to a very severe opioid withdrawal syndrome with extreme agitation, she was re-intubated. After a further two weeks on methadone and sedatives, she was extubated again, this time successfully, One month later she was discharged from the hospital, still on oral voriconazole. CONCLUSION: Fungal infection should always be considered in immunocompromised patients with clinical signs of systemic infection. Recognition and treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult and may require multi drug therapy."

The aim of the research was designed a novel DNA vaccine encoding the Mycobacterium tuberculosis secreted antigen Ag85A fused with the influenza A virus (IAV) HA2 protein to provide protection against both influenza and secondary infection with S. aureus. The DNA vaccine vector efficiently expressed the encoded antigen in mammalian cells, as determined by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence analysis. Mice were immunized with the vaccine by intramuscular injection before challenge with IAV and S. aureus. The pulmonary and the splenocyte culture IFN- levels were significant higher in immunized mice than their respective controls. Although the antibody titer in the HI test was low, the sera of mice immunized with the novel vaccine vector were effective in neutralisation assay in vitro. The vaccine could reduce the loss of body weight in mice during IAV challenge. Both Western blotting and RT-PCR showed that the vaccine markedly enhanced toll like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression in splenocytes after the secondary infection with S. aureus. The survival rate of mice with high TLR2 expression (pEGFP/Ag85A-HA2 or iPR) was significantly increased compared with mice immunized with pEGFP/HA2 after challenge with S. aureus. However, the pulmonary IL-10 concentration and S. aureus titer were significantly decreased in immunized mice, and expression of TLR2 was increased after challenge with S. aureus. These results demonstrated that Ag85A could strengthen the immune response to IAV and S. aureus, and TLR2 was involved in the host response to S. aureus."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and the specificity of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA and lung-specific X protein (LUNX) mRNA biomarkers in peripheral blood to detect lung cancer individually and simultaneously. METHODS: Thirty patients affected by lung cancer and 30 healthy individuals were studied in this research. Three vials of cDNA were made from each sample after taking peripheral blood samples and extracting total RNA. Each sample was examined by the real-time RT-PCR technique. The result from each vial was then compared with the sensitivity of overall marker. RESULTS: The CEA mRNA was positive in 24 out of 30 lung cancer patients. Hence, its sensitivity was determined at 80%, differing significantly from that observed in healthy individuals, where 11 positive cases were seen. The overall sensitivity of this marker was significantly associated with positivity in vials 2 and 3 but not in vial 1. The LUNX mRNA was positive in 21 out of 30 patients, indicating 70% sensitivity. This finding significantly differed from that in healthy individuals. The overall sensitivity of this marker was significantly associated with positivity in vials 1 and 3, but not in vial 2. In 93.3% of the patients, at least one positive marker was observed.

In cystic fibrosis, the cloning and identification of several mutations in the gene encoding the chloride channel transmembrane regulator (CFTR) have resolved several important issues in clinical practice: cystic fibrosis constitutes a molecular defect of a single gene. There is a strong correlation between the clinical manifestations or the severity of the disease (phenotype) with the type of mutations present in the CFTR gene (genotype). More recently, identification of mutations in the gene encoding a subunit of the renal sodium channel in the Liddle syndrome has provided important insight into the physiopathological understanding of mechanisms involved in this form of hereditary hypertension. Salt retention and secondary high blood pressure are the result of constitutive activation of the renal sodium channel by mutations in the gene encoding the renal sodium channel. It is speculated that less severe mutations in this channel could result in a less severe form of hypertension which may correspond to patients suffering from high blood pressure with low plasma renin activity. Several tools, most notably PCR, are derived from molecular research and are used in everyday practice, i.e. in prenatal diagnosis and in the diagnosis of several infectious diseases including tuberculosis and hepatitis. Finally, the production of recombinant proteins at lower cost and with fewer side effects is used in everyday clinical practice. Gene therapy remains an extraordinary challenge in correcting severe hereditary or acquired diseases. The use of genetically modified animal cell lines producing growth factors, insulin or erythropoetin, which are subsequently encapsulated and transferred to man, represents an attractive approach for gene therapy."

Previously we demonstrated that HSC quiescence and function are aberrant in mice lacking Irgm1. To investigate the molecular basis for these defects, we conducted microarray expression profiling of Irgm1-deficient HSCs. Cell-cycle and IFN-response genes are up-regulated in Irgm1(-/-) HSCs, consistent with dysregulated IFN signaling. To test the hypothesis that Irgm1 normally down-regulates IFN signaling in HSCs, we generated Irgm1(-/-)Ifngr1(-/-) and Irgm1(-/-)Stat1(-/-) double-knockout animals. Strikingly, hyperproliferation, self-renewal, and autophagy defects in Irgm1(-/-) HSCs were normalized in double-knockout animals. These defects were also abolished in Irgm1(-/-)Irgm3(-/-) double-knockout animals, indicating that Irgm1 may regulate Irgm3 activity. Furthermore, the number of HSCs was reduced in aged Irgm1(-/-) animals, suggesting that negative feedback inhibition of IFN signaling by Irgm1 is necessary to prevent hyperproliferation and depletion of the stem cell compartment. Collectively, our results indicate that Irgm1 is a powerful negative regulator of IFN-dependent stimulation in HSCs, with an essential role in preserving HSC number and function. The deleterious effects of excessive IFN signaling may explain how hematologic abnormalities arise in patients with inflammatory conditions."

This prospective study of surgical emergencies of tubercular abdomen was conducted in 50 patients who attended our surgical emergency from 2006 to 2008. Patients were evaluated thoroughly with history, physical examination, routine investigations, and special investigations such as ELISA, PCR, barium studies of gastrointestinal tract, and diagnostic laparoscopy as required and managed with medical and surgical treatment as necessary. The most of patients were from rural areas, in the third to sixth decades with slight male preponderance. Abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation were commonest presenting symptoms. About 20% patients had history of pulmonary tuberculosis and 16% patients presented with ascites. PCR for blood and ascitic fluid was positive in 72 and 87.5% patients, respectively. About 24% patients were managed nonoperatively and responded to ATT. About 76% patients needed surgery among which one-fifth of patients were operated in emergency. Procedures like adhesiolysis of gut (47.3%), strictureplasty (10.5%), resection anastomosis (5.2%), right hemicolectomy (5.2%), and ileotransverse anastomosis (7.8%) were performed in 30 patients and peritoneal biopsy and lymph node biopsy in the remaining 8 patients. Both medically and surgically managed patients were put on antitubercular therapy. Abdominal tuberculosis is a disease of middle-aged rural people, presenting commonly with abdominal pain and vomiting with right lower abdominal tenderness. PCR (blood and ascites) for tuberculosis is much more sensitive than IgM ELISA (blood and ascites). The most of patients required surgical procedures and all patients responded dramatically to antitubercular therapy symptomatically with increase in the hemoglobin level and decrease in ESR."

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 250 patients with systemic TB at a referral center in Chennai, South India from April 2016 to May 2019. Systemic workup comprised of Mantoux, chest X-ray, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and QuantiFERON (QFT) TB Gold. Aqueous humor analysis by nested PCR or real time PCR (RT-PCR) and ancillary ophthalmic investigations such as fundus fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography were performed. RESULTS: Multifocal choroiditis and vasculitis were the most common manifestations (39% and 24% respectively) together accounting for 61% of cases and they had a higher risk of recurrence (3%). Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) was more frequently associated with uveitis (18%). Among those with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), uveitis occured in miliary TB (2%), bone (1%) and abdominal TB (1%). Complications such as cystoid macular edema, choroidal neovascular membranes and macular scarring caused visual loss. Aqueous humor analysis detected mycobacterium TB antigen. Collectively, systemic investigations such as chest X-ray, Mantoux test and those performed on blood samples such as PCR and QFT were positive in 39% of patients. In inconclusive patients, nested PCR and/or RT-PCR were done on aqueous humor samples and were diagnostic in 96%. A combination of tests was diagnostic in 92%. ATT in isolation in 71% and combined with corticosteroids in 29% was used for treatment of which signs of resolution and improvement in vision started as early as 6wk in those who were started immediately on corticosteroids and ATT and longer than 3mo in those on ATT alone. Prompt treatment with ATT and corticosteroids improved vision in 23% of our patients within 2mo. Vitritis with choroiditis causes cystoid macular oedema and requires longer duration of ATT. Vision improved in 69%. Complete resolution occurred in 75% and worsening in 12%. CONCLUSION: A combination of investigations guided by clinical suspicion helps in precise diagnosis. In diagnostic dilemmas analysis of ocular samples is reliable and confirmatory. Screening all patients and a multidisciplinary approach in TB (active, healed or during treatment) is recommended."

In a cross-sectional study, 256 children with SCA and fever attending Mulago Hospital were recruited. Chest X-rays, blood cultures, complete blood count and sputum induction were performed. Sputum samples were investigated by Ziehl-Nielsen staining, culture and DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Chlamydia pneumoniae. Of the 256 children, 227% had ACS. Clinical and laboratory findings were not significantly different between children with ACS and those without, besides cough and abnormal signs on auscultation. Among the 83 sputum cultures Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%) and Moraxella spp (8%), were the commonest. Of the 59 sputa examined with DNA PCR, 593% were positive for Chlamydia pneumoniae. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in 6/83 sputa. These results show that one in 5 SCA febrile children had ACS. There were no clinical and laboratory characteristics of ACS, but cough and abnormalities on auscultation were associated with ACS. The high prevalence of Chlamydia pneumoniae in children with ACS in this setting warrants the addition of macrolides to treatment, and M.tuberculosis should be differential in sub-Saharan children with ACS."

Atypical manifestations of ocular syphilis and/or other associated opportunistic infections often lead to a diagnostic dilemma. We evaluated the utility of aqueous humor (AH) Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) titers in the diagnosis of ocular syphilis. Methods: Retrospective case series of five HIV positive patients with positive syphilis serology in whom AH sampling was performed. All patients had ocular manifestations suspicious of infectious etiology. Results: Panuveitis with/without retinitis was the commonest presentation. Along with blood investigations, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing from AH was done for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Toxoplasma gondii. In addition, serum antibody titers for Toxoplasma, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and TPHA tests for syphilis were done. In patients with raised serum RPR/TPHA, aqueous TPHA titers were also assessed. Mean serum RPR titer was  1:32 and TPHA titer was 1:1280. Aqueous humor titers of TPHA was high in all patients (range  1:320 to 1:5120). Aqueous PCR was negative for all other infectious etiologies in four patients. In one patient, PCR-CMV was also positive, suggestive of a dual infection. Post-treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and appropriate anti-syphilitic regime, complete resolution of lesions with corresponding fall in the serum RPR/TPHA titers were noted in all patients. Conclusions: Ocular syphilis with atypical presentations is usually diagnosed based on a positive syphilis serology and by excluding other infectious causes. In the present study, we have shown an excellent correlation between raised AH TPHA titers with serological values and the clinical presentation. Considering the ease of collection of AH in contrast to vitreous fluids, the AH-TPHA assay could potentially be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of ocular syphilis."

It considerably increases the risk of progressive obstructive lung diseases, mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is no data regarding prevalence of main, clinically most important A1ATD alleles PI*Z and PI*S in patients with pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH). PLCH is not only strongly linked to the cigarette smoking, but is also characterised by polycystic lung lesions. The goal of the study was to assess the incidence of A1ATD alleles in patients with PLCH. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 34 adult patients (14 women and 20 men), with histologically confirmed PLCH. AAT serum concentration was assessed by nephelometry and PI-phenotype, identified by isoelectrofocusing. The PI*S and PI*Z alleles were confirmed by genotyping usisng real-time PCR. RESULTS: Deficiency alleles PI*Z and PI*S were detected in 3 patients (one woman and 2 men), respectively in 5.88% and 2.94%. The estimated incidence of deficiency alleles was 29.4/1000 (95% CI; 10-69.5) for PI*Z and 14.7/1000(95%CI; 13.9-43.3) for PI*S. According to our previous reports, the expected prevalence of PI*Z and PI*S alleles in general Polish population was 13.7/1000 (95% CI 5.8-21.5), and 7,6/1000 (95% CI 1.7-13.5) respectively.

Plasmas from 29 healthy cohorts, 51 tuberculosis patients, and 79 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients were employed to evaluate the chemiluminescence immunoassay method performance for the clinical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. A commercial ELISA kit (Darui Biotech, China) using the same nucleocapsid antigen was used for the in-parallel comparison with our chemiluminescence immunoassay method. The IgM and IgG manner of testing in the chemiluminescence immunoassay method showed a sensitivity and specificity of 60.76% (95% CI 49.1 to 71.6) and 92.25% (95% CI 83.4 to 97.2) and 82.28% (95% CI 72.1 to 90.0) and 97.5% (95% CI 91.3 to 99.7), respectively. Higher sensitivity and specificity were observed in the chemiluminescence immunoassay method compared with the Darui Biotech ELISA kit. The developed high sensitivity and specificity chemiluminescence immunoassay IgG testing method combined with the RT-PCR approach can improve the clinical diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infections and thus contribute to the control of COVID-19 expansion."

Outcomes range from complete recovery through varying degrees of neurological disability which slowly resolve or remain permanent to death from either the acute illness or complications. Whilst bacterial meningitis accounts for a proportion of children affected, the aetiology in many remains unclear but includes malaria and probably viral encephalitis. Aim: To understand the aetiology, presentation and outcome of febrile encephalopathy in children in Papua New Guinea. Methods: Children aged between 1 month and 12 years presenting to Port Moresby General Hospital with febrile encephalopathy were studied prospectively. A detailed history and examination and the following laboratory investigations were undertaken as appropriate: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microscopy and bacterial culture, gram stain, measurement of protein and glucose and latex agglutination testing for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitides; Ziehl-Neelsen staining and india ink examination on selected samples; IgM for Japanese encephalitis, dengue, rubella and measles; PCR testing and mycobacterial culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Blood was tested for flavivirus, measles and rubella IgM and IgG. Results: 149 children were enrolled in the study. 129 had a lumbar puncture and CSF examination; 66 had a normal CSF white cell count. A clinical or laboratory-based diagnosis was possible for 140 children, but a definite pathogen was identifiable for only 55 (37%). The diagnoses included bacterial meningitis in 33 (S. pneumonia 16, H. influenza 13 and N. meningitides 4), tuberculous meningitis (5), probable tuberculous meningitis (18), malaria (10), cryptococcal meningitis (1), flavivirus encephalitis (5), rubella encephalitis (1), hepatic encephalopathy (1) and HIV encephalopathy (1). There were 28 cases of meningitis of unspecified aetiology. Of the five children with IgM-confirmed flavivirus encephalitis, one had dengue serotype 1 and two had Japanese encephalitis. Twenty-five children (including three of the five children with CSF flavivirus IgM) had serological IgG evidence of previous flavivirus infection. A history of multiple convulsions, the presence of neck stiffness and use of the Glasgow coma score (GCS) and TB score chart helped to identify children with bacterial meningitis and an adverse outcome and those with febrile convulsions. Conclusion: The study confirms the importance of S. pneumonia and H. influenza as major causes of febrile encephalopathy in children in Papua New Guinea. Flaviviruses including Japanese encephalitis are a cause of the febrile encephalopathy syndrome, as is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All children with febrile encephalopathy should have their GCS and TB scores recorded and should be examined for neck stiffness, and a history of the frequency of convulsions should be recorded. These basic clinical data can help to discriminate aetiology, to guide treatment and monitoring and to identify the children at highest risk of adverse outcome.  W. S. Maney & Son Ltd 2010."

The envelope (E) protein of JEV is the major antigen peptide fused to it. A recombinant hsp70 protein expression vector pPICZalpha-E-HSP70 in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris was developed that permits major antigenic segment of JEV E protein fused to the amino terminus of M. tuberculosis hsp70. This core vector avoided inclusion bodies formed in Escherichia coli and complex purification. Moreover,it ruled out contamination of LPS. Two other vectors pPICZalpha-E and pPICZalpha-HSP70 were also constructed. The two vectors were constructed by routine molecular technique. All vectors were transformed into yeast X-33 by electroporation. Expression of the fusion protein in yeast was induced by the addition of methanol every 24 hours and analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blot. Major antigenic segment of E protein was produced at a yield of 290 mg per litter of culture, hsp70 protein at a yield of 178 mg per litter of culture and E-HSP70 fusion protein at a yield of 33 mg per litter of culture in methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. To examine cell and body immune response after BALB/c mice were immunized with E-hsp70 fusion protein expressed in Pichia pastoris, there were three groups with ten mice in each group. 5.7 microg (50pmol) of E-hsp70 fusion protein, 2.2 microg (50pmol) major antigenic segment of E protein and a mixture of hsp70 and major antigenic segment of E protein (1:1) including 3.5 microg (50pmol) Hsp70 and 2.2 microg (50pmol) major antigenic segment of JEV E protein were used per mouse i.p. on day 0 and day 21. The production of mIL-2 was quantitated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Besides, proliferation of lymphocytes was measured by MTT and titers of antibody was determined by ELISA. These data show that the fusion protein is a more powerful antigen than major antigenic segment of JEV E protein. So it also illustrates the effectiveness of hsp70 in eliciting a humoral and cellular response to an attached molecule in the absence of adjuvant and affirms the potential utility of hsp70 in vaccine development."

We profiled the expression of 44 unique plasma miRNAs in training set of 34 NSCLC patients and 20 matched healthy individuals by miRCURY LNA Universal RT microRNA PCR Panel and calculated dysregulation fold changes using the 2-Ct equation. Selected plasma miRNAs were then validated by SYBR green q-RT PCR using an independent validation set of plasma samples from NSCLC patients (n: 72) and NC (n: 50). In the validation set, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for four miRNAs. In the training set, 17 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated and nine were down-regulated in the plasma from NSCLC patients versus matched normal controls. Four miRNAs (miR-21, miR-328, miR-375 and miR-141) were selected for validating their diagnostic value in the testing set. ROC plot analysis showed that a high specificity (98%) and sensitivity (82.7%) in miR-141 in comparing early NSCLC patient and controls. So among these four plasma miRNAs only miR-141 could be promising biomarkers for early detection of NSCLC. In addition to, we found a significant positive correlation between stage and miR-21 expression level (95% CI: 0.687-0.863; p-value<0.0001). Considering the accessibility and stability of circulating miRNAs, plasma miR-141 is a useful biomarker early detection of NSCLC as a supplement in future screening studies."

Interleukin17 (IL-17) is an important acquired immunity cytokine, which is mainly produced by CD4(+)TH17 cells. It can recruit neutrophils and macrophages to the infected site in the lungs. IL-23 is one of the most important inducers of IL-17. In the present study, the expressions of IL-23 and IL-17 were examined in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from subjects with latent tuberculosis infection (LTB) and newly diagnosed active tuberculosis patients (ATB). PBMCs were activated with purified protein derivative (PPD) for 72 hr. Activated cells were harvested, RNA was extracted, and cDNA was synthesized. IL-17 and IL-23 mRNA expressions were evaluated by real-time PCR. The frequency of Th17 cells was examined by flowcytometry. RESULTS: The expressions of IL-17 and IL-23 mRNA were lower in patients than subjects with LTB (P<0.05). The frequency of IL-17 producing CD4+ T cells in patients with active TB was lower than LTB subjects (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study might suggest that IL-17 and IL-23 play critical roles in the immune response against TB."

Central nervous system (CNS) TB includes clinical entities: tuberculous meningitis, intracranial tuberculoma, and clinical features of CNS TB in the elderly may be atypical, non-specific, and confused with concomitant age-related diseases. Atypical clinical manifestations of TB in older persons can result in delay in diagnosis and initiation of treatment. A 91-year-old woman was brought to our emergency department after her family noted her altered mental status. Chest computed tomography confirmed miliary opacities. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed elevated protein level, low glucose level, and a lymphocytic pleocytosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple welldefined enhancing lesions in the cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres and the pons, suggestive of tuberculomas. Smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum and aspirate. Based on the CSF and brain MRI findings and the sputum microbiology results indicating the presence of M. tuberculosis in the sputum and gastric aspirate, the patient was diagnosed with CNS tuberculoma. The onset of TB is mainly associated with decreased immunity; however, several other factors such as comorbidities, decreased activity, dysphagia, and malnutrition, which influence one another, also influence the development of TB in the elderly. Because the mortality rate of TB increases rapidly with age, reaching approximately 30 % among the elderly, early diagnosis is critical.  2020 The Author(s)"

The antigen encoded by the DNA vaccine vector was efficiently expressed in mammalian cells, as determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence analyses. Mice were immunized with the vaccine vector by intramuscular injection before challenge with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (PR8 virus). Sera and the splenocyte culture IFN- levels were significantly higher in immunized mice compared with the control mice. The novel vaccine group showed a high neutralization antibody titer in vitro. The novel vaccine vector also reduced the viral loads, increased the survival rates in mice after the PR8 virus challenge and reduced the alveolar inflammatory cell numbers. Sera IL-4 concentrations were significantly increased in mice immunized with the novel vaccine vector on Day 12 after challenge with the PR8 virus. These results demonstrated that short HA2 (sHA2) protein epitopes may provide protection against the PR8 virus and that Ag85A could strengthen the immune response to HA2 epitopes, thus, Ag85A may be developed as a new adjuvant for influenza vaccines."

We aimed to determine the distribution of NAT2 genotype in Thai TB patients and correlate their genotype with plasma isoniazid concentrations. METHODS: Blood samples from 55 newly diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis participants from 3 hospitals were collected to classify the subject by NAT2 genotype performed by the Multiplex Haplotype-Specific PCR method. Patients were grouped into three acetylators (fast, intermediate, and slow). On day 14 of TB treatment, the second blood sample was taken to estimate the peak plasma concentration at two hours after oral administration. INH plasma concentration was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-Ms/Ms) method. RESULTS: The NAT2 genotype distribution of fast, intermediate, and slow acetylator was 10.9%, 36.4%, and 52.7%, from 6, 20, 29 patients, respectively. The median (IQR) of INH plasma concentration at two hours post drug administration for these three genotypes were 0.75 (0.69, 0.86), 2.56 (2.12, 3.97), and 4.25 (3.56, 5.5) g/mL, from 4, 14, 12 cases, respectively. The INH plasma concentration at two hours after administration was significantly associated with body weight and NAT2 acetylator. CONCLUSIONS: The INH plasma concentration was found lower in fast than intermediate and slow acetylators. Body weight and NAT2 acetylator influenced INH plasma concentrations at two hours after drug administration. Therefore, the NAT2 genotype should be known before starting TB treatment to maximize therapeutic outcomes."

A non-sputum biomarker that identifies individuals at highest tuberculosis risk would allow targeted microbiological testing and appropriate treatment and also guide need for prolonged therapy. We determined the utility of a previously developed whole blood transcriptomic correlate of risk (COR) signature for (1) predicting incident recurrent tuberculosis, (2) tuberculosis diagnosis and (3) its potential utility for tuberculosis treatment monitoring in HIV-infected individuals. We retrieved cryopreserved blood specimens from three previously completed clinical studies and measured the COR signature by quantitative microfluidic real-time-PCR. The signature differentiated recurrent tuberculosis progressors from non-progressors within 3 months of diagnosis with an area under the Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-0.85) amongst HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Twenty-five of 43 progressors (58%) were asymptomatic at microbiological diagnosis and thus had subclinical disease. The signature showed excellent diagnostic discrimination between HIV-uninfected tuberculosis cases and controls (AUC 0.97; 95%CI 0.94-1). Performance was lower in HIV-infected individuals (AUC 0.83; 95%CI 0.81-0.96) and signature scores were directly associated with HIV viral loads. Tuberculosis treatment response in HIV-infected individuals on ART with a new recurrent tuberculosis diagnosis was also assessed. Signature scores decreased significantly during treatment. However, pre-treatment scores could not differentiate between those who became sputum negative before and after 2 months. Direct application of the unmodified blood transcriptomic COR signature detected subclinical and active tuberculosis by blind validation in HIV-infected individuals. However, prognostic performance for recurrent tuberculosis, and performance as diagnostic and as treatment monitoring tool in HIV-infected persons was inferior to published results from HIV-negative cohorts. Our results suggest that performance of transcriptomic signatures comprising interferon stimulated genes are negatively affected in HIV-infected individuals, especially in those with incompletely suppressed viral loads."

Eosinophilic peritonitis is a rare type of non-infection PD-related peritonitis. Eosinophilic peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients was first reported in 1967. The cause of eosinophilic peritonitis is obscure, however it may be related to some etiologies: (1) hypersensitivity to PD materials, including catheter or dialysate; (2) bacteria, fungal or mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Clinical investigations include asymptomatic cloudy PD effluent, fever, abdominal pain and eosinophil count elevate in PD effluent. Eosinophilic peritonitis is usually mild and self-limited. With the development of PD, more eosinophilic peritonitis cases and researches were reported. Here, we report a patient on CAPD with eosinophilic peritonitis. A 71-year-old female patient developed end-stage renal disease for 4 years and underwent CAPD (2 000 mL of 1.5% dialysis solution with four exchanges daily) for 5 months. With a history of unclean food, she was hospitalized for complaints of diarrhea, fever and cloudy peritoneal effluent for 10 days. Dialysis effluent showed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 1 980 cell/mm(3), with 60% polymorphonuclear cells. She was diagnosed as PD-related peritonitis, and therapy was initiated with intraperitoneal ceftazidime 1 g once a day and vancomycin 500 mg every other day. She was admitted to the hospital as the symptoms were not relieved. Her peripheral blood cell count showed a total WBC count of 6 940 cells/mm(3), 36.8% eosinophil. Her PD effluent analysis showed turbidity, total WBC count of 1 480 cells/mm(3), and 83% polymorphonuclear cells. Her dialysate bacteria culture, fungus culture, polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB-PCR), acid-fast stain were all negative. On admission day 4, the treatments were changed to levofloxacin 200 mg once a day and vancomycin 500 mg every other day. After two weeks of antibiotics treatment, patient's symptoms were not completely improved and her dialysis effluent remained cloudy. Her blood eosinophil count elevated to 36.8%eosinophil proportion in PD effluent>90% and PD effluent pathological findings showed eosinophil>90%. Eosinophilic peritonitis was diagnosed and a decision was made to give loratadine daily dose of 10 mg orally. The possible reasons might be the patient's allergy to some components of PD solution or connection systems in the beginning of PD, and this bacterial peritonitis episode, as well as the application of vancomycin, might lead to the fact that eosinophilic peritonitis acutely developed. For there was no improvement in clinical symptoms, loratadine was stopped, and the patient was discharged 18 days later, and received follow-up closely. Two months later, eosinophil count in blood and PD fluid decreased to normal range with no symptom. This case reminds us that in any PD-related peritonitis patient with prolonged symptoms after appropriate antibiotic therapy, and typical clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of eosinophilic peritonitis should be considered. For the count and percentage of eosinophils are not routinely reported in most laboratories, doctors need to contact the department of laboratory and the department of pathology, to confirm the cell count and proportion of eosinophils in dialysis effluent, so as to make the definite diagnosis, which can not only avoid antibiotics overuse, but also avoid antibiotics-induced eosinophilic peritonitis (such as vancomycin)."

We studied markers of microbial translocation (16sDNA), intestinal damage (iFABP), monocyte activation (sCD14), T-cell activation (CD38, HLA-DR) and immune exhaustion (PD1) in 32 HIV-infected children with and 41 HIV-infected children without SAM prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and cross-sectionally compared these children to 15 HIV-uninfected children with and 19 HIV-uninfected children without SAM. We then prospectively measured these markers and correlated them to treatment outcomes in the HIV-infected children at 48 weeks following initiation of ART. Plasma levels of 16sDNA, iFABP and sCD14 were measured by quantitative real time PCR, ELISA and Luminex, respectively. T cell phenotype markers were measured by flow cytometry. Multiple regression analysis was performed using generalized linear models (GLMs) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) approach for variable selection. Microbial translocation, T cell activation and exhaustion were increased in HIV-uninfected children with SAM compared to HIV-uninfected children without SAM. In HIV-infected children microbial translocation, immune activation, and exhaustion was strongly increased but did not differ by SAM-status. SAM was associated with increased mortality rates early after ART initiation. Malnutrition, age, microbial translocation, monocyte, and CD8 T cell activation were independently associated with decreased rates of CD4% immune recovery after 48 weeks of ART. SAM is associated with increased microbial translocation, immune activation, and immune exhaustion in HIV-uninfected children and with worse prognosis and impaired immune recovery in HIV-infected children on ART."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs known to regulate the host immune response against TB. We investigated the expression profile of candidate circulating miRNAs, which could be used as a blood biomarker for the effective diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis. A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted, including 30 children with active-TB and 30 healthy controls (HC) in a tertiary care hospital in Puducherry. We used the SYBR green-based miScript qRT-PCR assay to analyze the expression levels of miRNAs in plasma. Further, we used the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) to evaluate the diagnostic value of miRNAs. Active-TB included 25 (83.3%) pulmonary TB and 5 (16.7%) extrapulmonary TB cases. We found a significant upregulation of miR-21, miR-29a, miR-31, miR-155, and downregulation of miR-146a in children with active-TB compared to HC. The ROC analysis showed an excellent diagnostic value of miRNAs as follows: miR31>miR155>miR146a with AUC of (95% CI) miRNAs 0.978, 0.953, and 0.903, respectively. Altered circulating miRNA expression levels could be involved in the dysregulation of the host immune response to TB.

Quantitative gene expression analysis of various HERV env genes, including HERV-R, HERV-H, HERV-K, and HERV-P was performed by real-time PCR. Results indicate that expression of all four HERV env mRNAs is significantly increased in the blood of lung cancer patients than healthy controls (P-values<0.01). Furthermore, we have observed a positive and significant pairwise correlation between the expressions of four HERV env genes. The level of HERV env transcript in the blood of adenocarcinoma patients was generally much higher than squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Also, the expression of three HERV P, HERV H, and HERV K in the blood of lung cancer patients could significantly differentiate between adenocarcinoma and other types of lung cancer. In conclusion, these four HERV families could be considered as promising non-invasive blood-based biomarkers for prognosis, early detection, and monitoring of lung cancer."

The traditional focus on the patterns of ""reductionism"" which was associated with single molecular changes has been unable to meet the demand of early diagnosis and clinical application when current tuberculosis infection happened. In this study, we employed a systems biology approach to collect large microarray data sets including mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) to identify the differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs in the whole blood of TB patients. The aim was to identify key genes associated with the immune response in the pathogenic process of tuberculosis by analyzing the co-regulatory network that was consisted of transcription factors and miRNAs as well as their target genes. The network along with their co-regulatory genes was analyzed utilizing Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED) and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). We got 21 (19 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes that were co-regulated by transcription factors and miRNAs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the 21 differentially expressed genes were predominantly involved in Tuberculosis signaling pathway, which may play a major role in tuberculosis biological process. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to verify the over expression of co-regulatory genes (FCGR1A and CEBPB). The genetic expression was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics in TB patients and inferences drawn. Our results suggest the TF-miRNA gene co-regulatory network may help us further understand the molecular mechanism of immune response to tuberculosis and provide us a new angle of future biomarker and therapeutic targets."

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study is the evaluation of culture-negative blood samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients with suspected brucellosis were included in this experimental study and given positive serological tests. Diagnosis was performed on patients with clinical symptoms of the disease, followed by the detection of a titer that was equal to or more than 1:160 (in endemic areas) by the standard tube agglutination method. Blood samples were cultured by a BACTEC 9050 system, and subsequently by Brucella agar. At the same time, DNA from all blood samples was extracted by Qiagen Kit Company (Qia Amp Mini Kit). A molecular assay of blood samples was carried out by detection of eryD transcriptase and bcsp 31 genes in specific double PCR reactions. The specificity of the primers was evaluated by DNA from pure and approved Brucella colonies found in the blood samples, by DNA from other bacteria, and by ordinary PCR. DNA extraction from the pure colonies was carried out by both Qiagen Kit and Chelex 100 methods; the two were compared. RESULTS: 39 cases (39%) had positive results when tested by the BACTEC system, and 61 cases (61%) became negative. 23 culture-positive blood samples were randomly selected for PCR reactions; all showed 491 bp for the eryD gene and 223 bp for the bcsp 31 gene. Interestingly, out of 14 culture-negative blood samples, 13 cases showed positive bonds in PCR. The specificity of the PCR method was equal to 100%. DNA extraction from pure cultures was done by both Chelex 100 and Qiagen Kit; these showed the same results for all samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results prove that the presented double PCR method could be used to detect positive cases from culture-negative blood samples. The Chelex 100 method is simpler and safer than the use of Qiagen Kit for DNA extraction."

STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and twelve febrile travelers were studied to rule out a tropical fever [e.g. malaria, dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), West Nile (WNV) and ZIKV]. Molecular tests for detecting ZIKV RNA were applied on serum or urine as well as IgG and IgM specific serology. RESULTS: ZIKV was the most frequent ""tropical infection (11.6%) with 12 infected travelers and one sexual partner of an infected traveler. At the time of the diagnosis, ZIKV RNA was detected in the blood from 9 patients (69%) within 7days from symptom onset; afterwards, the virus was detected only in urine (5 patients) and ZIKV IgM was reactive in 9 patients (69%). Travelers with ZIKV infection tested negative for DENV, CHIKV, WNV and malaria and completely recovered. Other infections identified in travelers were DENV (5 patients, 4.5%), CHIKV (1, 0.9%), malaria (Plasmodium vivax, 1, 0.9%), measles (1, 0.9%) and tuberculosis (1, 0.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The etiologic diagnosis of a febrile illness in travelers where ZIKV is endemic is highly desirable as they are sentinel of a challenging epidemiology including the risk of autochthonous transmission in non endemic countries where the competent or carrier vector is present."

A retrospective parallel detection of IgG T. gondii was performed in serum and CSF in patients, whose results of ELISA or PCR on T. gondii were positive. Blood serum and CSF were obtained from patients at the same time. All samples for analysis were stored at -20 C and then tested on the RT-2100C Rayto Life and Analytical Sciences Co., Ltd (China) immunoassay analyser for quantitative detection of the level of specific anti-Toxicoplasma IgG.

RESULTS: Results: Specific IgG to T. gondii in blood plasma was found in 27 patients (90%) while in CSF only in 7 (23 %). The results of the research in this group of patients were represented by the following parameters: patient 1 (blood antiToxo IgG - 200 IU/ml, blood albumin - 36 g/l, CSF antiToxo IgG - 10 IU/ml, CSF albumin - 0.8 g/l, CNSToxolndex - 2.3); patient 2 (150 / 40 / 90 / 0.7 / 34.3, respectively); patient 3 (90 / 35 / 64 / 0.25 / 99.6); patient 4 (140 / 39/ 10/ 0.19/ 14.7); patient 5 (88 / 52 / 48 / 0.21 / 135.1); patient 6 (160 / 48 / 50 /0.15 / 100.0); patient 7 (122 / 42 / 15 / 0.17 / 30.4). Consequently, taking into consideration the diagnostic marker CNSToxolndex more than 10.0, cerebral toxoplasmosis was diagnosed only in six patients from seven, in whom anti-toxoplasma antibodies in CSF were detected. Patient 1, despite clinical symptoms similar to cerebral toxoplasmosis, and substitute signs of cerebral toxoplasmosis detected with the help of neuroimaging methods (volumetric formation of the right frontal lobe with a ring-shaped enhancement), availability of specific anti-toxoplasma antibodies in blood serum and CSF, diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis has not been confirmed. M. tuberculosis DNA was found in CSF by PCR. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: CNSToxoIndex allows evaluating the local production of anti-toxoplasmic IgG in CNS and their diffusion from blood as a result of the blood-brain barrier damageand it is a powerful method of cerebral toxoplasmosis diagnostics in HIV-positive people as well."

We studied human E-selectin gene polymorphism in 172 asthmatic patients and 173 healthy volunteers by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). To determine the severity of the asthma's situation, a questionnaire was prepared requesting the following information: age, sex, clinical signs and symptoms and past medical history. After the participants filled in the questionnaire, all active or ex-smoker patients were excluded. A trained observer assessed airway reversibility, peak flowmetry and spirometry in asthmatic patients. We found increased serum levels of soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) in asthmatic patients compared with healthy subjects (P<0. 0001). Frequencies of the SS, SR, and RR genotypes were found as 66.3%, 31.4%, and 2.3% in the patients and 91.9%, 8.1%, and 0.0% in control subjects, respectively. The 128Arg allele was more prevalent in patients than controls (OR 5.78; 95% CI, 3.07-10.86, P<0.0001). However, in this study the polymorphism was not associated with circulating sE-selectin levels. We found a direct correlation between the level of sE-selectin and the severity of asthma (P=0.001). On the other hand, there was a close relation between 128Arginine carriage and disease severity (P<0.0001). These results suggest that the Ser128Arg polymorphism of the E-selectin gene is a genetic factor that may be associated with the severity of asthma."

METHODS: DNAs extraction was obtained from blood samples of 50 patients diagnosed with COPD and 50 patients as a control group who were presented to emergency clinic. Genotypes were obtained with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and AIw I and Hsp92II restriction enzymes were used for Q192R and L55M polymorphisms, respectively. Analysis of data was done with the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in Q192R polymorphism was found between the COPD patients and the control group (P=0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in L55M polymorphisms between the patient and control groups (P>0.05). Q192R polymorphism was significantly correlated with the PON1 gene and cigarette smoking; however other risk factors did not show any significant correlation with this polymorphism. Though L55M polymorphism was significantly correlated with family history and tuberculosis, there was no significant correlation with other risk factors. CONCLUSION: We believe that more studies are needed to study the correlation of L55M polymorphism with other factors."

Thus, it is aimed to compare the expression levels of two GCR isoforms (GCR and GCR) in SRA, mild asthmatics, and healthy controls. Total RNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes of 13 SRA patients, 14 mild asthma patients and 30 healthy volunteers. The expression levels of GCR isoforms were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The expression level of GCR isoforms did not show any significant difference between the cases/control groups. However, the relative expression analysis between asthma/control, SRA/control and SRA/asthma groups was in the order of 0.933, 0.768 and 0.823 for GCR and 0.697, 1.014 and 1.454 for GCR, respectively. Also, the expression fold change of GCR/GCR in asthma, SRA and control groups was 786.88, 445.72 and 588.13, respectively. The GCR and GCR isoforms did not show any correlation in SRA; but they had significant correlation in both healthy volunteers (r = 0.490, P = 0.007) and mild asthmatics (r = 0.786, P = 0.001). Also, the GCR expression level had significant inverse correlation with age in SRA (r = -0.709, P = 0.007). Glucocorticoid receptors are related to, but not directly responsible for GC resistance. Since the GCR/GCR expression ratio decreased in SRA, studies are needed to assess its value in diagnosing GC resistance."

Objective: To compare management and outcomes of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposed infants in early infant diagnosis (EID) programmes at MZCH, where DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is performed on site, and CDH, where samples are sent to MZCH, between 2013 and 2014. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Results: Of infants enrolled at MZCH (n = 409) and CDH (n = 176), DNA PCR results were communicated to the children's guardians in respectively 56% and 51% of cases. The median time from sample collection to guardians receiving results was 34 days for MZCH and 56 days for CDH. In both hospitals, only half of the dried blood spot (DBS) samples were collected between 6 and 8 weeks. More guardians from MZCH than CDH received test results within 1 month of sample collection (25% vs. 10%). Among the HIV-positive infants, a higher proportion at MZCH (92%) started antiretroviral therapy than at CDH (46%). The relative risk (RR) of death was higher among infants with late DBS collection (RR 1.3, 95%CI 1.0-1.7) or no collection (RR 5.8, 95%CI 4.6-7.2), and when guardians did not receive test results (RR 8.3, 95%CI 5.7-11.9). Conclusion: EID programmes performed equally poorly at both hospitals, and might be helped by point-of-care DNA PCR testing. Better programme implementation and active follow-up might improve infant outcome and retention in care."

It was decided to undertake treatment as the birds represented a substantial value to the owner. A multiagent therapy using azithromycin, marbofloxacin, and ethambutol was administered. After 4 mo of therapy, the desired results were not obtained. At the end of treatment, the birds were in poor general condition, with white blood cells above 20 g/L, and after clutching, 2-yr-old and older birds were euthanatized. Overall, postmortem lesions were found in 17 out of 49 necropsied individuals. Slide agglutination tests with a M. avium subsp. avium lysate were conducted in all examined pigeons. In 28 pigeons, blood count was conducted once a month during therapy, while in 24 pigeons, a tuberculin sensitivity test was conducted before the planned euthanatization. The tuberculin sensitivity test did not prove useful in the diagnosis of ill individuals. Slide agglutination yielded positive results in only four birds, all of which also had postmortem lesions. Blood count in a large number of cases allowed distinguishing between ill and healthy individuals, which was used for subsequent selection. The comparison of cultured strains with the (CCG)4-based PCR method showed the variation of M. avium isolates up to a maximum of 30%. The described case proves that the treatment of mycobacteriosis in pigeon flocks is not effective, mainly due to the high resistance to M. avium subsp. avium. In addition, therapy may contribute to an even greater increase in mycobacterial resistance to antibiotics, which may pose a potential risk to public health."

Currently, finding exact somatic genomic changes of tumor has gained great importance. On the other hand, crescendoing needs to actual tumor tissue at different time points during cancer treatment may produce major discomfort for NSCLC patients. Tumor genomes can be reconstructed by information obtained from circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) of peripheral blood. cfDNA may be represented as a suitable alternative test for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation detection in these patients. This study aimed to assess validity of cfDNA in somatic EGFR mutation identification in Iranian NSCLC cases. METHODS: Somatic mutation of EGFR gene was studied in both tissue specimens and plasma. Then, mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and sequencing. RESULTS: We observed a high concordance (90%) between tissue samples and cfDNA for EGFR gene mutation. The sensitivity, accuracy, and positive precision value were 90%, 90% and 100%, respectively. A false negative rate of 10% was also demonstrated in this study. CONCLUSION: We established sensitive methods for detecting EGFR gene mutation which may be very useful in clinical practice.<br />."

Recent data indicate that whole blood-based assays to assess the phenotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-specific CD4 T cells hold promise for this purpose and require further investigation in well-characterised TB cohorts. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the phenotypic signature of Mtb-specific CD4 responses, TB disease extent and treatment response. METHODS: Using flow cytometry, we measured the expression of phenotypic and functional markers (HLA-DR, CD27, CD153, KLRG1, IL-2, MIP-1, TNF- and IFN-) on Mtb-specific CD4 T-cells in whole blood from 161 participants of varying TB and HIV status. TB disease extent was graded as a continuum using the Xpert(ct) value, C-reactive protein, Timika radiographic score and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio. RESULTS: The phenotypic profile of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells pre-anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) strongly correlated with disease extent, irrespective of HIV status. ATT associated with major changes in the phenotype of Mtb-specific CD4 T cells, with decreased expression of HLA-DR and increased CD27 and CD153 expression. Principal component analysis showed an almost complete separation between latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB (aTB) pre-ATT groups, whereas the profile of the aTB post-ATT group overlapped with the LTBI group. However, in patients experiencing treatment failure or relapse, no significant changes were observed in Mtb-specific CD4 T-cell phenotype pre- and post-ATT. CONCLUSION: Whole blood-based assays of Mtb-specific CD4 T-cell activation and maturation markers can be used as non-sputum-based biomarkers of disease extent and treatment monitoring in TB, regardless of HIV-1 status."

The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of extended DOTS regimen (2 months of intensive phase and 6 months of continuation phase) as recommended by WHO, by using MRI observations as the healing marker. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 51 (Group A -28 prospective and Group B- 23 retrospective) patients of spine TB with mean age of 26.8 years (range 15-54 years) diagnosed clinico radiologically/imaging (n=36), histopathology or by PCR (n=15) were enrolled for the study. They were treated by extended DOTS regimen (2 months of HRZE and 6 months of HR) administered alternate day. The serial blood investigations and X-rays were done every 2 months. Contrast MRI was done at the end of 8 months and healing changes were recorded. Criteria of healing on the basis of MRI being: complete resolution of pre and paravertebral collections, resolution of marrow edema of vertebral body (VB), replacement of marrow edema by fat or by calcification suggested by iso- intense T1 and T2 weighted images in contrast enhanced MRI. Patients with non healed status, but, responding lesion on MRI after 8 months of treatment were continued on INH and rifampicin alternate day and contrast MRI was done subsequently at 12 months and 18 months till the healed status was achieved . RESULTS: 9 patients had paraplegia and required surgical intervention out of which 1 did not recover neurologically. All patients have completed 8 months of extended DOTS regimen, n=18 achieved healed status and duration of treatment was extended in rest (n=33) 5 were declared healed after 12 months, 8 after 18 months and one after 36 months of treatment, thus 32 were declared healed at varying periods. CONCLUSION: 35.2% patients demonstrate MRI based healed vertebral lesion at the end of 8 months of extended category 1 DOTS regimen. It is unscientific to stop the ATT by fixed time frame and MRI evaluation of the patients is required after 8 months of ATT and subsequently to decide for the continuation stoppage of treatment."

In addition to the huge financial costs that significantly reduce the quality of life of the patients and their families, it causes high prevalence of lung diseases. Finding contributing new genetic factors involved in early diagnosis or progression of asthma can provide novel approaches for treatment or managing of asthma. In the present study, the potential role of two key cytokines of IL-10 and IL-17A was investigated in asthma pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using real-time PCR technique, we analyzed the expression levels of target genes in two groups of mild and severe asthma patient in comparison with healthy individuals. RESULTS: In comparison with control population, obtained data showed 4 and 7-fold down-regulation of IL-17A in the group of mild and severe asthma, respectively. Down-regulation of IL-17A showed a significant correlation with progression of asthma severity. While IL-10 showed up to 10-fold down-regulation in the group of severe asthma, its expression level was not correlated with severity of asthma. CONCLUSION: Obtained data revealed that deregulation IL-10 and IL-17A have potential to play crucial role in pathogenesis and prognosis of asthma. Observed down-regulation of these cytokines in blood cells suggests their usefulness as a marker in diagnosis of asthmatic types in patients."

A previous series of pilot projects in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam suggested that mass drug administration was safe, and when added to provision of early diagnosis and treatment, could reduce the reservoir of P falciparum and interrupts transmission. We examined the effects of a scaled-up programme of this strategy in four townships of eastern Myanmar on the incidence of P falciparum malaria. METHODS: The programme was implemented in the four townships of Myawaddy, Kawkareik, Hlaingbwe, and Hpapun in Kayin state, Myanmar. Increased access to early diagnosis and treatment of malaria was provided to all villages through community-based malaria posts equipped with rapid diagnostic tests, and treatment with artemether-lumefantrine plus single low-dose primaquine. Villages were identified as malarial hotspots (operationally defined as >40% malaria, of which 20% was P falciparum) with surveys using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR either randomly or targeted at villages where the incidence of clinical cases of P falciparum malaria remained high (ie, >100 cases per 1000 individuals per year) despite a functioning malaria post. During each survey, a 2 mL sample of venous blood was obtained from randomly selected adults. Hotspots received targeted mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus single-dose primaquine once per month for 3 consecutive months in addition to the malaria posts. The main outcome was the change in village incidence of clinical P falciparum malaria, quantified using a multivariate, generalised, additive multilevel model. Malaria prevalence was measured in the hotspots 12 months after mass drug administration. FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2014, and April 30, 2017, 1222 malarial posts were opened, providing early diagnosis and treatment to an estimated 365000 individuals. Incidence of P falciparum malaria decreased by 60 to 98% in the four townships. 272 prevalence surveys were undertaken and 69 hotspot villages were identified. By April 2017, 50 hotspots were treated with mass drug administration. Hotspot villages had a three times higher incidence of P falciparum at malarial posts than neighbouring villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 27, 95% CI 18-44). Early diagnosis and treatment was associated with a significant decrease in P falciparum incidence in hotspots (IRR 082, 95% CI 076-088 per quarter) and in other villages (075, 073-078 per quarter). Mass drug administration was associated with a five-times decrease in P falciparum incidence within hotspot villages (IRR 019, 95% CI 013-026). By April, 2017, 965 villages (79%) of 1222 corresponding to 104 village tracts were free from P falciparum malaria for at least 6 months. The prevalence of wild-type genotype for K13 molecular markers of artemisinin resistance was stable over the three years (39%; 249/631). INTERPRETATION: Providing early diagnosis and effective treatment substantially decreased village-level incidence of artemisinin-resistant P falciparum malaria in hard-to-reach, politically sensitive regions of eastern Myanmar. Targeted mass drug administration significantly reduced malaria incidence in hotspots. If these activities could proceed in all contiguous endemic areas in addition to standard control programmes already implemented, there is a possibility of subnational elimination of P falciparum.

Survival of lung cancer patients depends on the timely detection and diagnosis. Among the genetic irregularities that control cancer development and progression, there are microRNAs (miRNAs). This study aimed to assess the plasma level of circulating miRNA-17 and miRNA-222 as non-invasive markers in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Patients and methods: A total of 40 patients with NSCLC and 20 healthy controls who were matched in terms of age and sex with the patient group were included in this case-control study.. Estimation of miRNA-17 and miRNA-222 expression profiles in the plasma was done using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The relationship between both markers and their clinicopathological features were also determined. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was done to evaluate the role of these microRNAs in NSCLC diagnosis and follow-up. Results: MiRNA-17 and miRNA-222 levels were significantly upregulated in NSCLC patients compared with controls (48.3212.35 vs 1.160.19 and 34.533.1 vs 1.220.14) (P=0.000). Plasma miRNA-17 level was increased, and the miRNA-222 level was decreased across different stages of the disease; however, these differences d were not statistically significant (P=0.4, P=0.5, respectively). The miRNA-17 levels were higher in the lung cancer patients with metastasis , but miRNA-222 levels were lower patients without metastasis. We found no statistically significant difference in this regard(P=0.4 vs P=0.3, respectively). ROC curve analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity of miRNA-17 were 77.78% and 87.50% , and of miRNA-222 were 50% and 88.89%. Conclusion: MiRNA-17 and miRNA-222 can be considered as non-invasive biomarkers for detection of early lung carcinogenesis and metastasis in patients with NSCLC, hence providing a basis for the development of novel therapeutic approaches."

Despite multiple courses of antibiotics over the following month she presented again multiple times with progressive symptoms including epistaxis, widespread myalgia and arthralgia, difficulty in breathing, haemoptysis, fatigue, and weight loss. Examination on admission found minimal discharge from her right tympanic membrane, ulcerated inferior turbinates with dried blood and yellow mucus in both nasal cavities, swollen tonsils without exudate, and an isolated aphthous ulcer on the tip of her tongue. She had small bilateral cervical lymph nodes. Examination of the cardiovascular system was unremarkable but on respiratory examination there was reduced air entry on the right side.

Since 2011 policies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) shifted from maternal antiretroviral (ARV) treatment or prophylaxis contingent on CD4 cell count to lifelong maternal ARV treatment (cART). We sought to measure progress with early (4-8 weeks postpartum) MTCT prevention and elimination, 2011-2013, at national and sub-national levels in South Africa, a high antenatal HIV prevalence setting (29%), where early MTCT was 3.5% in 2010. METHODS: Two surveys were conducted (August 2011-March 2012 and October 2012-May 2013), in 580 health facilities, randomly selected after two-stage probability proportional to size sampling of facilities (the primary sampling unit), to provide valid national and sub-national-(provincial)-level estimates. Data collectors interviewed caregivers of eligible infants, reviewed patient-held charts, and collected infant dried blood spots (iDBS). Confirmed positive HIV enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and positive total HIV nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) indicated infant HIV exposure or infection, respectively. Weighted survey analysis was conducted for each survey and for the pooled data. FINDINGS: National data from 10106 and 9120 participants were analyzed (2011-12 and 2012-13 surveys respectively). Infant HIV exposure was 32.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 30.7-33.6%), in 2011-12 and 33.1% (95% CI 31.8-34.4%), provincial range of 22.1-43.6% in 2012-13. MTCT was 2.7% (95% CI 2.1%-3.2%) in 2011-12 and 2.6% (95% CI 2.0-3.2%), provincial range of 1.9-5.4% in 2012-13. HIV-infected ARV-exposed mothers had significantly lower unadjusted early MTCT (2.0% [2011-12: 1.6-2.5%; 2012-13:1.5-2.6%]) compared to HIV-infected ARV-naive mothers [10.2% in 2011-12 (6.5-13.8%); 9.2% in 2012-13 (5.6-12.7%)]. Pooled analyses demonstrated significantly lower early MTCT among exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) mothers receiving >10 weeks ARV prophylaxis or cART compared with EBF and no ARVs: (2.2% [95% CI 1.25-3.09%] vs 12.2% [95% CI 4.7-19.6%], respectively); among HIV-infected ARV-exposed mothers, 24.9% (95% CI 23.5-26.3%) initiated cART during or before the first trimester, and their early MTCT was 1.2% (95% CI 0.6-1.7%). Extrapolating these data, assuming 32% EIA positivity and 2.6% or 1.2% MTCT, 832 and 384 infants per 100000 live births were HIV infected, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although we demonstrate sustained national-level PMTCT impact in a high HIV prevalence setting, results are far-removed from EMTCT targets. Reducing maternal HIV prevalence and treating all maternal HIV infection early are critical for further progress."

Light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy with auramine-phenol staining (LED-AP), recommended for tuberculosis testing, can also detect Cryptosporidium species. A lateral-flow test not requiring refrigerator storage (by contrast with most immunochromatographic lateral-flow assays) has also recently been developed for Cryptosporidium spp detection. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and operational feasibility of LED-AP and the lateral-flow test strip for cryptosporidiosis in children. METHODS: We did a prospective diagnostic accuracy study in two health-care facilities in Ethiopia, in a consecutive series of children younger than 5 years of age with diarrhoea (three or more loose stools within the previous 24 h) or dysentery (at least one loose stool with stains of blood within the previous 24 h). Stool samples were tested for Cryptosporidium spp by LED-AP and the lateral-flow test strip; accuracy of each test was estimated by independent and blind comparison with a composite reference standard comprising quantitative immunofluorescent antibody test (qIFAT), ELISA, and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Quantitative cutoff values for diarrhoea-associated infection were established in an embedded case-control substudy, with cases of cryptosporidiosis coming from the 15 districts in and around Jimma and the eight districts surrounding Serbo, and community controls without diarrhoea in the previous 48 h recruited by weekly frequency matching by geographical district of the household, age group, and enrolment week. FINDINGS: Stool samples from 912 children with diarrhoea or dysentery and 706 controls from the case-control substudy were tested between Dec 22, 2016, and July 6, 2018. Estimated reference-standard cutoff values for cryptosporidiosis positivity were 2310(5) DNA copies per g of wet stool for qPCR, and 725 oocysts per g for qIFAT. LED-AP had a sensitivity for cryptosporidiosis of 88% (95% CI 79-94; 66 of 75 samples) and a specificity of 99% (98-99; 717 of 726 samples); the lateral-flow test strip had a sensitivity of 89% (79-94; 63 of 71 samples) and a specificity of 99% (97-99; 626 of 635 samples). INTERPRETATION: LED-AP has high sensitivity and specificity for cryptosporidiosis and should be considered as a dual-use technology that can be easily integrated with existing laboratory infrastructures in low-resource settings. The lateral-flow test strip has similar sensitivity and specificity and provides an alternative that does not require microscopy, although purchase cost of the test strip is unknown as it is not yet available on the market.

Studies have shown cell-free microRNAs (miRNAs) circulating in the serum and plasma with specific expression in cancer, indicating the potential of using miRNAs as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and therapy. This study aimed to identify differentially-expressed two miRNAs in the plasma of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients that might be a clinically useful tool for lung cancer early detection. miRNA-21 is one of the most abundant oncomirs. miRNA-23a functions as an oncogene in several human cancers, however, its clinical value has not been investigated in NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in Assiut University Hospital, Egypt, from 2017 to 2018. Plasma samples were obtained from 45 NSCLC patients. The expression level of miR-21 and miRNA-23a was detected by qRT-PCR and compared to 40 healthy control subjects. The relation between both miRNAs and clinicopathological parameters was evaluated. RESULTS: The expression level of miR-21 and miRNA-23a was significantly up-regulated (36.9  18.7 vs. 1.12  0.84 and 24.7  19.09 vs. 1.16  0.45) in NSCLC compared to matched controls (P<0.0001each). There was a significant difference in the level of plasma miRNA-21 and miRNA- 23a expression between the different grades of the disease (P = 0.032 and P = 0.001, respectively). The plasma miRNA-21 and miRNA-23a levels in the lung cancer patients with distant metastasis (n = 20) were significantly higher than those in the patients without metastasis (n = 25) (P<0.0001 each), the expression of miR-21 and miRNA-23a was significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.001, P = 0.0001, respectively), but not significantly related to lymph node metastasis (P = 0.687 and 0.696, respectively). A positive correlation was observed between miRNA-21 and miRNA-23a (r = 0.784, P<0.01), There was no significant difference in the plasma miRNA-21 and miRNA-23a levels in the lung cancer patients with different histopathological types. CONCLUSION: miR-21 and miR-23a might play an oncogenic role in LC and is a poor prognostic factor. Switching off miRNA-21 and miRNA-23a may improve the treatment of LC. Our results must be verified by large-scale prospective studies with standardized methodology."

Overall, 79 progressors who developed TB between 3 and 24 months after diagnosis of index case and 328 matched nonprogressors who remained healthy during 24 months of follow-up were investigated.Measurements and Main Results: A four-transcript signature derived from samples in a South African and Gambian training set predicted progression up to two years before onset of disease in blinded test set samples from South Africa, the Gambia, and Ethiopia with little population-associated variability, and it was also validated in an external cohort of South African adolescents with latent M. tuberculosis infection. By contrast, published diagnostic or prognostic TB signatures were predicted in samples from some but not all three countries, indicating site-specific variability. Post hoc meta-analysis identified a single gene pair, C1QC/TRAV27 (complement C1q C-chain / T-cell receptor- variable gene 27) that would consistently predict TB progression in household contacts from multiple African sites but not in infected adolescents without known recent exposure events.Conclusions: Collectively, we developed a simple whole blood-based PCR test to predict TB in recently exposed household contacts from diverse African populations. This test has potential for implementation in national TB contact investigation programs."

The CF clinical phenotype shows wide variation ranging from severe disease in early childhood in those homozygous for the p.Phe508del mutation to absence of the vas deferens in otherwise healthy men homozygous for the p.Arg117His mutation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from whole blood from 62 patients with CF. The CFTR mutation was determined by Allele-Specific PCR assay. The spearman and linear regression analysis were used to obtain the correlation between phenotype and genotype relationship. RESULTS: Out of total 62 patients, 35 (56.4%) were male. The mean age of the patients was 15.56  6.65 years. Mutations in CFTR were detected in 64.5% of the patients. The commonest mutations were p.Phe508del (33.9%), p.Arg117His; [5T] (5.64%), p.Arg117His; [7T] (4.03%) and p.Trp1282X (5.64%). Mutations p.Ile507del (4%), p.Gly542X (4%), p.Asn1303Lys (2.42%), c.489+1G>T (1.6%), p.Gly551Asp (1.6%) and c.1585-1G>A (1.6%) were also detected. Most mutations were detected in west and south of Iran, while p.Phe508del mutation was dominant mutation (75%) in east and southeast of Iran. The study showed either an association between this mutation with severity of disease and sex or an association between p.Arg117His mutations and age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The geographic distribution of gene mutation in Iranian cystic fibrosis patients was very heterogenic. In spite of the study that showed a correlation between p.Phe508del and severity of disease, to find any correlation between genotype and phenotype a broad and multi-centered study is recommended."

MicroRNAs, as new biomarkers, are recommended for diagnosis and treatment of different types of cancers. Bevacizumab, sold under the trade name Avastin, is a humanized whole monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor A; angiogenesis) and oncogenic signaling pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study comprised 50 cases suffering from OSCC and 50 healthy participants. Peripheral blood samples were collected in glass test tubes, and RNA extraction was started immediately. Expression levels of miR-155, miR-191, and miR-494 biomarkers in the peripheral blood of OSCC-affected individuals and healthy volunteers in vivo were evaluated using real-time PCR. The influence of Avastin on the expression levels of the aforementioned biomarkers in vitro and in the HN5 cell line was also investigated. RESULTS: Expression levels of miR-155, miR-191, and miR-494 in the peripheral blood of individuals affected by OSCC were higher than in those who were healthy. Moreover, Avastin at a concentration of 400 M caused a decrease in the expression levels of the three biomarkers and a 1.5-fold, 3.5-fold, and 4-fold increase in apoptosis in the test samples compared to the controls in the HN5 cell line after 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study demonstrate that overexpression of miR-155, miR-191, and miR-494 is associated with OSCC, and Avastin is able to regulate and downregulate the expression of those biomarkers and increase apoptosis in cancerous cells in the HN5 cell line."

Aims: Differential diagnosis of paratuberculosis and TB in blood samples of cattle and buffaloes. Methods: In this study, an in-house developed multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting MAP, Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium smegmatis was used in blood samples (buffy coat) parallel with IS900 PCR and esxB PCR for diagnosis of paratuberculosis and TB, respectively; in a total of 202 cattle and buffaloes. Results: Out of 202 animals, 12 (5.9%) and 17 (8.4%) animals were positive for MAP by multiplex PCR and IS900 PCR, respectively; from which only 8 (4%) animals were positive by both tests; whereas 4 and 9 animals were exclusively positive by multiplex PCR and IS900 PCR, respectively. None of the animals were found to be positive for M. bovis and M. smegmatis by the multiplex PCR. However, the esxB PCR detected 13 (6.4%) animals positive for TB. In fact, 3 (1.5%) animals were found to be co-infected by both paratuberculosis and TB. Conclusion: The in-house multiplex PCR detected MAP in buffy coat and there was a fair degree of agreement between the multiplex PCR and IS900 PCR in detection of MAP DNA though the latter detected more number of animals to be positive for MAP. Besides, esxB PCR showed a high diagnostic potential and can be used for diagnosis of TB from blood.  2020 Shiraz University. All rights reserved."

Early diagnosis is always important in order to avoid spreading. At present, many studies have confirmed that microRNA (miRNA) could be a useful tool for diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate whether miRNAs could be regarded as a noninvasive diagnosis biomarker from sputum for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Materials and Methods: The M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv was incubated and cultured with human macrophage line THP-1. The total RNA was extracted from the THP-1 cells for detection. Six increased expressions of miRNAs were selected by miRNA microarray chips and the miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR in the M. tuberculosis infection cell model. At last, the efficiency of other methods was compared with using miRNA. Results:OnlymiR-155showedabetterdiagnosticvalueforPTBthantheotherfivemiRNAstodistinguish PTB from non-PTB, including pneumonia, lung cancer, and unexplained pulmonary nodules. Next, we detected and analyzed the results of 68 PTB patients and 122 non-PTB, the sensitivity and specificity of miR-155 detection was 94.1% and 87.7%, respectively. It was higher than sputum smear detection and anti-TB antibody detection. But slightly lower than ELISpot (97%, P=0.404). Interestingly, the ranking of sputum smear by Ziehl-Neelsen staining had positive correlation with the expression level of miR-155 in smear-positive sputum (R2=0.8443, P&lt;0.05).

CNS infections in HIV-infected patients are often challenging to diagnose by traditional microbiological testing, impacting treatment and outcome. Recent Findings: Recent advances in diagnostic techniques, including metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), are changing the landscape of microbiological testing, mainly in resource-rich settings. Pathogen discovery techniques offer a hypothesis-free approach to diagnostic testing, yielding comprehensive analysis of microbial genetic material. Given the extent of genetic material produced, deep sequencing tools not only hold promise in the diagnosis of CNS infections but also in defining key pathogenic steps which have previously been unanswered. Summary: Significant challenges remain to implementing pathogen discovery techniques in routine clinical practice including cost, expertise and infrastructure needed including laboratory and bioinformatics support, and sample contamination risk. The use in resource-limited regions where the burden of CNS complications due to HIV/AIDS is highest remains poorly defined. Though, major opportunities utilizing pathogen discovery techniques exist to enhance surveillance and diagnosis and improve our understanding of mechanisms of neuroinvasion in CNS conditions associated with HIV.  2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

TNF- and VEGF were closely correlated with patient age, low-grade fever, expectoration, hemoptysis and pulmonary tuberculosis classification (P<0.050). Conclusion: Highly expressed in pulmonary tuberculosis patients, TNF- and VEGF are closely correlated with the disease progression of patients, expected to become targets for the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in the future.  2020, Iranian Journal of Public Health.

It is endemic to almost all Latin American countries, including the southern United States. The acute form of ChD and its actual incidence have rarely been described in Mexico, despite the extensive presence of favorable niches for its transmission. The objective of this study was to estimate the frequency of acute ChD in febrile patients at the central Pacific coast of Mexico. For this, we surveyed patients with persistent fever (5 to 10 days) in five hospitals at the Mexican states of Jalisco, Colima, and Nayarit in 2012. Samples were taken from a total of 485 patients to detect Tc in blood using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and direct microscopic examination. Of these subjects, 10 were positive for PCR and none for microscopic examination (2% in 12 months). We adjusted this rate by the total people at risk in the area and obtained an incidence of 7.4/100,000 habs./year. The positive cases showed no association with sex, rural settlement, or pet ownership, only with the contact with Triatominae insects (odds ratio = 9.22 and confidence interval: 1.93-44.06). The clinical picture of positive patients showed an association with the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections. Meanwhile, only one fatal case showed the typical picture of acute fatal cardiomyopathy. The pulmonary manifestations of our patients suggest possible lung pathogenicity of Tc, which merits further investigation. Our findings differ markedly from the official reports for ChD. This difference suggests an underestimation of the disease. These findings urge the Mexican health authorities to implement more vigorous actions aimed at improving medical skills in the timely diagnosis of ChD, as well as to apply efficient preventive programs.

Simple host biomarkers that correlate with response to drug treatment would facilitate improvement in outcomes and the evaluation of novel therapies. In a prospective longitudinal cohort study, we evaluated neutrophil count and phenotype at baseline, as well as during TB treatment in 79 patients [50 (63%) HIV-positive] with microbiologically confirmed drug susceptible TB undergoing standard treatment. At time of diagnosis, blood neutrophils were highly expanded and surface expression of the neutrophil marker CD15 greatly reduced compared to controls. Both measures changed rapidly with the commencement of drug treatment and returned to levels seen in healthy control by treatment completion. Additionally, at the time of diagnosis, high neutrophil count, and low CD15 expression was associated with higher sputum bacterial load and more severe lung damage on chest x-ray, two clinically relevant markers of disease severity. Furthermore, CD15 expression level at diagnosis was associated with TB culture conversion after 2 months of therapy (OR: 0.14, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.89), a standard measure of early TB treatment success. Importantly, our data was not significantly impacted by HIV co-infection. These data suggest that blood neutrophil metrics could potentially be exploited to develop a simple and rapid test to help determine TB disease severity, monitor drug treatment response, and identify subjects at diagnosis who may respond poorly to treatment.

In this paper, a case of sporadic herpes encephalitis in a pregnant woman at 26 weeks of gestation was reported. Case presentation: The patient was a 30-year-old pregnant woman with gestational age of 26 weeks that due to decreased consciousness, confusion, failure to answer questions, disorientation, nausea and vomiting, headache on both sides of the temporal region and Dysphoria was admitted in gynecology ward of Bojnourd Bentolhoda Hospital. On admission, vital signs and oxygen saturation were normal. Magnesium sulfate was administered because of suspected neurological symptoms of eclampsia and proteinuria. Brain MRI was performed after 8 hours due to fever, continued disturbance of consciousness and generalized tonic-clonic seizure that bilateral involvement of the temporal and left frontal areas was evident. Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed Sharps waves in the left frontal, which was consistent with seizure disorder. Intravenous acyclovir was administered after convulsions and exacerbation of neurological symptoms. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Herpes simplex virus 1 and Brucella in Cerebrospinal Fluid was negative. Level of Protein, leukocytes and RBC was increased in CSF analysis. Blood cultures and serum tests for brucellosis (2-mercaptomethanol and Wright's agglutination test) were negative. PCR was not repeated because of the patient's dissatisfaction. According to the results of laboratory tests, brain MRI and EEG, diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis was suggested. The patient improved and was discharged after 14 days of hospitalization. Healthy baby was born by vaginal delivery at 39 weeks of gestation. Conclusion: In the event of neurological symptoms in pregnant women (headache, dizziness, and altered consciousness), an urgent consultation with a neurologist is required to rule out other differential life-threatening diagnoses other than eclampsia such as herpes simplex encephalitis. Since there is no specific guideline for management of viral encephalitis in pregnancy, guidelines designed for non-pregnant women are recommended in these cases.  2020, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

The clinical and radiological presentation of these potentially fatal conditions can be easily confused and there is a potential for misdiagnosis. Case Report: We present a 58-year-old Hispanic female who was admitted to the hospital with dizziness and fever. Her initial admission diagnosis was severe sepsis secondary to community acquired pneumonia. She was started on intravenous antibiotics. Due to mediastinal lymphadenopathy, lymphoma was considered as a differential diagnosis for which she underwent bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound-guided sampling of her mediastinal lymph nodes. Lymph node aspirate was suggestive of lymphoma. Initial cultures were negative. Her clinical course was complicated with respiratory failure, cytopenia, and rapidly progressive cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent cervical lymph node excision and bone marrow biopsy. The pathology of the lymph nodes confirmed T cell lymphoma, and bone marrow revealed hemophagocytosis. The patient was started on chemotherapy but she continued to deteriorate and died on day 20 of her hospital admission. Post-mortem results of cultures from a cervical lymph node biopsy and PCR were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Conclusions: We suggest an aggressive tissue diagnosis with staining for acid-fast bacilli for early diagnosis in patients presenting with hemophagocytic syndrome secondary to lymphoma as coexisting tuberculosis is a consideration. Tuberculosis re-activation should be considered in patients from an endemic region who present with lymphoma and a deteriorating clinical condition.  Am J Case Rep, 2017."

There is an increase in the prevalence of MDR-TB worldwide both among new tuberculosis cases as well as previously-treated ones. There is also a rise in transmission of resistant strains due to an increase in MDR-TB patients largely due to the poor drug compliance and the impact of Human immunodeficiency virus infection. Therefore, we in-tend to determine the extent of MDR-TB among attendees of chest clinics in Osun-State, Nigeria. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of MDR-TB among confirmed tuberculosis patients attending chest clinics in Osun-State, Nigeria. Methods: This study was conducted among 207 attendees of chest clinics in Osun-State between June, 2015 and October 15, 2016. Sputum and blood samples of the participants were collected. GeneXpert test was carried out first on the samples for simultaneous identification of MTB and rifampicin re-sistance. Sputum samples were cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen (L-J) medium using N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH) decontamination method. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) to three first-line drugs was carried out using the proportion DST method. Results: The prevalence of MTB was found to be 27.5% while the prevalence of MDR-TB from the fifty-seven isolates was 10.5%. Previously treated and new cases had a prevalence of 7.0% and 3.5% MDR-TB, respectively. Seventy (33.8%) participants were positive for HIV infection, out of which twenty-six (12.6%) had co-infection of tuberculosis and HIV. The mono-resistance rates of the three first-line drugs used were: 5.3% and 8.7% for ethambutol (EMB) and isoniazid (INH), respectively. No isolate had mono-resistance (0%) to rifampicin (RIF). Conclusion: This study observed the prevalence of 27.5% MTB and a prevalence of 10.5% MDR-TB among the MTB isolates. The prevalence of TB is high in Osun State. MDR-TB prevalence is higher compared with the national estimate of MDR-TB (5.1%) of 2017. Resistant TB is a threat to national tuberculosis control and it is recommended that all the facilities be equipped to cater to its diagnosis.  2020 Bentham Science Publishers."

RESULTS: Results: Specific IgG to T. gondii in blood plasma was found in 27 patients (90%) while in CSF only in 7 (23 %). The results of the research in this group of patients were represented by the following parameters: patient 1 (blood antiToxo IgG - 200 IU/ml, blood albumin - 36 g/l, CSF antiToxo IgG - 10 IU/ml, CSF albumin - 0.8 g/l, CNSToxolndex - 2.3); patient 2 (150 / 40 / 90 / 0.7 / 34.3, respectively); patient 3 (90 / 35 / 64 / 0.25 / 99.6); patient 4 (140 / 39/ 10/ 0.19/ 14.7); patient 5 (88 / 52 / 48 / 0.21 / 135.1); patient 6 (160 / 48 / 50 /0.15 / 100.0); patient 7 (122 / 42 / 15 / 0.17 / 30.4). Consequently, taking into consideration the diagnostic marker CNSToxolndex more than 10.0, cerebral toxoplasmosis was diagnosed only in six patients from seven, in whom anti-toxoplasma antibodies in CSF were detected. Patient 1, despite clinical symptoms similar to cerebral toxoplasmosis, and substitute signs of cerebral toxoplasmosis detected with the help of neuroimaging methods (volumetric formation of the right frontal lobe with a ring-shaped enhancement), availability of specific anti-toxoplasma antibodies in blood serum and CSF, diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis has not been confirmed. M. tuberculosis DNA was found in CSF by PCR. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: CNSToxoIndex allows evaluating the local production of anti-toxoplasmic IgG in CNS and their diffusion from blood as a result of the blood-brain barrier damageand it is a powerful method of cerebral toxoplasmosis diagnostics in HIV-positive people as well."

Among 10 million patients that fell ill with tuberculosis in the year 2017, 36 % were undiagnosed or detected and not reported; the number goes as high as 55 % in Tanzania, showing that the diagnosis of TB is a big challenge in the developing countries. There have been great advancements in TB diagnostics with introduction of the molecular tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, lipoarabinomannan urine strip test, and molecular line-probe assays. However, most of the hospitals in Tanzania still rely on the TB score chart in children, the WHO screening questions in adults, acid-fast bacilli and chest x-ray for the diagnosis of TB. Xpert MTB/RIF has been rolled-out but remains a challenge in settings where the samples for testing must be transported over many kilometers. Imaging by sonography - nowadays widely available even in rural settings of Tanzania - has been shown to be a useful tool in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Despite all the efforts and new diagnostics, 30-50 % of patients in high-burden TB countries are still empirically treated for tuberculosis. More efforts need to be placed if we are to reduce the death toll by 90 % until 2030.  2019 Hogrefe."

There is no effective rapid diagnostic test for use in children. We aimed to develop a clinical decision tool to facilitate the early diagnosis of childhood TBM. Methods: Retrospective case-control study was performed across 7 hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (2010-2014). We identified the variables most predictive of microbiologically confirmed TBM in children (3 months to 15 years) by univariate analysis. These variables were modelled into a clinical decision tool and performance tested on an independent sample group. Results: Of 865 children with suspected TBM, 3% (25) were identified with microbiologically confirmed TBM. Clinical information was retrieved for 22 microbiologically confirmed cases of TBM and compared with 66 controls matched for age, ethnicity, sex and geographical origin. The 9 most predictive variables among the confirmed cases were used to develop a clinical decision tool (CHILD TB LP): Altered Consciousness; caregiver HIV infected; Illness length &gt;7 days; Lethargy; focal neurologic Deficit; failure to Thrive; Blood/serum sodium &lt;132 mmol/L; CSF &gt;10 Lymphocytes 106/L; CSF Protein &gt;0.65 g/L. This tool successfully classified an independent sample of 7 cases and 21 controls with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90%. Conclusions: The CHILD TB LP decision tool accurately classified microbiologically confirmed TBM. We propose that CHILD TB LP is prospectively evaluated as a novel rapid diagnostic tool for use in the initial evaluation of children with suspected neurologic infection presenting to hospitals in similar settings.  2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Serology examinations were negative for HIV, HBsAg, anti HCV and blood culture had no growth. Urinary examination revealed severe leucocyturia, hematuria, and negative for bacteria, nitrite and cast. Urine culture was positive for Candida glabrata. Pulmonary X-ray suggested right pleural fibrotic. He was initially diagnosed as multiple myeloma with fungal infection. Nevertheless, additional peripheral blood smear showed neither rouleaux formation nor blast. He underwent percutaneous nephrostomy and got micafungin intravenously. Instead of improving, the patient deteriorated and transferred to intensive room. We then explored the possibility of TB infection. Further examination revealed positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in urinary polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Tracheal sputum examination was positive for acid fast bacilli staining.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recognized 6.3 million new TB cases in 2017, 16% corresponding to extrapulmonary forms; pleural tuberculosis (PT) is the most common extrapulmonary form in adults. PT diagnosis is often challenging because the scarcity of bacilli in pleural fluid (PF), sometimes requiring invasive procedures to obtain pleural tissue for histological, microbiological or molecular examination. In regions of medium and high disease prevalence, adenosine deaminase (ADA), interferon gamma (IFN-) and interleukin 27 (IL-27) dosages are useful to establish presumptive diagnosis in patients with compatible clinical/radiological picture who present with lymphocytic pleural effusion. PT treatment is similar to the pulmonary TB treatment regimen recommended by WHO. Area covered: In this update, we present a PT review, including epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and therapy. Expert opinion: There is no PF test alone accurate for PT diagnosis, despite the evolution in clinical laboratory. ADA, IFN- and IL-27 are valuable laboratory biomarkers; however, IFN- and IL-27 are quite expensive. Molecular tests present low sensitivity in PF, being useful for diagnostic confirmation. Multidrug therapy remains the PT treatment choice. Advancing research in immunotherapy may bring benefits to PT patients.  2019,  2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

Many cases still remain undiagnosed, and rapid and effective screening strategies are needed to control the TB epidemics. Immunological biomarkers may contribute. Methods: Plasma samples from healthy individuals (n: 12) and from HIV-infected individuals with (n: 21) and without pulmonary TB (n: 122) were tested for C-reactive protein (CRP), neopterin, and interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10). Increased levels of biomarkers and WHO 4-symptom-screening were compared with the presence of pulmonary TB. Survival status at 12 months was recorded. Associations with CD4 count, BMI, haemoglobin, disease severity, and mortality were analysed. Results: The plasma levels of the biomarkers were significantly higher in TB-positive (n:21) compared to TB-negative (n:122) subjects. WHO symptoms, increased neopterin (>10 nmol/L) and CRP (>10 mg/L) showed similar sensitivity and different specificity, with increased CRP showing higher and increased neopterin lower specificity. The three markers were inversely correlated to haemoglobin and to CD4, and CRP levels inversely correlated to BMI. The markers were also significantly higher in individuals with subsequent mortality and in individuals with higher mycobacterial load in sputum according to Xpert results (IP-10 and CRP). Conclusion: This study showed significant associations of the biomarkers analysed with TB infection and mortality, that could have potential clinical relevance. Biomarker levels may be included in operational research on TB screening and diagnosis.  2019"

Among them tubercular involvement of the lumbosacral region or isolated involvement of sacram is very rare presentation. Aim of the work: The aim of this case presentation is to describe two rare cases of Potts disease which clinically mimicked spinal tumor. Case report: A 60-year-old hypertensive, diabetic male patient admitted with low back pain radiating to both lower limbs for 7 months along with low grade fever, generalized weakness and weight loss for the same duration. Clinically, patient had features of flaccid paraparesis, tenderness at the lumbosacral junction, restricted SLR on both sides. There was no features of autonomic dysfunction. MRI of lumbosacral spine showed infective spondylodiscitis at L4 to S1 level with collapse of L5 vertebrae along with paravertebral and epidural abscess. Diagnosis was confirmed by CT guided FNAC from the lesion. Next case was a 23-year-old male patient presented with back pain and walking difficulty for 5 months with some constitutional symptoms.MRI of the dorsal spine with whole spine screening showed multifocal skipped lesion involving whole spine with presence of huge pre-sacral collection. Percutaneous transpedicular aspiration of the purulent material under C-Arm guidance was done and tuberculous infection confirmed by Gene Xpert.

Characteristic tubercle development was observed in 26 animals macroscopic examination yet 27 and 20 cases were found compatible with tuberculosis in HE and ZN respectively. Tuberculosis positive results were also obtained from lungs, mediastinal lymph nodes and liver via immunohistochemistry (IHC), PCR tissue , immunocytochemistry of the buffy coat (ICC bc) and PCR of the buffy coat (PCR bc ) in 26, 18, 3 and 14 cows respectively. The agents were observed extracytoplasmically and intracytoplasmically in macrophages, giant cells, lymphocytes and fibrocytes in IHC. ICC bc positivity was observed within the cytoplasm of mononuclear leukocytes. Furthermore, the agent was not always detected via ZN staining, which verifies the necessity of ancillary tests. Among these methods IHC has revealed significant sensitivity compared to those of PCR bc and ICC bc (Mc nemar; p&lt;0.05 ve 0.01 respectively), and exhibited compatibility with HE and ZN (Cohen kappa; p&lt;0.001 and 0.05 respectively). These results confirm the fact that rather than one single golden technique, combination of various techniques is necessary for accurate and rapid diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. It has also been concluded that further investigation is necessary to clarify the efficient routine usage of molecular techniques (PCR tissue/bc ) in place of other diagnostic techniques.  2019, Chartered Inst. of Building Services Engineers.

A rapid diagnosis and prompt treatment are associated with a favourable outcome. In recent years nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed to speed detection and identification of pathogens directly from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of a commercially available multiplex PCR assay for etiological diagnosis of infectious meningitis directly from CSF samples to that obtained after CSF cultures. A secondary endpoint was to look for a possible screening threshold based on main CSF indices and urgent blood tests results, to define CSF samples with low pre-test probability of PCR and/or culture positive result. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of results of CSF samples already processed as part of routine clinical care in the period February 2016 through December 2018. Results: 109 CSF samples were included in the study and a total of 14 bacteria were identified by either PCR, culture or both methods, along with nine samples positive for viruses. After exclusion of the isolates not detectable by the multiplex PCR panel, the diagnostic accuracy was: 100% (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.1% to 100%) sensitivity; 98.9% (95% CI: 93.5% to 99.9%) specificity; 85.7% (95% CI: 42% to 99.2%) positive predictive value; 100% (95% CI: 95.1% to 100%) negative predictive value; 96 (95% CI: 13.6 to 674.6) positive likelihood ratio; Zero negative likelihood ratio; Cohens kappa: 0.918, p<0.0001. CSF proteins value  28 mg/dl and CSF glucose/blood glucose ratio  0.78 were associated with both PCR negative result for bacteria or viruses and culture negative result. Conclusions: Even if on a limited sample of patients, the multiplex PCR evaluated in this study showed a very good diagnostic performance compared to culture and the thresholds found can be a useful tool to better choose which samples should be tested.  2019, EDIMES Edizioni Medico Scientifiche.

This study was conducted to delineate the epidemiological and microbiological status of vertebral osteomyelitis in Hamadan, Iran. Materials & Methods: In this retrospective study, all patients with definite diagnosis of spondylodiscitis (changing of intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebral MRI signal) hospitalized in Besat and Farshchian Hospitals of Hamadan between 2006 and 2015 (during 10 years) were enrolled by convenience sampling. Data on age, gender, underlying disease, constitutional symptoms, place of acquiring infection, leukocytosis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), surgical intervention, vertebral biopsy culture, anemia, abscess, place of vertebral involvement, positive brucellosis test, and blood culture results were obtained from the patients medical files and recorded in a questionnaire. Results: A total of 71 patients with spondylodiscitis (mean age: 49.56 years) were enrolled. Brucella (n: 27, 38%) was the leading cause of the disease followed by tuberculosis (n: 11, 15.5%). Although 34 patients had positive serologic test for Brucella, other agents were causes of the disease according to course of treatment and vertebral biopsy in 7 of them. In 21 cases, the cause of the disease was unknown. The most common place of involvement was lumbosacral region (78.9%). Conclusion: Unlike Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline that do not recommend to perform age-guided aspiration biopsy in suspected cases of spondylodiscitis when Brucella is endemic and whereby people have strong positive serology, our results demonstrated that, even in case of positive Brucella test, other factors are likely to contribute to acquiring spondylodiscitis, and vertebral biopsy is recommended for definite diagnosis. Early diagnosis is necessary to select appropriate antibiotic and treat spondylodiscitis early.  2019, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services. All rights reserved."

Although locally extinct due to habitat degradation, human poaching and reduction of tropical forests in recent decades, some remnant populations are known to be small and isolated. Thus, information on its ecology, including infectious diseases, is critical for conservation efforts and management of populations of this emblematic species in the wild. Avian Mycobacteriosis (AM) is a chronic disease affecting a wide range of birds and mammals and clinical cases have been sporadically reported, although in harpy eagles, has not been documented. In addition, scant information exists on pathologies affecting raptors, therefore, this report expands the knowledge on infectious diseases affecting wild birds. This study describes the first case of AM in an immature harpy eagle rescued from Darien gap and presents details of the clinical manifestation of the disease and its histological findings. Case: An immature harpy eagle was presented to a rescue center after being confiscated by Ministry of Environment from a local farm in a remote region of Eastern Panama, in the Darien gap. The raptor had a history of having been kept in captivity for approximately five weeks, cohabiting with backyard poultry and fed corn, raw duck and chicken provided by farm owners. Stagnant water was offered for drinking. The harpy eagle arrived to the facility very lethargic and emaciated. Physical examination revealed damaged plumage, poor body condition and dyspnea. Complete blood count revealed anemia and leukocytosis based on lymphocytosis and eosinophilia. Biochemical profile evidenced an increased level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), phosphorus and total plasma protein. Most remarkable radiographic findings were splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and increased opacity in kidneys, intestines, and aerial sacs. None of the other diagnostic tests performed were conclusive, like tracheal, esophageal and cloacal cultures for fungal infection and fecal exam. After one week of treatment, it showed a remarkable recovery, but at the end of the second week, declined dramatically, dying in the third week of treatment. Post-mortem examination revealed the presence of diffuse granulomas in multiple organs. Histologic examination with gram and Ziehl Neelsen staining revealed the presence of gram-positive and acid-fast bacteria, compatible with Mycobacterium-like bacilli. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the hsp65, digested with BstEII and HaEIII restriction enzymes confirmed the presence Mycobacterium avium complex in tissues samples. Discussion: This is the first report of AM in a harpy eagle, presenting an extreme emaciation with dyspnea, abnormalities in spleen, liver and air sacs. Biochemical and hematological parameters revealed alterations consistent with infection and organ malfunctions in liver, but Mycobacteriosis was not suspected initially and it was necessary to support the diagnosis with histopathological studies and DNA amplification for a proper identification of the disease. This allowed us to confirm that ante-mortem clinical diagnosis of Avian Mycobacteriosis can be challenging, especially in birds who usually show non-specific signs of the disease and external lesions are not commonly observed. Further studies are requiring to determine the characteristics and clinical signs of this disease in this and other raptors. Also, to determine the source of infection affecting raptors and other protected species in the Neotropical region, especially for diseases with relevance in the conservation of birds and animal health control.  2019 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

Scrofuloderma is an endogenous form of cutaneous tuberculosis and can present as isolated or coexist with pulmonary and disseminated forms of tuberculosis. Pathologically confirmed scrofuloderma coexisting with disseminated tuberculosis with a good treatment response is presented and discussed. Case presentation: A 12-year-old African Ethiopian girl presented with bilateral neck swelling with purulent discharge and skin ulceration of 3 months' duration. Dry cough, low-grade fever, decreased appetite, drenching night sweats, global throbbing headache, and a significant amount of weight loss were also reported. Biopsy of the skin identified scrofuloderma, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also identified by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and brain computed tomographic scans showed tuberculous meningitis and tuberculoma. Antituberculosis therapy with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol; prednisolone; pyridoxine; and wound care were provided. The patient was discharged for outpatient directly observed antituberculosis therapy in a nearby health center after acute complications were treated and once the skin lesion had started to dry or heal. Conclusions: Cutaneous tuberculosis should be considered in a child presenting with a skin lesion or discharge. Cutaneous tuberculosis cases should be investigated for coexisting pulmonary and extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis. Histopathologic diagnosis should be considered to rule out other skin pathologies and also to prevent delay in treatment. Better tuberculosis prevention strategies, including vaccination scale-up, are warranted.  2018 The Author(s)."

Eosinophilic peritonitis is a rare type of non-infection PD-related peritonitis. Eosinophilic peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients was first reported in 1967. The cause of eosinophilic peritonitis is obscure, however it may be related to some etiologies: (1) hypersensitivity to PD materials, including catheter or dialysate; (2) bacteria, fungal or mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Clinical investigations include asymptomatic cloudy PD effluent, fever, abdominal pain and eosinophil count elevate in PD effluent. Eosinophilic peritonitis is usually mild and self-limited. With the development of PD, more eosinophilic peritonitis cases and researches were reported. Here, we report a patient on CAPD with eosinophilic peritonitis. A 71-year-old female patient developed end-stage renal disease for 4 years and underwent CAPD (2 000 mL of 1.5% dialysis solution with four exchanges daily) for 5 months. With a history of unclean food, she was hospitalized for complaints of diarrhea, fever and cloudy peritoneal effluent for 10 days. Dialysis effluent showed an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count of 1 980 cell/mm3, with 60% polymorphonuclear cells. She was diagnosed as PD-related peritonitis, and therapy was initiated with intraperitoneal ceftazidime 1 g once a day and vancomycin 500 mg every other day. She was admitted to the hospital as the symptoms were not relieved. Her peripheral blood cell count showed a total WBC count of 6 940 cells/mm3, 36.8% eosinophil. Her PD effluent analysis showed turbidity, total WBC count of 1 480 cells/mm3, and 83% polymorphonuclear cells. Her dialysate bacteria culture, fungus culture, polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB-PCR), acid-fast stain were all negative. On admission day 4, the treatments were changed to levofloxacin 200 mg once a day and vancomycin 500 mg every other day. After two weeks of antibiotics treatment, patient's symptoms were not completely improved and her dialysis effluent remained cloudy. Her blood eosinophil count elevated to 36.8%eosinophil proportion in PD effluent>90% and PD effluent pathological findings showed eosinophil>90%. Eosinophilic peritonitis was diagnosed and a decision was made to give loratadine daily dose of 10 mg orally. The possible reasons might be the patient's allergy to some components of PD solution or connection systems in the beginning of PD, and this bacterial peritonitis episode, as well as the application of vancomycin, might lead to the fact that eosinophilic peritonitis acutely developed. For there was no improvement in clinical symptoms, loratadine was stopped, and the patient was discharged 18 days later, and received follow-up closely. Two months later, eosinophil count in blood and PD fluid decreased to normal range with no symptom. This case reminds us that in any PD-related peritonitis patient with prolonged symptoms after appropriate antibiotic therapy, and typical clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of eosinophilic peritonitis should be considered. For the count and percentage of eosinophils are not routinely reported in most laboratories, doctors need to contact the department of laboratory and the department of pathology, to confirm the cell count and proportion of eosinophils in dialysis effluent, so as to make the definite diagnosis, which can not only avoid antibiotics overuse, but also avoid antibiotics-induced eosinophilic peritonitis (such as vancomycin)."

Results: showed that the gene polymorphism,Fat-1(rs1280098,c.8798A &gt; C,p.Q2933P),was associated with the occurrence of spinal tuberculosis.Subsequently,the Sanger sequencing method was used to verify this mutation loci in both the control group and case group.Expression of Fat-1 was subsequently detected using real-time fluorescent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR). In addition,the levels of interleukin(IL)-12 and interferon gamma(IFN-),as well as other biochemical indicators were detected. Results There were 129(66.8%) AA genotypes,33(17.1%) AC genotypes,and 31(16.1%) CC genotypes in the case group,while there were 157(75.8%) AA genotypes,35(16.9%) AC genotypes,and 15(7.3%) CC genotypes in the control group.There was a significant difference between the two groups in the distribution of Fat-1 genotype(2=7.885,P=0.019). Logistic regression analysis of different genetic models showed that,in the additive model,CC homozygous mutation genotypes were correlated with increased incidences of spinal tuberculosis,while AC heterozygous mutation genotypes were associated with normal incidences of spinal tuberculosis(P&gt;0.05). In the dominant model,AC+CC mutation genotypes were correlated with increased incidences of spinal tuberculosis(P&lt;0.05);in the recessive model,CC homozygous mutation genotypes were correlated with increased incidences of spinal tuberculosis(P&lt;0.05);and the minor allele C of the polymorphism locus was related to the incidence of spinal tuberculosis(P&lt;0.05). The expression of Fat-1 in peripheral blood was lower in the case group than in the control group,while the levels of serum IL-12 and IFN- were higher in the case group compared with the control group(P&lt;0.05). The levels of lipoprotein A,C-reactive protein,erythrocyte sedimentation rate,and eosinophil counts in the case group were higher than those in the control group,while albumin level in the case group was lower than that in the control group(P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: The gene polymorphism,Fat-1,is associated with the occurrence of spinal tuberculosis.In addition,the mutation of the Fat-1 gene results in reduced levels of Fat-1 gene transcription,as well as increased levels of the inflammatory cytokines,IL-12 and IFN-,in serum.These test results provide a molecular mechanism for the early diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis.

Sixty patients with tuberculous pleurisy (observation group) and 60 patients with non-tuberculous pleurisy (control group) were enrolled in this study. T-Spot TB was performed to detect the pleural effusion of two groups of patients. Levels of IFN- and IL-27 in serum and pleural effusion were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Relative expression of IFN- mRNA and IL-27 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected by RT-PCR. Positive rate of T-Spot TB in observation group was 96.7% (58 cases), which was significantly higher than that in control group (p<0.05). Concentration of INF- in pleural effusion of observation group was 468.624.8 ng/l, which was significantly higher than that in control group (131.318.7 ng/l, p<0.05). Concentration of IL-27 in pleural effusion of observation group was 423.437.2 ng/l, which was significantly higher than that in control group (116.215.5 ng/l, p<0.05). Concentrations of INF- and IL-27 in serum of observation group were 48.213.4 and 41.710.6 ng/l, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in control group (38.611.2 and 35.38.4 ng/l, p<0.05). Relative expression levels of INF- mRNA and IL-27 mRNA in observation group were significantly higher than those in control group (p<0.05). Therefore, combination of T-Spot TB with INF- and IL-27 has significant application value in the clinical diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy, and should be popularized.  2018, Spandidos Publications.

Herein, we report a case of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis, in which the diagnosis was made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and direct smear examination for acid-fast bacilli. A 95-year-old female patient was referred to us with a cervical mass. She had undergone surgical incision and drainage for a left cervical abscess four months previously. One month later, she was referred for plastic surgery to treat a fistula that had developed at the site of incision. Three months thereafter, she was referred to us from the plastic surgery department for a right cervical mass with redness of the overlying skin. Ultrasonography revealed a mass with an irregular margin, poor blood flow, and heterogeneous contents on the right side of her neck. Cervical lymphadenitis was suspected and an antibiotic was prescribed. However, the size of the mass increased and an abscess evolved. The T-SPOT.TB blood test was positive, indicating the diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis. We aspirated pus from the mass, and examination of direct smears of the pus and PCR revealed the causative organism as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Based on this experience, we recommend the use of PCR, direct smear examination, and interferon- release assays, such as T-SPOT.TB, for confirming the diagnosis of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis.  2018 Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

Based on the symptoms, chest X-rays and their correlation with clinical and diagnostic parameters, we had suspected diabetic-tuberculosis co-infections. As Chest X-Ray plays a vital role in the identification of pulmonary tuberculosis infections, we emphasized more on it. Chest X-ray features included were; (infiltrate, cavitation, miliary shadows, pleural effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and extent of lesions) such features were analyzed to identify associations with biological/clinical parameters through univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Method: The study was carried out in diabetic type 2 patients suspected with pulmonary tuberculosis infections, Warangal, India. Spoligotyping was used for identification, detection and characterization of M. tuberculosis complex bacteria in clinical samples. This method is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a highly polymorphic direct repeat locus in the M. tuberculosis genome. It is helpful in detecting causative bacteria and in providing epidemiologic information on genotyping strain identities. Results: Based on the chest X-Ray of 200 diabetic patients suspected with pulmonary infections, we found 26 infiltrates, 30 cavitation, 28 miliary shadows, 35 pleural effusion, 46 mediastinal lymphadenopathy and 35 were confirmed for the extent of lesions, which supported us to further screen for pulmonary tuberculosis of 200 subjects tested, 113 were males, 85 were females and 2 were children. All 200 subjects were tested for pulmonary tuberculosis, 36 were positive by smear microscopy and 20 were culture positive. Phenotypic and genotypic variations were found for all the 20 identified clinical isolates, by conventional and molecular methods of 20 clinical isolates, 4 MDR-TB were identified based on the Drug Susceptibility Test for first-line drugs. Of 20 clinical isolates, we took 10 clinical isolates (4-were MDR-TB and 6-were MTB) and 1-was control sample of H37RV used for spoligotyping and showed different patterns Bejing (1) and Lineages of East Asian, of family EA13(2) and Lineages of Indo-Oceanic, of family LAM1(1) and Lineages of Euro-American and 6 were found to be MTB of family 33(2) and Lineages of Indo-Oceanic, of family CAS(4) and Lineages of Un-known family. CAS (Central Asian) of M.tuberculosis strains showed more prevailing spoligotype pattern in Diabetic Pulmonary Tuberculosis patients. Conclusion: Implementing such a method in clinical settings would be useful in surveillance of tuberculosis transmission and in interventions to prevent further spread of this disease among the Diabetic Pulmonary Tuberculosis co-infections.  2018 Bentham Science Publishers."

Mycobacterial spindle cell pseudotumour (MSP) is a rare pseudotumour. It is a benign proliferation of spindle-shaped histiocytes containing acidfast mycobacterium, commonly reported in immunocompromised patients. MSP is usually associated with mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Here, we present the case of a 38-year-old gentleman with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who presented with low-grade fever for 1-month duration. Clinically, he had generalised lymphadenopathy. Chest X-ray showed miliary infiltration in bilateral lung fields. Lymph nodal biopsy showed spindle-shaped histiocytes filled with acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, suggestive of MSP. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains were positive for CD68, S-100 and negative for CD31, which are consistent with MSP. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the biopsy tissue was positive for MTB. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was continued and antitubercular therapy (ATT) was started. The fever resolved within two weeks and there was a resolution of lymph nodal swelling by 6 weeks. The diagnosis of MSP associated with mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) makes our case interesting. It is of utmost importance to differentiate MSP from Kaposis sarcoma (KS) and other pseudotumours and to know whether it is of tubercular or non-tubercular origin, as the treatment is entirely different.  2018, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

Molecular diagnostic tests that can detect pathogens in multiple specimen types including blood, sputum, stool, urine or cerebrospinal fluid, can decrease the time to diagnosis often to less than 1 hour and improve both antimicrobial use and associated infection prevention measures. Although molecular tests typically demonstrate high degrees of sensitivity and specificity, their cost and the lack of outcome studies showing their positive impact on patient management can be impediments to uptake in laboratories. Areas covered: Diagnostic tests used to identify a broad range of infectious agents causing respiratory tract infections, sexually transmitted infections, sepsis, as well as tests for biomarkers indicative of infection are reviewed. Data are based on a search of the literature using PubMed. Expert commentary: Rapid molecular diagnostic methods are the standard of care for many sexually transmitted diseases and are used increasingly to identify agents of sepsis. Host response markers to identify the presence of infection and differentiate between bacterial and viral agents will be the next major wave of diagnostic tools. Barriers to implementation of molecular diagnostic tests include siloed hospital budgets and the reluctance of many physicians to switch to rapid technologies that, while often superior to traditional microbiological methods in sensitivity and specificity, have little published outcome data to support their use.  2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."

The CF clinical phenotype shows wide variation ranging from severe disease in early childhood in those homozygous for the p.Phe508del mutation to absence of the vas deferens in otherwise healthy men homozygous for the p.Arg117His mutation. Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from whole blood from 62 patients with CF. The CFTR mutation was determined by Allele-Specific PCR assay. The spearman and linear regression analysis were used to obtain the correlation between phenotype and genotype relationship. Results: Out of total 62 patients, 35 (56.4%) were male. The mean age of the patients was 15.56  6.65 years. Mutations in CFTR were detected in 64.5% of the patients. The commonest mutations were p.Phe508del (33.9%), p.Arg117His; [5T] (5.64%), p.Arg117His; [7T] (4.03%) and p.Trp1282X (5.64%). Mutations p.Ile507del (4%), p.Gly542X (4%), p.Asn1303Lys (2.42%), c.489+1G>T (1.6%), p.Gly551Asp (1.6%) and c.1585-1G>A (1.6%) were also detected. Most mutations were detected in west and south of Iran, while p.Phe508del mutation was dominant mutation (75%) in east and southeast of Iran. The study showed either an association between this mutation with severity of disease and sex or an association between p.Arg117His mutations and age at diagnosis. Conclusion: The geographic distribution of gene mutation in Iranian cystic fibrosis patients was very heterogenic. In spite of the study that showed a correlation between p.Phe508del and severity of disease, to find any correlation between genotype and phenotype a broad and multi-centered study is recommended.  2018 NRITLD, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Iran."

While quick alternative non-invasive tests, such as plasmatic adenosine deaminase levels, may prove useful for diagnosis, laparoscopy remains the gold standard for peritoneal tuberculosis, allowing for both direct examination and tissue sampling in view of culture and histologic analysis.  2017, Louvain Medical asbl.

This lesion is mainly caused by encephalitis toxoplasma and primary central nervous system lymphoma related to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which is difficult to distinguish using CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The gold standard of diagnosing focal brain lesion has been brain biopsy, but this examination is an invasive procedure that causes complications. The objective of this study is to obtain the rapid laboratory diagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) and EBV infection. In this experimental study, blood and cerebrospinal fluid were obtained from HIV patients who were admitted to the Neurology Department of Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. The samples were examined using duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect T. gondii and EBV. The first step was the optimization of duplex real-time PCR, including the annealing temperature, primer and probe concentration, elution volume, and template volume. Minimal DNA detection was used to measure minimal T. gondii and EBV. Cross reactions were determined for technical specificity using the bacteria and viruses Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, Candida spp, cytomegalovirus, herpes zoster virus, and varicella zoster virus. Duplex real-time PCR was applied optimally to patients. In the optimization of duplex real-time PCR, the annealing temperature of T. gondii and EBV were 58 C, the concentration of primer forward and reverse for T. gondii and EBV were 0.2 M, the concentration of probe for T. gondii and EBV were 0.4M and 0.2 M, respectively. Minimal DNA detection of T. gondii and EBV were 5.68 copy/ml and 1.31 copy/ml, respectively. There was no cross reaction between another bacteria and virus that were used as the primer and probe for T. gondii and EBV. The blood duplex real-time PCR was positive for T. gondii (16%), EBV (40%), and both (16%). The cerebrospinal fluid samples were positive for T. gondii (20%), EBV (28%), and both (4%).

Twenty-four (24) patients MDRTB patients and 24 newly diagnosed DSTB patients from University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan, Nigeria were recruited for the study by a Consultant Chest physician using clinical history, Chest X-ray and GENE Xpert test. Five (5) milliliters of blood was drawn from the anti-cubital fossa vein into lithium heparin tubes before the commencement of chemotherapy, 2 months, 4 months and 6 months of anti-TB therapy. Plasma obtained was analyzed for C-RP and fibrinogen using ELISA. Data was presented as mean  SD. Student t-test was used for mean comparison. Statistical significance was set at p  0.05. Mean CRP level in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis patients was significantly higher at diagnosis compared with controls. Mean fibrinogen levels in the drug sensitive and multi drug resistant tuberculosis were significantly lower at diagnosis compared to controls. The mean CRP and fibrinogen levels in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis were significantly reduced during chemotherapy compared with before commencement of chemotherapy.

M. tuberculosis was subsequently isolated from the gastric aspirate specimen. After 2 months of treatment with antituberculous medication, the patient developed alow grade fever and left-sided chest pain. A CT scan revealed a left pleural effusion and a right subphrenic abscess. Tuber-culous pleurisy with paradoxical response was diagnosed on the basis of an increased lymphocyte count and increased adenosine deaminase activity in the pleural fluid exudate. A percutaneous ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the sub-phrenic abscess was performed. Histological analysis revealed epithelioid cell granulomas with necrosis and PCR for M. tuberculosis using puncture needle washing fluid returned positive results.

The traditional focus on the patterns of reductionism which was associated with single molecular changes has been unable to meet the demand of early diagnosis and clinical application when current tuberculosis infection happened. In this study, we employed a systems biology approach to collect large microarray data sets including mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) to identify the differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs in the whole blood of TB patients. The aim was to identify key genes associated with the immune response in the pathogenic process of tuberculosis by analyzing the co-regulatory network that was consisted of transcription factors and miRNAs as well as their target genes. The network along with their co-regulatory genes was analyzed utilizing Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED) and Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). We got 21 (19 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes that were co-regulated by transcription factors and miRNAs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the 21 differentially expressed genes were predominantly involved in Tuberculosis signaling pathway, which may play a major role in tuberculosis biological process. Quantitative realtime PCR was performed to verify the over expression of co-regulatory genes (FCGR1A and CEBPB). The genetic expression was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics in TB patients and inferences drawn. Our results suggest the TF-miRNA gene co-regulatory network may help us further understand the molecular mechanism of immune response to tuberculosis and provide us a new angle of future biomarker and therapeutic targets.  2017, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Pakistan ranks fourth amongst high burden countries for TB in the world. Mediastinal involvement is rare in particular in the forms of lymphadenitis without lung damaging. The typology of the migration flows has modified the tuberculosis epidemiological distribution and the number of the extrapulmonary cases are increasing in Europe and in Italy. Diagnosis of mediastinal tuberculosis is difficult as the clinical presentation lacks specificity, imaging studies do not provide conclusive information and the differential diagnosis is a common challenge in clinical practice. The suspect of tuberculosis must be considered including acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining (Ziehl-Nielsen and auramine), cultures and nucleic acid technology methods. We report two cases of mediastinal tuberculosis without a pulmonary tuberculosis in immunocompetent patients. This last condition, makes our cases even more rare. The first case is a man of 48-years-old presented with syncope, arrhythmia and weight loss of 20 kg during the last four months. The second case is a man of 29-years-old presented with fever (102F), dry cough and nocturnal sweating. The process that lead to the diagnosis of mediastinal tuberculosis, particularly in immunocompetent patients and without a concurrent diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, is difficult to implement in a general clinical practice. These cases require a close examination of the differential diagnosis and the different and complex clinical pictures related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis must not be excluded. Moreover, it is needed to adopt and coordinate both mini-invasive diagnostic systems (e.g. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration, EBUS-TBNA) and mycobacterial tests (microscopy, cultures and nucleic acid amplification techniques, NAAT) able to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of tuberculosis with an acceptable precision. Our cases demonstrated the key role of mycobacterial cultures in the diagnosis of these rare forms of mediastinal tuberculosis.  2016, Societ Italiana di Patologia Clinica e Medicina di Laboratorio."

The incidence of PD has recently increased in Europe and the United States, mainly due to immigration; however, it is still a rare diagnosis in Scandinavian countries, and if overlooked it might lead to significant neurologic complications. Case Report: A 78-year-old woman, originally from Eastern Europe, presented to the emergency department with a complaint of nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and severe back pain. On admission she was febrile and had leukocytosis and increased C-reactive protein. Initial spinal x-ray was performed and revealed osteolytic changes in the vertebral body of T11 and T12. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine illustrated spondylitis of T10, T11, and T12, with multiple paravertebral and epidural abscesses, which was suggestive of PD. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the patients gastric fluid was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT). Based on MRI and PCR findings, standard treatment for TB was initiated. Results of the spine biopsy and culture showed colonies of MT and confirmed the diagnosis afterwards. Due to the instability of the spine and severe and continuous pain, spine-stabilizing surgery was performed. Her TB was cured after nine months of treatment. Conclusions: PD is an important differential diagnosis of malignancy that should be diagnosed instantly. History of exposure to TB and classic radiologic finding can help make the diagnosis.

METHODS: Microarray screening and qRT-PCR verification of lncRNAs and mRNAs were performed in CD and control subjects, followed by hierarchy cluster ing, GO and KEGG pathway analyses. Significantly dysregulated lncRNAs were categorized into subgroups of antisense lncRNAs, enhancer lncRNAs and lincRNAs. To predict the regulatory effect of lncRNAs on mRNAs, a CNC network analysis was performed and cross linked with significantly changed lncRNAs. The overlapping lncRNAs were randomly selected and verified by qRT-PCR in a larger cohort. RESULTS: Initially, there were 1211 up-regulated and 777 down-regulated lncRNAs as well as 1020 up-regulated and 953 down-regulated mRNAs after microarray analysis; a heat map based on these results showed good categorization into the CD and control groups. GUSBP2 and AF113016 had the highest fold change of the up- And down-regulated lncRNAs, whereas TBC1D17 and CCL3L3 had the highest foldchange of the up- And down-regulated mRNAs. Six (SNX1, CYFIP2, CD6, CMTM8, STAT4 and IGFBP7) of 10 mRNAs and 8 (NR-033913, NR-038218, NR-036512, NR-049759, NR-033951, NR-045408, NR-038377 and NR-039976) of 14 lncRNAs showed the same change trends on the microarray and qRT-PCR results with statistical significance. Based on the qRT-PCR verified mRNAs, 1358 potential lncRNAs with 2697 positive correlations and 2287 negative correlations were predicted by the CNC network.

Methods: The hbha gene was amplified from the genome of M. tb H37Rv by PCR and cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET-28a (+). The constructed recombinant plasmid pET-28ah was transformed to E. coli BL2l(DE3) for expression under induction of IPTG. The expressed recombinant HBHA (rHBHA) was purified by nickel ion affinity chromatography and analyzed for antigenic specificity by Western blot. Serum samples were collected from 71 patients with TB and 30 healthy volunteers, and determined for IgA and IgG levels against HBHA by ELISA, based on which the significance of rHBHA in serological diagnosis of TB was evaluated using ESAT-6 and Ag85A as control antigens. Results: Both restriction analysis and sequencing proved that recombinant plasmid pET-28ah was constructed correctly. The expressed recombinant HBHA mainly existed in a form of inclusion body, and reached a high purity after purification by nickel ion affinity chromatography. The purified HBHA showed specific binding to mouse anti-His tag monoclonal antibody. The IgG levels against rHBHA, ESAT-6 and Ag85A as well as IgA level against rHBHA in patients with TB were significantly higher than those in healthy volunteers as control (P < 0. 05). However, the IgA levels against ESAT-6 and Ag85A in two groups showed no significant difference (P < 0. 05).

In this paper, micro-cantilever beam based bio-sensing system is designed and analyzed for the detection of bio-molecules. Modal and static analysis is performed to study the vibration frequencies and deflection of cantilever respectively. The surface of the cantilever is coated with the anti-bodies of the suspected antigen in a patient's blood. The anti-bodies are specific for specific antigens. Hence, the presence of mycobacterium tuberculosis in a suspected patient's blood is identified through the deflection of cantilever beam. The deflection of the beam is detected using capacitance method. 3D finite element analysis is performed to study the stability, sensitivity and modal frequencies of the cantilever beam(s). The modal frequencies are very important in vibration to voltage conversion of a capacitor for deflection detection. Fixed beam and stepped beam are also considered for comparison. The model is found to be cost effective as well as simple when compared to the conventional techniques like ELISA and PCR.  2016 IEEE."

Nucleic acid detection tests (NATs) have greatly improved the ability to detect respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens that do not normally colonize the respiratory tract. In contrast, NATs do not yet have an established role for diagnosing pneumonia caused by bacteria that commonly colonize the nasopharynx due to difficulties discriminating between pathogens and coincidental carriage strains. New approaches are needed to distinguish infection from colonization, such as through use of quantitative methods and identification of discriminating cut-off levels. The recent realization that the lung microbiome exists has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of pneumonia involving the interaction between multiple microorganisms. New developments in molecular diagnostics must account for this new paradigm.  2016 Taylor & Francis."

Diagnosis is confirmed by culture of a pathological sample or by histological examination of a biopsy of the affected tissue or organ for M. tuberculosis. Case report: 21 years old female known with HIV Infection Category C3 (CD4 -10 cells / mm3), treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) since November 2014, diagnosed in January 2015 with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy, tetra-ataxia, tetra paresis and secondary epilepsy with repeated admissions to an Infectious Department of our hospital for prolonged febrile syndrome, nausea and weight loss is thoroughly investigated for hepatosplenic abscesses identified by CT-scan. In May 2015 a liver biopsy performed in a Hospital in Bucharest and Real Time PCR identified M. tuberculosis 610,000 copies/ml and Rifampicin resistance gene present. Culture confirmed M. tuberculosis. Extended DST (after 60 days) revealed sensitivity just for Ethionamide - tuberculosis XDR (extensively resistant). Initial treatment with tuberculosis drugs according to regimen WHO category 1 was individualized for the identified resistances. ART was also modified because of resistance to Rifampicin. Her condition slowly improved with fever remission and improvement of biological inflammatory syndrome and neurological manifestations associating physical therapy and specialized treatment. Conclusions: Extremely rare and very serious case of XDR TB with atypical localizations due to marked immunodeficiency. It represents a therapeutic challenge involving a multidisciplinary team and prolonged admissions in many specialized departments. Copyright  2016 CELSIUS."

We investigated whether a rapid diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) could be established by interferon- blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests in children. We used the QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube test (QFT-IT) on blood and the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT-G) on the CSF of 63 subjects with TBM (including 25 case of definite TBM and 38 cases of probable TBM) and 62 controls. The CSF analyses indicated possible TBM in 63.4% of cases. The sensitivity of the CSF culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was only 39.6%. The sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test (TST) was 49.2% and the specificity was 88.6%. The estimated sensitivities of the QFT-G for the CSF and QFT-IT for the blood in culture confirmed TBM cases (gold standard) were 84% and 80%, respectively. The estimated specificities were 98.2% for the CSF and 87.9% for the blood. This study showed that the sensitivity of QFT for the CSF could be higher than TST and culture and slightly higher in CSF than in blood. The specificity of QFT-G for the CSF was higher those of the TST, but the specificity of QFT-IT is lower. QFT-G of the CSF is a useful diagnostic marker of tuberculosis that may improve the management of TBM, but the test results must be correlated with clinical, radiological and characteristics of CSF. New researches are needed to investigate the performance of QFT-G in the CSF compared with ELISPOT and PCR.  2015, University of Medicine and Pharmacy Targu Mures. All rights reserved."

Current conventional techniques lack sensitivity and are time-consuming. Here, we report our experience with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) using two targets namely IS6110 and protein antigen b in the diagnosis of extra-pulmonary TB. Materials and Methods: A total of 150 patients of extra-pulmonary TB visiting tertiary care center in north India between September 2008 and December 2009 were included in the study. Sixty-six biopsy samples and 84 were body fluids from these patients were subjected for microscopy (Ziehl-Neelsen), culture on LJ medium and for Multiplex PCR using IS6110 and Protein b antigen. Results: Smear positivity was noted in 11 samples (7.33%), and LJ culture yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 8 biopsies and 9 body fluids with overall positivity of 11.3%. The multi-targeted PCR could detect M. tuberculosis in a total of 112 samples. Of 112 positive samples, only Protein b band was detected in 7 samples and only IS6110 was detected in 5 samples. Overall Protein b, PCR could detect 71.33% of the cases, whereas IS6110 was positive in 66.6% of the cases. Overall the sensitivities of microscopy, culture, IS6110 PCR, Protein b PCR and MPCR were 7.33%, 11.3%, 66.67%, 71.3% and 74.6%, respectively. Thus by using more than two targets the sensitivity increased from 66.67% of IS6110 to 74.6% in MPCR. Conclusion: Multiplex polymerase chain reaction using IS6110 and Protein b antigen is a highly sensitive and specific tool in the diagnosis of pauci-bacillary conditions like extra-pulmonary TB."

But the indications of IVF-ET must be strictly controlled by the clinicians. Case report: We described a case of a 29-year-old pregnant Chinese woman with military tuberculosis. She was admitted to the hospital with complaints of fever and shortness of breath. She received IVF-ET 83 days ago, because of infertility with bilateraltubal occlusion, and was in pregnancy status. We presented the clinical, laboratory and two chest CT scan features of the patient. The second chest CT scan showed randomly distributed, innumerable tiny, military nodules throughout the lungs. The fluorescence quantitative PCR of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The M. tuberculosis was cultured from BALF on Day 29.

They are associated with frequent development of permanent, debilitating consequences or even death. The aim of this work was to determine potentially preventable agents by vaccinations in patients who were hospitalized in the years 2004-2013 at the Department of Infectious Diseases of the University Hospital Ostrava. The prospective study included 1463 patients, of which 283 patients had purulent meningitis and 1,180 patients had aseptic meningitis. The criterion for the diagnosis was the number of elements in cerebrospinal fluid over 5x106/l. The diagnosis of purulent meningitis was established by cultivation cerebrospinal fluid and blood culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. The diagnosis of aseptic meningitis was established by serological tests for tick-borne encephalitis, enterovirus, mumps, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Lyme disease. PCR was used to investigate enterovirus, influenza virus, and herpes viruses. Among the 283 patients with purulent meningitis, potentially preventable agents were detected in 124 cases (44%), of which 70 cases it was Streptococcus pneumoniae, in 51 cases Neisseria meningitidis, in 7 cases Haemophilus influenzae type b and in 1 case Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among the 1,180 patients with aseptic meningitis potentially preventable agents were detected in 257 cases (22%). Tick-borne encephalitis in 186 cases, 54 cases of varicella zoster virus infection, 14 cases of mumps and 3 cases of flu. From the results we can state that vaccination is an important prevention of neuroinfections and it is desirable to increase immunization coverage especially of risk populations.  2015, Medakta s.r.o.

A case of liver hilar tuberculous lymphadenitis mimicking lymph node metastasis of anal canal cancer that was successfully diagnosed by laparoscopic lymph node biopsy is reported. Presentation of case A 49-year-old man with a past medical history of pulmonary tuberculosis suffering from anal canal cancer with left inguinal lymph node metastasis underwent laparoscopic anterior perineal resection and left inguinal lymph node dissection in February 2010. Subsequently, he underwent dissection of right inguinal lymph node metastases from anal canal cancer twice in February and October 2013. In July 2014, follow-up computed tomography (CT) showed a 26 mm  23 mm lesion with calcification on the anterior side of the portal vein in the hepatoduodenal ligament. He had no jaundice. Positron emission tomography with 2[18 F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG-PET) revealed a mass with high uptake. Suspecting a lymph node metastasis from anal canal cancer, laparoscopic lymph node biopsy was performed. Histopathological and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examinations yielded a diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis. No evidence of recurrence of cancer has been seen during the 5 years of follow-up after the surgery for anal canal cancer. Discussion FDG-PET imaging is rarely useful for differentiating cancer from tuberculosis lesions. Laparoscopic lymph node biopsy is a safe, effective alternative to open surgical biopsy. Conclusion Tuberculous lymphadenitis should be included among the differential diagnoses of liver hilar lymphadenopathy in patients with a history of tuberculous. Laparoscopic lymph node biopsy is useful for the diagnosis of undiagnosed lymphadenopathy.  2015 The Authors."

They can have a devastating impact with a high rate of serious and long-lasting sequelae, especially on remaining growth. Depending on the localisation of infection, they manifest as osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, a combination of both (i.e., osteomyelitis with adjacent septic arthritis) or spondylodiscitis. Osteoarticular infections can be divided into three types according to the source of infection: haematogenous; secondary to contiguous infection; or secondary to direct inoculation. During the last few years, many principles regarding diagnostic assays and the microbiological causes of these infections have evolved in a significant manner. In the present current-opinion review, we discuss recent concepts regarding epidemiology, physiopathology, and the microbiology of bone and joint infections in young children, as well as clinical presentations, diagnosis, and treatment of these infections. Clinicians caring for children need to be especially well versed in these newer concepts as they can be used to guide evaluation and treatment."

A total of 508 clinical specimens (blood 343, menstrual fluid 53, endometrial tissue 43, body fluid 36, pus from lymph nodes 18, sputum 8, urine 5 and semen 2) were included in this study. We extracted DNA using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and performed real-time assay using Rotor-Gene Q machine from Corbett Research, Australia for specific amplification of IS6110 sequence of mycobacterial genome. The RT-PCR result was also compared with bacterial culture and acid-fast bacillus staining. RT-PCR assay showed positivity in 52 cases and negative in 456 cases. Corresponding positive results in culture and acid-fast bacillus staining methods were 49 cases and 24 cases respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis by RT-PCR were 93.87% and 98.69% respectively taking positive culture results as reference standards. The overall positive and negative predictive values were 88.46% and 99.34% respectively. RT-PCR is a useful diagnostic tool for rapid and sensitive detection of mycobacteria in different clinical samples. The easy processing, fast reporting and relative lack of contamination issues make it worthy as a possible replacement to time consuming culture techniques. Moreover, it has added advantage of quantification of mycobacterial DNA, hence bacterial load."

The aim of this study was to determine if the Xpert MTB/rifampicin (RIF) assay had additional advantages over nested PCR for the detection of MTB in a geographical area with intermediate tuberculosis (TB) incidence. Methods: Between February and December 2013, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR, as well as AFB smear and culture, were simultaneously performed on 198 clinical samples (160 pulmonary and 38 non-pulmonary specimens) collected from 171 patients hospitalized at Hallym University Medical Center for possible TB. The accuracy of the diagnosis of MTB culture-positive TB and the turnaround time of reporting laboratory results were calculated and compared. Rifampin resistance by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay was reviewed with that of conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). Results: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR for diagnosis of MTB culture-positive pulmonary TB were 86.1% vs. 69.4% (P=0.1563), 97.8% vs. 94.1% (P=0.2173), 91.2% vs. 75.8% (P=0.1695), and 96.4% vs. 92.0% (P=0.2032), respectively. The median turnaround times of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR were 0 [0-4] days and 4 [1-11] days, respectively (P < 0.001). Two cases of rifampin resistance, as determined by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, were found to be multi-drug resistant (MDR) pulmonary TB by DST. Conclusions: The Xpert MTB/RIF assay seemed to be sensitive, specific, and comparable to nested PCR for identifying MTB among clinically suspected TB patients, and the assay can be valuable in giving a timely identification of resistance to rifampin.

Failure to accurately identify cases of active MTB has serious effects on both patients and the community. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear has poor sensitivity and culture methods have a delay ranging from 1 to 8 weeks for diagnosis. Nucleic acid amplification assays may be suitable candidates for this purpose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, we evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in 190 patients with pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis whom were admitted to Tehran Imam Khomeini hospitals during 2006-2010. Three ml citrated blood samples were obtained from cases. DNA extraction was performed by QIAGEN commercial kit and PCR performed with IS1081 Primer. RESULTS: Fifty six cases had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and 134 were pulmonary. Overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 41.1% and 95.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MTB-PCR assay on PBMC using IS1081 primer has a low sensitivity and now can not use as a single or alternative diagnostic test for tuberculosis. However, with regard to its high specificity can use for help diagnosing of TB in cases have no enough sputum (or other specimens) to examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture."

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is widely used for adjunct diagnosis of E-TB with extrasanguinous fluid. However, ADA is not a specific marker for E-TB, so a more specific test is urgently needed for the confirmation of E-TB. Recently, an IFN-gamma releasing assay using peripheral blood mononuclear cells and extrasanguinous fluid mononuclear cells, and the newly-developed Xpert MTB/RFP have shown promising results for the rapid diagnosis of E-TB. Although the regimen of antituberculous medication for E-TB is similar to that for pulmonary tuberculosis, the treatment of E-TB is occasionally complicated due to a paradoxical response during antituberculous therapy and after the completion of antituberculous therapy, especially in tuberculous lymphadenopathy. The proposed algorithm for the management of paradoxical response in tuberculous lymphadenopathy is presented, and the treatment for E-TB in various sites is briefly reviewed.  2014 Korean Medical Association."

Methods: Mtb ClpP2 was cloned into recombinant plasmid pET32a (+) and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed to detect the expression of the recombinant protein. The immunogenicity of Mtb ClpP2 was assessed with epitope prediction and antibody titer assay. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the influence of stress conditions on ClpP2 expression. ClpP2 antigen and antibody in patients with pulmonary diseases were detected by indirect ELISA. ROC curve was constructed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Mtb ClpP2 for tuberculosis. Results: We had cloned and expressed recombinant Mtb ClpP2 in E. coli. Our results showed that Mtb ClpP2 had potent immunogenicity, and our own prepared polyclonal antibody could be used in detection and diagnostic tests. Results from Western blot showed that ClpP2 was mainly located in M. bovis BCG cytoplasm, and real-time PCR indicated that stress conditions could enhance the mRNA expression of ClpP2. Indirect ELISA suggested that, in tuberculosis patients, both the levels of ClpP2 antigen and antibody were increased, and the positive rates of ClpP2 were elevated. ROC curve had demonstrated satisfactory sensitivity and specificity of ClpP2-based diagnosis for tuberculosis. Conclusion: Our results suggest that Mtb ClpP2 antigens would be used as a biomarker in tuberculosis pathogenesis. These findings highlight the feasibility of the application of Mtb ClpP2 in the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis."

Mycobacterium bovis is the main etiological agent of bTB which is an acid fast staining bacterium due to waxy substance (mycolic acid) present in its bacterial cell wall. The bacteria can be transmitted by both aerogenous and enterogenous routes. Disease causes development of miliary tubercular lesions, chronic cough, obstructions of air passages and alimentary tract or blood vessels and enlargement of lymph nodes. A spectrum of Cell-Mediated Immune responses (CMI) predominate infection, projecting the role of macrophages and T-cell populations. In advanced stage, there is increased humoral response. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) have been widely used for the detection of M. tuberculosis complex in clinical samples. Single intradermal test, short thermal test and Stormont tests are the valuable delayed type of hypersensitivity tests. Gamma interferon assay, lymphocyte proliferation assay, Enzyme Linked Immune Sorbent Assay (ELISA), multiantigen print immunoassay (MAPIA), Fluorescent Polarization Assay (FPA), immunochromatographic lateral flow test, single antigen as well as multiplex chemiluminescence assays are the various blood-based laboratory tests. Attenuated bovine-strain of tuberculosis bacterium, known as Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin (BCG) is used as vaccine. The present review addresses important insights into the bovine TB, a complex and multi-species disease, the etiological agent, advances and trends in its diagnosis, vaccine development and treatment options and the public health significance of this important disease which would altogether help devising effective strategies for prevention and control of tuberculosis in cattle as well as in wildlife.  2014 Academic Journals Inc."

Corticosteroid intake is known to predispose individuals to the development of these two conditions.1,2 In AVN, corticosteroid remains to be the most common cause that leads to a final common pathway of disrupting blood supply to segments of bone causing cell death.1In TB arthritis, corticosteroid renders a patient relatively immunocompromised predisposing to this extra-pulmonary infection. The incidence of tubercular osteonecrosis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus is rare. A review of literature only showed one case report of tubercular osteonecrosis diagnosed by aspiration cytology.3Since tuberculosis (TB) is a destructive but curable disease, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. Objective: To present a case of tubercular osteonecrosis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus treated with anti-Kochs regimen and iloprost infusion. Case: A 27-year old Fi l i p i no female who was diagnosed with lupus nephritis and underwent three days methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Lupus nephritis improved and was clinically inactive for two years. She developed insidious onset of intermittent pain on her left knee, associated with swelling for four months with subsequent right hip pain of one week duration. MRI of the left knee showed osteonecrosis and arthritis. Radiograph of the right hip showed osteonecrosis. She underwent arthrocentesis of the left knee and the synovial fluid tested positive for tuberculosis by PCR. We started the patient on quadruple anti-Kochs regimen together with iloprost infusion which afforded clinical improvement. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a lupus patient with concomitant polyarticular osteonecrosis complicated by monoarticular tuberculous arthritis. Medical treatment, while it may be complicated by adverse drug events, is effective in symptomatic treatment, but a multidisciplinary approach is suggested for optimal outcome.  2014 Philippine College of Physicians.

We present a case of a little boy in which neglected foreign body aspiration led to focal bronchiectasis and pulmonary fibrosis, surgically cured by left inferior lobectomy. A nine-year-old boy was admitted into our clinic for chronic productive cough and persistent pulmonary crackles, which occurred approximately 4 months ago. His father had pulmonary tuberculosis, for which the little boy was tested and was found to be negative (intradermal reaction, gastric lavage). Despite the use of various antibiotics, the findings on auscultation of the chest were persistantly abnormal. History revealed foreign body aspiration (sunflower seed) six years ago, followed by lung abscess, complicated with empyema, pyopneumothorax and cardiorespiratory arrest successfully resuscitated. Physical examination showed good general status, paleness, old linear scar on the left hemithorax, productive cough, wet crackles at the left lung base. CBC, ESR, PCR, serum immunoglobulins, 1-antitripsine, sweat chloride values were normal, sputum culture was negative. Esophageal pH-metry was negative for GERD. Chest X-ray showed left basal hypertransparent area and accentuated basal interstitium. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, mucolytics, chest percussion and postural drainage were started with no clinical amelioration. CT scan showed cylindrical dilatations (bronchiectasis) in segments 9 and 10 of the left lung with interstitial fibrosis. An inferior left lobectomy was performed; and histology of the specimen confirmed bronchiectasis and fibrosis, and revealed no congenital anomalies. The patient was discharged in good general condition after 3 weeks; clinical and radiological findings after 3 months showed absence of respiratory symptoms and expansion of the left lung to the thoracic cage. In foreign body aspiration early diagnosis and appropriate treatment are important in order to prevent long-term complications. In our case, because of delayed referral and lack of early bronchoscopy, the neglected foreign body produced focal bronchiectasis and basal fibrosis that necessitated surgery."

A frequent cause of sudden death in adults is related to cardiovascular disease. Sudden cardiac death is defined as death due to cardiac causes, and preceded by an abrupt and unexpected loss of consciousness within one hour of the onset of acute symptoms, in an individual who may have or not known pre-existing heart disease. In the young adults, myocarditis is the major cause of sudden unexpected death. Tuberculosis (TB) is still a serious problem for public health, even in highly developed countries. In the latest World Health Organization (WHO) report, TB was responsible for 8.5-9.2 million cases and 1.2-1.5 million deaths (including deaths from TB among HIV-positive people). TB is also more common among men than women, and around 2/3 of cases are estimated to occur among people aged 15-59 years. Tuberculosis has a predilection for the pulmonary system; extrapulmonary manifestation is rare, but around 1-2% of TB patients have cardiovascular involvement (MTB). MTB can present in a miliary or nodular form, occasionally with aneurysm. The infection can reach the myocardium through the blood or the lymphatic system, or as a result of contiguity from pericardium or pulmonary cavity. In the past MTB was hardly ever diagnosed while the person was alive, but now the advancement in cardiac imaging and imaging guided biopsy techniques, lead to a more frequent antemortem diagnosis. Clinically, MTB may be asymptomatic or presenting with different manifestations including intractable ventricular arrhythmias, long QT syndrome, complete heart block and in some rare cases right atrial obstruction, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, superior vena cava obstruction, left ventricular aneurysm, aortic regurgitation and heart failure. The MTB average incidence on the total number of autopsies is < 0.3%. A systematic study relative to 13.658 autopsies reported a frequency of 0.14%. MTB represents up to 4% of all TB related deaths and the majority of TB related sudden death. Cases of sudden death from previously undiagnosed MTB have rarely been reported in the literature, and they refer frequently to male subjects. According to the clinical symptoms observed in living patients, the most probable mechanism for sudden cardiac death is cardiac arrhythmias. The autopsy diagnosis of MTB depends largely on the microscopic detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and on mycobacterial culture, but the demonstration of AFB within foci of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation is rare. In recent years, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for the detection of mycobacterial DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissues has been widely demonstrated in various tissue specimens, including heart, lung, lymph nodes, and other tissues. Differential diagnosis is from other forms of granulomatous inflammations including sarcoidosis and large cell idiopatic granulomatous myocarditis. A proposal of diagnostic criteria may comprise positive TB PCR, positive bacterial culture or acid-fast bacilli isolation from myocardium, since these tests provide definitive diagnosis.  2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We determined the relationship between disease severity and the sensitivity of new sputum-based and urine-based diagnostic assays. Methods: Consecutive ambulatory patients enrolling for antiretroviral treatment in South Africa were screened for TB regardless of symptoms using diagnostic assays prospectively applied to sputum (fluorescence smear microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF and liquid culture (reference standard)) and retrospectively applied to stored urine samples (Determine TB-LAM and Xpert MTB/RIF). Assay sensitivities were calculated stratified according to pre-defined indices of disease severity: CD4 count, symptom intensity, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), hemoglobin concentration and vital status at 90 days. Results: Sputum culture-positive TB was diagnosed in 15% (89/602) of patients screened and data from 86 patients were analyzed (median CD4 count, 131 cells/L) including 6 (7%) who died. The sensitivity of sputum microscopy was 26.7% overall and varied relatively little with disease severity. In marked contrast, the sensitivities of urine-based and sputum-based diagnosis using Determine TB-LAM and Xpert MTB/RIF assays were substantially greater in sub-groups with poorer prognosis. Rapid diagnosis from sputum and/or urine samples was possible in >80% of patients in sub-groups with poor prognosis as defined by either CD4 counts <100 cells/L, advanced symptoms, CRP concentrations >200 mg/L or hemoglobin <8.0 g/dl. Retrospective testing of urine samples with Determine TB-LAM correctly identified all those with TB who died. Conclusions: The sensitivities of Xpert MTB/RIF and Determine TB-LAM for HIV-associated TB were highest among HIV-infected patients with the most advanced disease and poorest prognostic characteristics. These data provide strong justification for large-scale intervention studies that assess the impact on survival of screening using these new sputum-based and urine-based diagnostic approaches.  2013 Lawn et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Clostridium difficile is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, disruption of the gut flora, typically by antibiotics, allows C. difficile to proliferate, thus resulting in infection C. difficileexerts its pathogenic effect mainly through the production of two exotoxins, toxin A and B. Usually, exposure to both antimicrobials andtoxin-producing C. difficile strains is necessary for the development of CDI. Host factors may be as important. CDI has a wide range of manifestations, causing a self-limited mild diarrheal illness to a fulminant life-threatening colitis. The two main risk factors for CDI are antibioticexposure and age older than 65 but other factors shouldalso be considered like the use of laxatives, proton pump inhibitors or H2 histamine as gastric protection, chemotherapy, renal failure, gastrointestinal surgery, nasogastric tube, mechanical ventilation, prolonged hospital stay. The most widely used diagnostic test for the diagnosis of CDI is the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for toxin A or toxins A and B. Other methods include:an antigen test that detects the mitochondrial enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) within C. difficile, used for screening, stool culture, the cytotoxicity cell assay, another highly sensitive and specific method is polymerase chain reaction( PCR), sensitivity being higher than 90% and specificity of 100%. Colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopyalso used in certain situations, abdominal X-ray is used in cases of ileus or toxic megacolon. For treatment different antibiotics are used: metronidazole, Vancomycin is recommended in severe cases, other treatment options include: Fidaxomicin, Nitazoxanide, rifaximin, Teicoplanin, tigecycline, bacitracin,andfusidic acid. Probiotics are found in fermented milk, yogurt, powders and capsules as lactobacillus, bifidobacteria and Saccharomyces boulardii. They act by inhibiting bacterial adhesion to the intestinal mucosa.There are case reports according to which the use of intravenous unspecific immunoglobulin will benefit patients in recurrence, but there is little data in the literature. While the effectiveness of immunoglobulins remains controversial, monoclonal antibodies directedagainst toxins A and B have been shown to be protective against further relapses when compared to placebo, leaving the door open for future research. Fecal transplants or fecal bacteriotherapy is very promising, with success rates greater than 90% in patients with recurrent infections. In this approach, the stool may be introduced by esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy or enema [89].In patients with fulminant infection, early surgery is important. Surgery showed a benefit compared to medical therapy, especially in patients with serum lactate >5 mmol/L and/or leukocytosis 50 x109/L. Cl.difficile can cause different rare cases including: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) that lead to death of a 22-year-old female university student following clindamycin treatment for coverage of a tooth extraction due to a dental abscess, the emergence of multidrug-resistant C. difficile PCR ribotype 046 may be detrimental to anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy, a case of C. difficile bacteremia in a patient who had underwent loop ileostomy is reported, mycoticaneurysm causedby C. difficile is also reported, the use of fecal transplantation as a safe and highly effective treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection is repoterd, Clostridium difficile Infection in Infants and Children is reported also, Clostridium difficile is reported to be the first identified autotrophic bacterial pathogen[104], and Clostridium difficile enteritis is also reported."

Studies have suggested that immunocompromised patients such as cancer patients, organ transplant recipients and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with positive CMV- polymerase chain reaction (PGR) results should be early initiated with antl-CMV therapy to reduce mortality. However, it remains controversial to treat the ICU patients without Immunosuppression when the CMV-PCR results were positive. The 74 years old man was brought to the Emergency Room of the hospital due to fever and short of breath. He was intubated for acute respiratory failure and was admitted to the ICU. The CXR showed diffuse miliary lesions over bilateral lung fields. The acid-fast bacilli stain and tuberculosis (TB)-PCR of the sputum both showed positive, so he was mainly given anti-TB therapy. But the patient continued with instability of oxygen saturation, and bilateral pneumonia has not improved. Meanwhile, the CMV-PCR of the sputum and blood showed positive, thus active CMV infection was suspected and ganciclovir infusion was Initiated. But afterS days of ganciclovir therapy, the patient still passed away.

The private sector in India is an important source of TB care with over 50% of TB patients seeking TB treatment in the private health sector. Early and accurate diagnosis is the first critical step in controlling TB. All persons with cough lasting two weeks or more, or with unexplained chronic fever and/or weight loss should be evaluated for TB. For pulmonary TB, Sputum is the most critical sample for laboratory testing. Although blood is a popular sample in the Indian private sector, there is no accepted, valid blood test for pulmonary TB. There are three accepted, validated sputum tests for active TB: Sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli; molecular or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT); and culture. Chest radiography is useful but is not specific for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. Therefore, chest radiography cannot provide a conclusive diagnosis on its own, and needs to be followed by sputum testing. If sputum smears and NAATs are negative, and TB is still suspected, cultures are the most sensitive tests available for TB.Culture is therefore very useful in diagnosing smear-negative TB, and drug-resistant TB. Blood-based antibody tests (eg, IgG/IgM tests) and interferon-gamma release assays (eg, TB Gold) are not accurate and should not be used for pulmonary TB diagnosis. In fact, use of serodiagnostic tests for TB is banned by the Government of India."

Diagnosis was based on PCR despite the detection of negative acid-fast bacilli in the histopathologic specimen. We recommend PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis to be done when granuloma or caseation is detected on biopsy in patients who are suspected of having gastric malignancy or acid peptic diseases.  2013 Moghadam et al."

Throughout the course of HIV infection, the risk of acquisition, reactivation, and reinfection of TB keeps increasing substantially as the immune deficiency progresses. TB coinfected patients inadvertently facilitate HIV infection by release of the proinflammatory cytokines and overexpression of coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5; thereby, the progression of each is facilitated. The difficulties in diagnosing active tuberculosis in HIV-infected individuals poses a great challenge that is further complicated by the challenges in identification of latent TB infection, creating a setback to preventive therapy. Furthermore, prescribing antituberculous therapy and antiretroviral therapy together poses several management challenges, including drug interactions, added toxicities, and TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The current approach to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies in TB and HIV coinfected individuals, along with epidemiology and overview of pathogenetic interplay of both microbes, is reviewed here.  2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York."

Methods: A standardized survey was completed by International epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS paediatric cohort sites in the regions of Asia-Pacific (AP), Central Africa (CA), East Africa (EA), Southern Africa (SA) and West Africa (WA) to understand operational resource availability and paediatric management practices. Data were collected through January 2010 using a secure, web-based software program (REDCap). Results: A total of 64,552 children were under care at 63 clinics (AP, N =10; CA, N =4; EA, N =29; SA, N =10; WA, N =10). Most were in urban settings (N =41, 65%) and received funding from governments (N =51, 81%), PEPFAR (N =34, 54%), and/or the Global Fund (N =15, 24%). The majority were combined adult-paediatric clinics (N =36, 57%). Prevention of mother-to-child transmission was integrated at 35 (56%) sites; 89% (N =56) had access to DNA PCR for infant diagnosis. African (N =40/53) but not Asian sites recommended exclusive breastfeeding up until 4-6 months. Regular laboratory monitoring included CD4 (N =60, 95%), and viral load (N =24, 38%). Although 42 (67%) sites had the ability to conduct acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears, 23 (37%) sites could conduct AFB cultures and 18 (29%) sites could conduct tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing. Loss to follow-up was defined as >3 months of lost contact for 25 (40%) sites, >6 months for 27 sites (43%) and >12 months for 6 sites (10%). Telephone calls (N =52, 83%) and outreach worker home visits to trace children lost to follow-up (N =45, 71%) were common. Conclusions: In general, there was a high level of patient and laboratory monitoring within this multiregional paediatric cohort consortium that will facilitate detailed observational research studies. Practices will continue to be monitored as the WHO/UNAIDS Treatment 2.0 framework is implemented.  2013 IeDEA Pediatric Working Group; licensee International AIDS Society."

Ninety days after a screening test that identified 21 cows as skin test positive, a Comparative Intradermal Tuberculin Test (CITT) was performed in those 21 cows and in 29 other randomly selected skin test negative cows. Milk samples and nasal swabs were collected prior to the CITT for bacteriological culture and PCR, while blood samples were collected for IFN release and antibody responses to MPB70 and MPB83, at three time points post tuberculin injection. Animals positive by CITT were slaughtered and disease confirmation undertaken. Based on the Kappa test, IFN was comparable to the standard tests (culture, PCR and CITT) at all three sampling points. Results from both antibody ELI-SAs were similar but were not comparable to the standard tests. T-test analysis of the CITT, IFN and ELISAs demonstrated that their performances were not correlated. There is increasing recognition that individually, available diagnostic tests do not detect all infected cattle. Therefore, a comprehensive strategy for the diagnosis of bovine TB should include test results for the detection of both cellular and humoral immune responses where there may be animals at different stages of infection."

Future diagnosis requires near-patient tests and early recognition of drug-resistant (DR) TB. Nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAAT) can detect approximately 100 bacilli?mL-1 and have moved from the laboratory into the field. Sensitivity can be improved by detecting proteins, using mass spectrometry, and their function, using reporter enzymes. Ultimately, microfluidics will permit reactions in restricted spaces with the potential to measure single molecules or sequence strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis directly. Metabolic products released by TB and the human response to infection can be described by a characteristic metabolome and volatome of exhaled air. Interferon- release assays (IGRA) are blood tests that indicate the immune response to the few bacilli responsible for latent TB infection (LTBI). Their sensitivity may be improved by cytokines released by activated macrophages (inducible protein-10). The pattern of the immune response to many or all TB antigens, the immunome, may in future distinguish between active disease and latent infection.  ERS 2012."

Due to the invasive risky procedure and technical expertise required in the classical parasitological diagnosis, the goal of the VL experts has been to develop noninvasive procedure(s) applicable in the field settings. Several serological and molecular biological approaches have been developed over the last decades, but only a few are applicable in field settings that can be performed with relative ease. Recently, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has emerged as a novel nucleic acid amplification method for diagnosis of VL. In this study, we have evaluated the LAMP assay using buffy coat DNA samples from VL patients in Bangladesh and compared its performance with leishmania nested PCR (Ln-PCR), an established molecular method with very high diagnostic indices. Methods. Seventy five (75) parasitologically confirmed VL patients by spleen smear microcopy and 101 controls (endemic healthy controls -25, non-endemic healthy control-26, Tuberculosis-25 and other diseases-25) were enrolled in this study. LAMP assay was carried out using a set of four primers targeting L. donovani kinetoplast minicircle DNA under isothermal (62 C) conditions in a heat block. For Ln-PCR, we used primers targeting the parasite's small-subunit rRNA region. Results: LAMP assay was found to be positive in 68 of 75 confirmed VL cases, and revealed its diagnostic sensitivity of 90.7% (95.84-81.14, 95% CI), whereas all controls were negative by LAMP assay, indicating a specificity of 100% (100-95.43, 95% CI). The Ln-PCR yielded a sensitivity of 96% (98.96-87.97, 95% CI) and a specificity of 100% (100-95.43, 95% CI). Conclusion: High diagnostic sensitivity and excellent specificity were observed in this first report of LAMP diagnostic evaluation from Bangladesh. Considering its many fold advantages over conventional PCR and potential to be used as a simple and rapid test in the VL endemic areas of the Indian subcontinent, our findings are encouraging, but further evaluation of LAMP is needed.  2012 Khan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

It has evolved into a simple and rapid, easy- to- use approach. At present there are no published guidelines for the usage of PCR technology for the diagnosis of infections of the nervous system. Methods: We reviewed the advantages and pitfalls of PCR in order to guide neurologists and infectious diseases experts in its application for the diagnosis of infections of the nervous system. Medical reference systems were searched, and original papers, meta-analyses, review papers, book chapters and guidelines recommendations were reviewed. The final literature search was performed in May 2012. Recommendations were reached by consensus. Recommendations: The reliability of PCR technology for the diagnosis of neurological infections is currently based on the pathogens. The main contribution of PCR is to the diagnosis of viral infections followed by bacterial CNS infections with the notable exception of tuberculous meningitis. Efficacy for the diagnosis of protozoal infections and helminthic infestations has also been established in many instances. Unfortunately, current molecular PCR technology is far from becoming routine in resource-poor countries where such infections are prevalent. Despite the importance of fungal infections in the context of the immune-compromised host, there is not enough data to recommend the routine use of PCR. Conclusions: PCR technology is currently a reliable method for the diagnosis of viral and bacterial (except tuberculosis) infections, and only for some protozoal infections and helminthic infestations.  2012 EFNS."

Influenza is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory tract. In Indonesia, numerous number of Avian-Influenza (H5N1) cases occurred in rural area, such as cases in Garut, Jawa Barat in 2006 which started in Cikelet district causing 14 infected-cases and 5 death-cases and has put Garut in an emergency situation until 2010. The H5N1 detection in rural area requires fast yet accurate diagnosis result to enable immediate curative actions. The most accurate result is provided by RT-PCR (Reverse-Transcription Polymerase-Chain-Reaction), which is high investment, and usually locates in urban area. Another diagnostic tool, rapid diagnostic test, is most common tool but gives inaccurate result because of its low sensitivity and specificity. In case of Tuberculosis, Indonesia ranks number 3, after India and China, as a country with most number of infected-people. Symptoms are chronic-cough with blood-tinged-sputum, fever, night-sweats and weight-loss. Tuberculosis is diagnosed by identifying Mycobacterium-tuberculosis organism in clinical sample. When this is not possible, probable diagnosis may be made using imaging X-rays or scans, tuberculin skin test and/or Interferon-Gamma-Release-Assay (IGRA). The main problem with tuberculosis diagnosis is difficulty in culturing this slow-growing organism in laboratory, which may take 4 to 12 weeks for blood or sputum-culture. The requirement is to create a first-hand diagnostic tool which allows paramedic mobility to rural areas for Influenza/Tuberculosis diagnostic purposes. The study first introduces lung auscultation method, then analysis and preliminary design of lung diseases diagnosis software. To enable each Lung Health for Public Council (Balai Besar Kesehatan Paru Masyarakat) and Health Service Office (Dinas Kesehatan) within province/region/country as data owner to maintain its own data, and to provide the data confidentiality as well, the cloud computing environment is then applied.  2012 IEEE."

Study Design: Observational study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from January 2001 to December 2010. Methodology: Different clinical specimens received for Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR were dealt during the study period. Contaminated samples like sputum were processed by the standard N-acetyl L-cysteine (NALC)-NaOH method. PCR protocols were followed as per manufacturer's manual. PCR was performed using a Thermal Cycler (Master Cycler, Eppendorf, Germany): an initial denaturation step at 94C for 3 minutes was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94C for 30 seconds, annealing at 60C for 30 seconds and extension at 72C for 30 seconds and a final extension at 72C for 7 minutes. The products were held at 4C and later run on 1% agarose gel, stained with Ethidium bromide and visualized in ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator. Results: Out of a total 4620 samples for PCR, 299 were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6.5%). The percentage of samples from male patients were 63.2%. The mean age of patients was 38+11.5 years. Blood was the most frequent specimen received for PCR (46.66%), followed by body fluids (18.41%) and CSF (10.64%). Yield for different clinical samples was 63/471 for sputum (13.4%), 3/29 for endobronchial washings (10.3%), 59/851 for body fluids (6.9%) and 24/400 for urine (6%). Positive yield from blood was the lowest (101/2156, 4.7%). Conclusion: PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The highest positive yield was obtained from sputum and lowest from blood specimens."

Diagnosis can be done by imaging techniques, direct visualization by endoscopy, serology, histopathology, culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Laparoscopy detects macroscopic changes only; histology is only suggestive and not confirmatory unless acid fast bacilli (AFB) are demonstrated in the lesion but sensitivity is poor in paucibacillary disease. Culture methods are the gold standard but slow growth of most pathogenic mycobacteria delays the diagnosis. PCR can rapidly detect even few copies of DNA with high sensitivity and specificity. Aim: Comparative evaluation of AFB smear examination, culture in Middlebrook 7H9 media and IS6110 based real-time PCR assay for the detection of mycobacteria in various female genital samples. Materials and methods: A total of 555 female genital samples like endometrial and fallopian tube biopsies, menstrual blood and vaginal discharge were processed by modified Petroff's method. The deposit was used for detection of mycobacteria by AFB smear, culture on Middlebrook 7H9 media and IS6110 based real-time PCR. Results: Out of 555 samples, 25.22% (140/555) were positive by the combination of all the methods used. Overall positivity by real-time PCR alone was 23.78% (132/555), by culture 8.28% (46/555) and 2.70% (15/555) by AFB smear examination. Out of total positives, 94.28% (132/140) were positive by PCR alone, 32.85% (46/140) by culture and 10.71% (15/140) by AFB smear. Eight (5.71%) culture positive samples were negative by smear and PCR, six of these were nontubercular mycobacteria (NTM) and two samples had PCR inhibitors as confirmed by spiking with positive DNA. Contamination was observed in 25/555 (4.5%) which were reported negative by culture but three of these were PCR positive. AFB smear results were available in 1 hour, PCR in 1 day and culture in 4 to 6 weeks. Conclusion: PCR was found to be the most rapid and sensitive (94.28%) method, 9-fold more sensitive than smear examination and 3-fold than the culture for detection of mycobacteria. Results were available in 4 to 6 weeks time for culture but in only 1 day by PCR. IS6110 PCR can detect only MTB and not the NTM. Use of multiplex PCR with genus and MTB specific primers will increase the sensitivity of test but care needs to be taken to prevent false positivity due to cross contamination and false negative due to PCR inhibitors."

Diagnoses of definite PCP, probable PCP, pneumonia with P. jirovecii colonization (colonization) and pneumonia without colonization (non-colonization) were made in 11, 42, 15 and 60 patients, respectively. A PCP diagnosis was undetermined in 19 patients. The copy numbers, determined using qPCR, were significantly higher in definite PCP and probable PCP patients than in colonized patients. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity for discriminating definite PCP from colonization were 0.96, 100.0% and 80.0%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 1300copies/mL. The values for discriminating probable PCP from colonization were 0.71, 66.7% and 73.3%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 340copies/mL. -d-glucan levels were significantly higher in patients with both definite PCP and probable PCP than in colonized patients. The AUC, sensitivity and specificity for discriminating definite PCP were 0.91, 100.0% and 80.0%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 15.6pg/mL. The values for discriminating probable PCP were 0.78, 76.2% and 73.3%, respectively, at a cut-off value of 6.0pg/mL.

Material and methods: Detailed examination was performed in 111 HIV-infected patients with suggested diagnosis of PP. The following investigations were made: clinical, x-ray examinations, total count and biochemical blood tests, enzyme immunoassay, indirect immunofluorescence reaction (II-FR) for Pneumocystis jiroveci antigens in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or induced sputum. For diagnosis of other secondary diseases PCR was used for investigation of BALF and bronchial biopsy to detect DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Candida albicans, Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Mycoplasma spa., Herpes simplex I, II. DNA of cytomegalovirus in blood was detected with PCR. Microscopic tests of the sputum were conducted for detection of acid-resistant mycobacteria. Results: PP was associated with other secondary diseases in 59% patients (pulmonary tuberculosis - 16%, CMV pneumonia - 31%, combination of all the lesions - 5%). PP diagnosis was cancelled and pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 12 patients. In combination of PP with other pathology dominant were symptoms observed in PP monoinfection and only effective anti-pneumocystic treatment revealed signs of comorbid pathology. Tuberculosis patients had weaker signs of respiratory failure, symmetric bilateral interstitial or small-focal alterations were detected less frequently. Conclusion: Current PP course characteristics in HIV infection are identified. In clinical diagnosis of PP special attention should be paid to data complex especially to increasing respiratory failure, high ESR, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low blood p O2, fast response to ex juvantibus therapy. The most effective method of the diagnosis verification - BALF IIFR."

In this report, a case with end stage renal failure as an unexpected late extrapulmonary sequela of tuberculosis has been presented. A 60 years old female patient was admitted to hospital with the complaints of fever, malaise and nausea. Her history revealed that she had pulmonary tuberculosis 30 years ago and received antituberculosis therapy for nine months. The laboratory results on admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 90 mg/dl, serum creatinine 9 mg/dl, sodium 116 mEq/L, potassium 6.6 mEq/L, albumine 2.9 g/dl, hemoglobin, 8.4 g/dl, white blood cell count 10.800/mm3, C-reactive protein 187 mg/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 110 mm/hour. Urinalysis showed 8.1 g/L protein, 10-12 leukocytes, 1-2 erythrocytes, while 24-hours urinalysis yielded proteinuria with 8 ml/minutes creatinine clearance value. Urine and blood cultures of the patient revealed neither bacteria or mycobacteria. PPD skin test was negative. Acid-resistant bacilli (ARB) were not detected in sequential urine samples obtained on three consecutive days. Since sputum samples could not be obtained, diagnostic procedures for sputum were not performed. Abdomen ultrasonography yielded bilateral edema and grade II echogenity in kidneys. Computed tomography of the chest showed bilateral pulmonary nodules, chronic sequela lesions, pleural scarring and calcifications, as well as minimal interstitial infiltrate. Transthoracic lung biopsy showed chronic inflammation and fibrosis, while amyloid was negative. Renal biopsy showed GTN with central caseified necrosis and granulomas, multinuclear giant cells, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Amyloid was negative and ARB were not detected in renal biopsy sample. Definitive diagnosis was achieved by the demonstration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis nucleic acid in kidney biopsy by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antituberculosis therapy was not initiated since there were no signs of active tuberculosis. The patient became clinically stable following dialysis and was discharged, however, she has been undergoing hemodialysis three times a week. The aim of this case presentation was to emphasize that renal tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with end stage renal failure, especially in countries like Turkey where tuberculosis incidence is high."

Extrapulmonary involvement can occur in isolation or along with a pulmonary focus as in the case of patients with disseminated tuberculosis. Tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. TBM a medical emergency, is still a major cause of serious illness in many parts of the world. TBM remains difficult to diagnose, and it is usually due to hematogenous dissemination of the tubercle bacillus. The exact incidence and prevalence are not known. The clinical spectrum is broad and may be non-specific making early diagnosis difficult. Improved outcome requires early recognition and treatment of these conditions. Clinical features included fever for more than 7 days, headache, or neck stiffness. While TBM is a disease of childhood, tuberculomas and spinal tuberculosis are invariably an adult manifestation. In HIV infection, TB is often atypical in presentation, frequently causing extrapulmonary disease, and patients have a high incidence of TBM. Clinical response to antituberculous therapy in all forms of neurotuberculosis is excellent if the diagnosis is made early before irreversible neurological deficit is established. Diagnosis is based on the characteristic clinical picture, neuroimaging abnormalities, cerebrospinal fluid changes and the response to anti-tuberculosis drugs. Diagnosis is best made with lumbar puncture and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Suspect TBM if there is a CSF leucocytosis (predominantly lymphocytes), the CSF protein is raised, and the CSF plasma glucose is <50%. Rapid techniques based on nucleic acid amplification such as PCR are more sensitive and specific as they attempt to detect specific DNA sequences of the organism. The hallmark pathological processes are meningeal inflammation, basal exudates, vasculitis and hydrocephalus. Treatment delay is strongly associated with death and empirical anti-tuberculosis therapy should be started promptly in all patients in whom the diagnosis of TBM is suspected. Corticosteroids reduce the number of deaths. Development of an effective vaccine against tuberculosis hinges on an improved understanding of the human immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis poses a serious threat to the control of this pathogen, and the development of drugs that are active against the resistant strains is vital. Further research into the epidemiology, immune mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of TBM is urgently needed."

Subjecting all cases to panel of investigations including AFB staining, AFB culture/sensitivity, PCR, and histopathology on obtaining tissue have been proved more efficacious than resorting to single test. In particular serology alone is not diagnostic. High sensitivity and specificity of PCR and histopathology are found to be most useful diagnostic modalities in studies.

Material/Methods: Pars plana vitrectomy with silicon-oil tamponade was performed on 12 eyes (12 patients) with severe viral retinitis and endogenous endophthalmitis. The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years (range, 18-56 years). Investigations consisted of chest radiography, RT 23, serology (for toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and human immunodeficiency virus), and routine blood tests and urinalysis. Examination of vitreous samples consisted of polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and cultures for fungi and bacteria. The results were analyzed 7 days and 6 months after surgery. Results: Analysis of vitreous samples showed cytomegalovirus in 3 patients, herpes simplex virus in 2, tuberculosis in 2, and Candida albicans in 5. All patients had improvement in visual acuity and severity of clinical signs seven days after surgery and in 10 cases after long-term follow-up. Final visual acuity was compromised by chronic macular edema, postinflammatory macular scarring, optic atrophy, subcapsular cataract formation, and capsular opacification after cataract surgery.

West Nile Virus (WNV), a member of Flaviviridae, is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus that is usually transmitted to humans by the bite of Culicine mosquitoes. Although the majority of the human infections are asymptomatic, WNV may also cause febrile and neuro-invasive diseases. Seroprevalence data from Turkey indicate that WNV activity is present in Central Anatolia. In this study performed at Hacettepe University Hospital, paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 87 adult patients with the preliminary diagnosis of aseptic meningitis/encephalitis of unknown etiology were evaluated retrospectively to identify WNV-related syndromes. Bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial cultures yielded negative results and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Herpes simplex virus nucleic acid tests were also negative for the selected patients. Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)s and indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT)s were employed for WNV IgM and IgG antibody detection (Anti-WNV Virus IgG/IgM EUSA, Anti-WNV Virus IgG/IgM IIFT; Euroimmun, Germany). Additional ELISA/IIFT assays were further performed for WNV antibody reactive samples to identify cross-reactions and/or infections with other flaviviruses and phleboviruses. All WNV antibody positive samples were also evaluated by a WNV real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. WNV IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in %9.2 (8/87) and 3.4% (3/87) of the serum samples, respectively. All IgG reactive samples were negative for IgM. All sera with WNV antibody reactivity (n= 11) and the corresponding CSF samples were negative for viral RNA via RT-PCR. In 5 of the 8 WNV IgM positive subjects, sandfly fever virus IgM antibodies were detected, which was also accompanied by Dengue virus IgM positivity in one sample. In another case, intrathecal antibody synthesis against measles virus was demonstrated. Two cases (2/87; 2.3%) with WNV IgM positivity as the only serologic marker were identified as probable WNV infections and clinical features were discussed.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a benzyl-alcohol g uanidine hydrochloride (DNA extraction) method (GuHClM) on blood samples. DESIGN: GuHClM was evaluated in quantitatively spiked blood samples with M. tuberculosis. We assessed the insertion sequence (IS) 6110 region of M. tuberculosis to evaluate the efficacy of the method. The method was also applied on 102 clinical samples of suspected tuberculosis (TB) individuals and compared with smear microscopy of sputum specimens and the results of cultures. RESULTS: This method reproducibly detected as low as 4-6 bacilli. Of 102 clinical samples, 84 were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative, while 18 were HIV-positive. Among the HIV-negative individuals, 58.3% were TB-positive using PCR, while respectively 47.6% and 45.2% were sputum- and culture-positive. Among the HIV-positive individuals, 55.6% were PCR-positive, whereas only 38.9% were sputum-positive and 50% were culture-positive.

Material and Methods: Fifty-one meningitis/meningoencephalitis cases followed in our clinic between April 2003 and May 2008 were evaluated retrospectively. Demographic characteristics and clinical data of the patients were obtained from the records. Diagnosis of meningitis/meningoencephalitis depended on cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) and radiological findings in the presence of clinical findings. Results: Among 51 patients, 29 (56.9%) were diagnosed as acute bacterial meningitis, 12 (23.5%) as viral meningoencephalitis and 10 (19.6%) as tuberculosis meningitis. Classical findings of meningitis such as fever, neck stiffness and change in conciuosness were present in 69% of the cases with acute bacterial meningitis, in 50% of the ones with viral meningitis, and in 40% of the ones with tuberculosis meningitis. Blood white blood cell count was 19.308/mm3 in acute bacterial meningitis, 10.389/mm3 in viral meningitis, and 9980/mm3 in tuberculosis meningitis. Increased blood white blood cell count was statistically significant in acute bacterial meningitis (p&lt; 0.05). CSF white blood cell count was 4254.0/mm3 in acute bacterial meningitis, 282.5/mm3 in viral meningitis, and 365/ mm3 in tuberculosis meningitis. Causative pathogen was isolated in 15 (51.7%) of the 29 cases with acute bacterial meningitis; it was Streptococcus pneumoniae in 10 (34.4%), Listeria monocytogenes in 3 (10.34%), Staphylococcus aureus in 1 (3.4%), and Streptococcus pyogenes in one (3.4%) patient. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in CSF culture in 2 (20%) of the 10 patients with tuberculosis meningitis. CSF was positive for HSV-DNA with PCR in two of 12 patients with viral meningoencephalitis. Mean period of hospitalization was 17.76 days in patients with community acquired meningitis/meningoencephalitis; this period was significantly longer in the tuberculosis meningitis cases (p&lt; 0.05). Mean cost of hospitalization and medication was 4860.95 USD for the cases with community acquired meningitis/meningoencephalitis. No mortality was seen in the cases with viral meningoencephalitis, whereas case fatality rate was 37.9% (11/29) in acute bacterial meningitis and 10% (1/10) in tuberculosis meningitis. Three cases with viral meningoencephalitis, two cases with acute bacterial meningitis and two cases with tuberculosis meningitis healed with sequelae. Conclusion: Despite developments in medicine, cases with meningitis/meningoencephalitis require prolonged hospitalization, have high fatality rate and cost, and the disease leads to serious sequelae.  2010 by Trkiye Klinikleri."

It is characterized by a complex mixture of mycobacteria antigens able to induce hypersensitivity reactions even in animals infected with mycobacteria other than M. bovis, for purposes of cross-reactivity. The preparation of purified protein derivative (PPD) is similar to the tuberculin, unlike the concentration of proteins which are separated by precipitation with chemical agents and not by increasing its specific heat. The first results obtained with the serological tests for diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis show that there is a great antigenic cross-reactivity between mycobacterias species so it requires more specific antigens. It implemented a cattle IFN- test and ELISA-TBC to detect anti M. bovis activity. The immunoassay test for IFN- used in conjunction with the cropping system of whole blood resulted in an essay in vitro rapid and sensitive to detect the reactivity of the cell-mediated immunity to M. bovis in livestock infected. Comparative test of the tuberculina, test of Gamma Interferon (INF-) and a test ELISA-TBC, soon was taken to slaughter house to take linfoides weave samples and nodules, to which the test of chain reaction of Polimerasa was applied to them, to bacteriological culture and (PCR), for the identification from the pathogen.

The boy received a BCG vaccination at the age of four months. The patient was diagnosed as having Crohn's disease at the age of six months by intestinal endoscopy. Based on the diagnosis, he was treated with nutrition therapy, salazosulfapyridine, and prednisolone. Fever of unknown origin occurred two months after he had taken azathioprine at the age of two years and two months. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected from a gastric aspirate, and he was diagnosed as having disseminated BCG infection by means of the multiplex PCR method. Chest CT showed miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs on admission. Physical examination revealed enlarged lymphnodes, which were palpable around the neck and groin, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory data were within normal ranges except a slightly increased peripheral white blood cell and serum CRP level. He was treated with rifampicin (15 mg/kg/day), isoniazid (15 mg/kg/day) for 12 months, and streptomycin (25 mg/kg/day) for two months. He became afebrile a week after starting the treatment, and the miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs had disappeared by 5 months after starting the treatment. An abnormality of the NEMO gene, which is the gene responsible for ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency, was identified at the age of three years. It is assumed that an abnormality of the NEMO gene caused a latent BCG infection over a period of one year and ten months, and immunosuppressive medicine (azathioprine) induced a disseminated BCG infection. This case report supports that anti-tuberculosis medicine should be given to prevent disseminated BCG infection if an infant who receive immunosuppressive therapy is found to have an immune deficiency characterized by a mycobacterium infection after BCG vaccination."

The patient had already undergone several antibiotic therapies that had not changed the X-graphic framework. On presentation, routine blood tests and cultural examinations of sputum were carried out to detect common germs, fungi and TB bacteria (microscopic observation, cultivation and PCR), and a new antibiotic therapy (piperacillin/tazobactam) was started. Since the radiological picture appeared unchanged after 10 days of therapy and the examinations (microscopic observation and PCR) were negative, bronchoscopy with bacteriological evaluation of BAL was performed, which was positive to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and then tubercular lobitis was diagnosed. Therefore a specific therapy - rifampin (RMP), isoniazid (INH), etambutol (EMB), pyrazinamid (PZA) - was started and changed after 10 days due to the growth of mycobacteria resistant to INH and EMB on examination of sputum. Consequently, the early use of PCR on BAL allows, in skilled hands, small aspecific lobitis to be diagnosed more rapidly than using cultural examination of sputum."

TB can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract, and intestinal TB is an important disease of extra-pulmonary TB. The diagnosis of intestinal TB remains a challenge because the signs and symptoms are nonspecific. It should be differentiated from the inflammatory bowel diseases and malignancies, especially Crohn's disease. The diagnosis of intestinal TB should be based on careful clinical evaluation, such as extra-intestinal signs, colonoscopic and histologic evaluation. Newer techniques such as PCR method or test for the diagnosis of latent TB (Interferon-gamma assay) may be helpful. In addition, a high index of suspicion must be kept in mind to ensure a timely diagnosis. Herein, IBD Study Group of the KASID proposes a diagnostic guideline based on currently available evidence and experience, especially those of Korea.

Differential diagnosis is important because diseases caused by other aetiologies and a clinical spectrum similar to that of leishmaniasis (e.g. leprosy, skin cancers and tuberculosis for CL; malaria and schistosomiasis for VL) are often present in endemic areas of endemicity. Presently, a variety of methods have been developed and tested to aid the identification and diagnosis of Leishmania. The advent of the PCR technology has opened new channels for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis in a variety of clinical materials. PCR is a simple, rapid procedure that has been adapted for diagnosis of leishmaniasis. A range of tools is currently available for the diagnosis and identification of leishmaniasis and Leishmania species, respectively. However, none of these diagnostic tools are examined and tested using samples spotted on FTA cards. Three different PCR-based approaches were examined including: kDNA minicircle, Leishmania 18S rRNA gene and PCR-RFLP of Intergenic region of ribosomal protein. PCR primers were designed that sit within the coding sequences of genes (relatively well conserved) but which amplify across the intervening intergenic sequence (relatively variable). These were used in PCR-RFLP on reference isolates of 10 of the most important Leishmania species: L. donovani, L. infantum, L. major & L. tropica. Digestion of PCR products with restriction enzymes produced species-specific restriction patterns allowed discrimination of reference isolates. The kDNA minicircle primers are highly sensitive in diagnosis of both bone marrow and skin smears from FTA cards. Leishmania 18S rRNA gene conserved region is sensitive in identification of bone marrow smear but less sensitive in diagnosing skin smears. The intergenic nested PCR-RFLP using P5 & P6 as well as P1 & P2 newly designed primers showed high level of reproducibility and sensitivity. Though, it was less sensitive than kDNA minicircle primers, but easily discriminated between Leishmania species."

In 1993, the World Health Organization declared tuberculosis a global public health emergency. Conventional methods for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections are time consuming, as MTB culture requires 3-8 weeks for growth. To determine the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), we have evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in adults with new cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. Setting: Department of Infectious disease of Imam Khomeini Hospital, 2004-2005, Tehran, Iran. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated MTB DNA extracted from 3ml citrated peripheral blood samples from 95 adults with new cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. DNA extraction was performed using a commercial PCR kit with IS1081 primers. For prevention of cross contamination and reduction of false positives, all steps were performed under laminar hood. Results: The 95 patients, 59 of whom were male, had a mean age 44.44 years (SD20.26); 69 cases had pulmonary and 26 had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. PCR was positive in 32 (33.7%) patients and negative in 63 (66.3%) cases. The overall sensitivity and accuracy of the PCR assay was 44.1% for pulmonary, 19.2% for extra-pulmonary and 10% for disseminated tuberculosis, respectively. Conclusion: The low sensitivity of the IS1081 primer MTB-PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, further studies are needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis."

We simultaneously detected anti-mycobacterium bovis BCG IgG secreting cells in both cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood (PBL) by enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT), repeated insertion sequence IS6110 specific for mycobacterium tuberculosis in CSF by PCR and anti-BCG IgG titre in both CSF and PBL by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The sensitivity of ELISPOT was 84.0%, much higher than that of PCR (75.0%) and ELISA (52.3%). The specificities of the three tests were 91.8%, 93.7% and 91.8% respectively. The numbers of CSF cells secreting anti-BCG IgG tested by ELISPOT were even higher in the early phase of TBM, but declined along with the disease progressing (t = -3.183, P = 0.008), which allowed an early diagnosis to be made. Conclusion: ELISPOT technique is proved to be the most valuable test for the early diagnosis of TBM."

Among the most serious are fungal infections which are often life-threatening, and difficult to recognize and treat. We present a patient with severe pneumonia and pleural effusion, that developed during treatment of a soft tissue sarcoma with pulmonary metastases. CASE REPORT: A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the ITU because of marked dyspnoea, bilateral pneumonia and pleural effusion. She was intubated and placed on a ventilator, and bilateral pleural drains were inserted. She also required vigorous inotropic support (dopamine + noradrenaline). CRP was 12.5-19.8 mg dL(-1) and procalcitonin was below 1 ng mL(-1)). Lung metastases and tuberculosis were excluded and fungal infection suspected. Aspergillus DNA was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage, and in blood serum (PCR). Amphotericin B and voriconazole were instituted, but without evident success, The girl was severely distressed, required mechanical ventilation with an F1O2 of 0.6, while her CRP increased to 28.4 mg dL(-1). The amphotericin was stopped and replaced with caspofungin, resulting in rapid improvement in her clinical status. The girl was extubated after 21 days of ventilation, however due to a very severe opioid withdrawal syndrome with extreme agitation, she was re-intubated. After a further two weeks on methadone and sedatives, she was extubated again, this time successfully, One month later she was discharged from the hospital, still on oral voriconazole. CONCLUSION: Fungal infection should always be considered in immunocompromised patients with clinical signs of systemic infection. Recognition and treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult and may require multi drug therapy."

The total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood leucocytes cultured with PHA mitogen stimulation. Then bovine IFN- (BovIFN-) gene cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pET28a to obtain the expression plasmid designated as pETBovIFN-. The pETBovIFN- was further transformed into competent E. coli BL21 cells and a 18kD His-tagged protein as expected was expressed after IPTG induction. By using purified recombinant BovIFN- as antigen and lymphocyte-hybridoma technique, four hybridoma cell lines which stably secreted monoclonal antibodies against rBovIFN- were generated, designated as A7, A10, G6, and G10. The immunoglobin subset was identified as IgG1. Western-blotting analysis and ELISA demonstrated that the monoclonal antibodies secreted by all the four hybridoma cell lines could react specifically to the recombinant BovIFN-, but not irrelative proteins such as Ag85B, ESAT-6-CFP-10 and GM-CSF, suggesting that the four hybridoma cell lines were rBovIFN- specific monoclonal antibodies. A sandwich ELISA was established by using A10 secreted monoclonal antibody and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against BovIFN-, HRP labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. The results indicated that the sensitivity was 2ng/mL. This sandwich ELISA to detect BovIFN- paved the way to develop a sensitive method for specific infection detection such as bovine tuberculosis diagnosis."

He was admitted to our hospital with the presumptive diagnosis of septic shock due to miliary tuberculosis, which was confirmed with sputum PCR of tuberculosis later. He was initiated on mechanical ventilation and was started empirically on anti-tuberculosis antibiotics, meropenem, and vancomycin immediately. Hydrocortisone was started for adrenal insufficiency secondary to chronic steroid treatment. For his septic shock, he was given normal saline bolus and norepinephrine infusion with central venous pressure and systemic blood pressure monitoring. On the second hospital day, his blood pressure was decreased to 50/20mmHg on norepinephrine 25g/min. Then, we started continuous administration of vasopressin 0.04 units/minute for norepinephrine resistant septic shock. His BP went up to 100/50mmHg. His norepinephrine and vasopressin were successfully tapered off on the 4 th day and 5 th day, respectively. The mechanical ventilation was successfully weaned off on the 10 th day. Vasopressin level is elevated in the early phase of septic shock, but it is decreased to normal range with continued shock. This relative vasopressin deficiency has been reported to be one of the causes of refractory septic shock. Moreover, low dose of vasopressin has been demonstrated to be effective in raising the blood pressure. We reported a case of refractory septic shock which was successfully treated with low dose vasopressin. Low dose of vasopressin might be a useful salvage treatment for patients with refractory septic shock."

Cerebrospinal fluid culture was negative for fungi and bacteria, including mycobacterium tuberculosis. Negative results for PCR and ELISA made herpes simplex virus encephalitis unlikely. We treated him empirically with aciclovir and cefpirome, conducting further tests because a HIV serological test was positive on admission. HIV RNA was 2.9  10 5 copies/m/ in the blood. Western blot analysis demonstrated positive bands at gp160, p24, p55, and p68, but negative at gp120, p52, gp41, p40, p34, and p18. These results yielded a definitive diagnosis of acute primary HIV infection presenting as meningoencephalitis. His clinical condition improved over the next few days. Repeated MRI showed a new lesion in the pons on T2-weighted images. No MRI abnormality has reported previously in acute primary HIV infection with meningoencephalitis. High signal intensity in the bilateral globus pallidus and the pons in patients with meningoencephalitis may thus be a useful indicator for acute primary HIV infection."

Their pathogenesis and relationship to ""true"" tuberculids are poorly understood. This report presents a case of a 6-month-old girl who developed generalized papulonecrotic tuberculid-like eruptions after BCG vaccination. The skin lesions healed spontaneously in 3 months. Culture of blood, gastric juice and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of papulonecrotic skin biopsies were all negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Histopathology of papulonecrotic eruptions revealed marked epidermal necrosis, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and epidermotropic infiltration of lymphocytes showing markers of CD3+ lymphocytes (90-95% of all infiltrating cells), CD4+ (40-50%), CD8+ (40-50%), and CD45RO+ (70%). In contrast, the BCG vaccination site revealed intradermal granuloma with epithelioid cells, occasional giant cells and infiltration of lymphocytes consisting of CD3+ (60-70%), CD4+ (40-50%), CD8 + (30-40%), CD45RO+ (40%), CD79a+ (30-40%), and CD20+ (20-30%). Our patient did not reveal any signs indicative of tuberculosis. Papulonecrotic lesions were therefore called papulonecrotic tuberculid-like eruptions, rather than tuberculids, that occurred after BCG vaccination and appeared to derive from a hypersensitive reaction mediated by immune lymphocytic infiltration.  2007 Japanese Dermatological Association."

Subjects: Fifty two sequential patients were enrolled. Thirty patients with FNAC diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis and positive PCR for M. tuberculosis complex had a mean age of 26.911.2 years and similar male, female affection. Nine patients with FNAC tuberculous lymphadenitis, but negative PCR had a slightly higher mean age (32.618.2 years) with similar male : female proportions. Patients with reactive lymphadenopathy (9/52) were older than patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis with a mean age of 4524.6 years. Results: None of the patients were positive for HIV or had clinical or radiological evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis.

In the present study, diagnostic methods based on mycobacterial DNA amplification were evaluated in comparative trials alongside tradicional bacterial methods, using negative smear samples from patients with clinically-suspected TB (sputum samples from 25 patients with suspected pulmonary TB, urine samples from two patients with suspected renal TB and cerebrospinal fluid samples from one patient with suspected meningeal TB). A specificity of 100% was achieved with DNA amplification methods and tradicional culture/identification methods, in relation to clinical findings and treatment results. For the smear-negative sputa, conventional PCR for M. tuberculosis was positive in 62% of suspected lung TB case, showing the same sensitivity as bacterial identification. Both techniques failed in the detection of extra-pulmonary samples. Nested PCR showed, after species-specific amplification, a sensitivity of 100% for M. avium and 85% for M. tuberculosis. For extra-pulmonary smear-negative samples, only Nested PCR detected M. tuberculosis and all cases were confirmed clinically.

By using nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, one may be able to diagnose, the disease on the day of arrival of specimen in the laboratory. For diagnosis of tuberculosis by direct methods like PCR, specimens from site of infection are required. In certain cases it is difficult to get the specimens from site of infection and in such situations; some researchers have tried to detect the DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from blood of these patients. The purposive of this study is to determine the diagnostic efficacy of peripheral blood-based polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: This was a simple descriptive study, carried out in Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi from Jan 2004 to Dec 2004. Sputum and blood samples were collected from 96 suspected patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum samples processed for ZN staining and AFB culture (gold standard) and blood samples processed for PCR. RESULTS: Out of 96 cases, 60 (62.5%) were culture positive. PCR was positive in 14 (14.5%). AFB smear positive were 34 (35.4%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 20% and 94.4% respectively and the positive and negative predictive values were 85.71% and 41.46% respectively. The overall efficiency of the test was 47.91%. CONCLUSION: Due to low sensitivity; a negative PCR assay does not rule the disease. However, this test may be helpful in cases where specimens from the site of infection are not available."

DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. METHOD: Seven hundred and fifty children with suspected TB were evaluated clinically, by chest radiography and by tuberculin test (Mantoux). Probable cases underwent sputum induction or lymph node biopsy, HIV testing and RNA-PCR tests. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The Mantoux test was positive in 55/121 (45%) of the patients; low sensitivity to Mantoux was associated with HIV infection (P = 0.000). Induced sputum yielded 12/101 (12%) positive smears of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 30/101 (30%) positive cultures. Six of the eight lymph node biopsies were culture-positive, and the histology of seven samples was supportive of TB. Most of the children with probable and confirmed TB presented with similar signs, symptoms and chest radiography patterns, irrespective of HIV status.

Wide-spread use of nucleic acid amplification for rapid detection of tubercle bacillus contributed more greatly than any other factor to such advances in this field. At present, 90% of all kits used for nucleic acid amplification in the world are consumed in Japan. Unfortunately, not a few clinicians in Japan have a false idea that the smear method and nucleic acid amplification are necessary but culture is not. In any event nucleic acid amplification has exerted significant impacts on the routine works at bacteriology laboratories. Among others, collecting bacteria by pretreatment with NALC-NaOH has simplified the introduction of the collective mode smear method and liquid media. Furthermore, as clinicians have become increasingly more experienced with various methods of molecular biology, it now seems possible to apply these techniques for detection of genes encoding drug resistance and for utilization of molecular epidemiology in routine laboratory works. Meanwhile, attempts to diagnose acid-fast bacteriosis by checking blood for antibody have also been made, primarily in Japan. At present, two kits for detecting antibodies to glycolipids (LAM, TDM, etc.) are covered by national health insurance in Japan. We have an impression that in Japan clinicians do not have adequate knowledge and skill to make full use of these new testing methods clinically. We, as the chairmen of this symposium, hope that this symposium will help clinicians increase their skill related to new testing methods, eventually leading to stimulation of advances in clinical practices related to acid-fast bacteria in Japan. 1. Smear microscopy by concentration method and broth culture system: Kazunari TSUYUGUCHI (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center) Smear microscopy and culture still remain the cornerstone to diagnose tuberculosis. However, the classical methods in Japan using direct microscopy and Ogawa solid media were not sufficient for clinical use. In recent years substantial advance has been made in these fields. Concentration of clinical samples by centrifugation improves the sensitivity of smear microscopy with excellent reproducibility. The Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) system using liquid media yields high sensitivity and rapidity. Using these methods, more and more tuberculosis cases would be correctly diagnosed and treated adequately based on drug susceptibility testing. 2. New technologies for anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing : Satoshi MITARAI (Bacteriology Division, Reference Centre for Mycobacterium, Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association) Several new technologies have been developed to obtain anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing (AST) results rapidly, utilising liquid culture and molecular technologies. Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT), as a popular liquid culturing and AST system, was evaluated for its accuracy and usefulness. As for isoniazid, MGIT showed 12.6% of discordant result comparing with standard method. These MGIT resistant and Ogawa susceptible strains had relatively high MICs ranging 0.13 to 2.0  g/m/. The molecular detection of resistant gene mutation is also a useful method to estimate drug resistance rapidly. The rpoB mutation detection is reliable with high sensitivity and specificity. 3. Nucleic acid amplification and novel diagnostic methods: Shunji TAKAKURA (Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine) Sensitivities of nucleic acid amplificatiion tests (NAATs) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis meet clinical requirement that patients with high-risk of transmission should be identified within a day. Comparison of the performance of various NAATs is difficult because of the difference in sample processing and in samples tested among methods and reports. Considering the limitations of NAATs (low sensitivity compared with culture, inability to differentiate dead bacilli from the living), further advances would be expected when novel technologies could confer additional imformation, such as drug susceptibility, quantity, viability, and genotype. 4. Serodiagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease : Seigo KITADA (Department of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Toneyama National Hospital) Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) organisms are ubiquitous in environment and a contamination in respiratory tracts is sometimes observed, and that complex the diagnosis. We developed a serodiagnostic method for MAC disease using an enzyme immunoassay with the MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid (GPL) core as antigen. A significant increase in GPL core antibodies was detected in sera of patients with MAC pulmonary diseases compared to patients who were colonized with MAC, patients with M. kansasii disease and tuberculosis and healthy subjects. The serodiagnosis is useful for diagnosis of MAC lung disease. 5. Molecular epidemiologic tools for tuberculosis: IS6110 RFLP, Spoligotyping, and VNTR: Tomoshige MATSUMOTO, Hiromi ANO, Tetsuya TAKASHIMA, Izuo TSUYUGUCHI (Osaka Prefectural Medical Center for Respiratory and Allergic Diseases) We have performed molecular typing on about 1,300 culture positive clinical isolates that made up the majority of tuberculosis strains in part of southeast Osaka since 2001 until now. By spoligotyping, about 75% of entire strains belonged to the Beijing strain. Particular spoligotyping descriptions, which were not described in SpolDBIII, were found in the strains with lower than 6 copies of IS6110 RFLP. We described them as Osaka type. We could also show that direct typing from Tb PCR positive sputum of patients with tuberculosis was possible by VNTR and that VNTR with 16 loci was useful in tuberculosis typing in Osaka."

When a patient with miliary tuberculosis initially presents with ARDS, the mortality is much higher. Therefore, the early detection of miliary tuberculosis as the underlying cause of ARDS is very important for the prognosis and survival of the patient. The diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis may be easy if the patient presents typical clinical manifestations associated with the characteristic pattern of miliary nodules on chest radiology. However, the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis when complicated with ARDS can be difficult due to the nonspecific radiologic patterns, such as diffuse bilateral consolidation and ground glass opacity, without miliary nodular infiltration. However, these nonspecific patterns are known as less likely findings of miliary tuberculosis. We experienced a pregnant woman with miliary tuberculosis, mimicking ARDS due to bilateral severe pneumonia. She was admitted, via the emergency room, with sudden onset of fever, chill, cough and dyspnea. The initial chest PA and HRCT showed diffuse bilateral consolidation and ground glass opacity, without miliary nodular infiltration. All bacteriological studies, including blood and sputum cultures, tuberculosis-PCR and serologic study for infectious disease were negative. However, the definite diagnosis of unusual miliary tuberculosis as the underlying cause of ARDS was confirmed from the radiological finding and transbronchial fiberoptic lung biopsy. We report this case, with a review of the literature."

The patient had a 2 years history of slowly increasing left cervical mass with no significant clinical manifestation. Medical assistance was requested mostly by the family, concerned about the large mass visible on the left side of the patient's neck. Clinical and laboratory investigation revealed: a large left laterocervical tumour and the presence of erythematous, non pruriginous skin lesions. No significant changes were shown by routine blood tests. Thyroid function was in the normal range. Neck ultrasound revealed the presence of a 5/6 cm, well defined hypoechoic mass and the thyroid scan showed no accumulation of the radiotracer in the cervical tumour. Routine tuberculosis test was negative and the patient had no sign of pulmonary involvement. Histopathological examination after ablation of this tumour showed the presence of granulomatous lesions suggesting tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. The same aspect was seen after histopathological examination of the specimens from cutaneous biopsy. The diagnosis was certified by the PCR amplification of the DNA extracted from the skin lesions, which led to the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The cutaneous lesions were clearly improved after tuberculostatic treatment, supporting the hypothesis of a rare form of cutaneous tuberculosis."

The result of M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in sputum, ascitic fluid, CSF and urine samples were found to be similar in both the primers used. It is suggested that, M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in blood samples using MPB64 primers sometime gives false positive result and therefore, may not be recommended for blood samples.

The inadequate sensitivity of Ziehl-Neelsen staining and its inability to distinguish atypical mycobacteria delays accurate diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of TB in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blood and extra-pulmonary samples from patients with AIDS and pulmonary infiltrates. DESIGN: Specimens from 103 HIV-1-infected patients were prospectively analysed using bacteriological methods and IS6110-PCR. Smear-positive samples were also tested using 16S ribosomal-DNA-PCR to identify Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. Gold standard diagnosis relied on positive cultures or treatment outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients exhibited TB, one TB and MAC and four MAC. The sensitivity of IS6110-PCR was 100% in smear-positive samples, 81.8% in smear-negative BAL, 66.7% in extra-pulmonary samples and 42.9% in blood. Its specificity was 97.1% in BAL and 100% in extra-pulmonary and blood specimens. The 16S rDNA-PCR identified M. avium from all smear-positive samples that grew MAC. CONCLUSIONS: IS6110-PCR proved useful in evaluating episodes with probable clinical diagnosis of pulmonary or mixed TB and negative smears, whereas 16S rDNA-PCR would be helpful for prompt differential diagnosis of MAC in smear-positive specimens."

Contact with infected animals, ingestion of contaminated animal products and handling of Brucella isolates in laboratories are risk factors. Various other febrile illnesses, e.g. malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid fever and tularemia may present with the same symptoms. Therefore, clinical diagnosis is difficult to establish but effective therapy requires an early diagnosis. Vaccines for humans are still not commercially available. Blood culturing of Brucella is time-consuming and not reliable. Thus diagnosis is usually based on indirect serological tests, i.e. serum agglutination test, complement fixation or the Coombs test. However, these 'conventional' serological tests lack sensitivity and specificity. Hence, a combination of various tests is mandatory for a definite diagnosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays can be used for screening and confirmation of brucellosis in one step. Molecular techniques like the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism are needed to differentiate species and strains within the genus Brucella. This review will summarize advantages and disadvantages of the techniques used in clinical laboratories for direct detection and identification of Brucella spp."

RESULTS: Of 229 patients, 86% were HIV-positive and 71% had a pathogen identified. TB was confirmed in 52%, 17% had acute mycoplasma pneumonia, 3% had Pneumocystis carinii, 27% grew a bacterial pathogen from sputum and 8% from blood. Ninety-four per cent of TB diagnoses were made through expectorated sputum and only 5% of TB cases were diagnosed by sputum induction alone. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis had positive and negative predictive values of 94% and 59%, respectively. Male sex, cough <2 weeks, and tuberculin skin test 5 mm were independently associated with culture-positive TB among persons with negative acid-fast bacilli smears. Coinfection with two or more pathogens occurred in 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was quite common despite clinical suspicion of TB, and sputum induction and PCR did not significantly improve our ability to diagnose TB, although clinical presentation had some predictive value."

Intracranial localizations, including brain stem tuberculoma, are very rare. The authors report a case of brain tuberculoma in a patient with a history of primary pulmonary tuberculosis successfully treated more than twenty years earlier. The patient presented with signs of infection, although the fever disappeared temporarily after successive treatments for malaria (confirmed Plasmodium falciparum), as well as neurological signs with left hemiparesis. Chest radiographs showed no signs of progressive pulmonary tuberculosis, and blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid testing, and HIV serology were all negative. Treatments for maxillary sinusitis, the malaria, bacterial meningitis, and cerebral abscess were equally ineffective. Brain stem tuberculoma was diagnosed only when the patient was transferred to a hospital equipped with neuroimaging equipment and was confirmed after histopathological examination of the intracranial lesion biopsies and the detection of mycobacterium DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the cerebrospinal fluid. A review of 147 cases of intracranial tuberculoma reported in Africa between 1985 and 2001 points out the difficulties of both the differential diagnosis (tuberculoma or other intracranial space-occupying lesions) and treatment in African areas where neuroimaging is unavailable. Our patient's brainstem tuberculoma probably resulted from reactivation of latent tuberculosis."

Methods: The records of 16 patients (6 male, 10 female; mean age 37 years, range 18-56years) with tuberculosis of the pancreas and peripancreatic lymph nodes from 1983 to 2001 in the Southwest Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. In addition, 58 similar cases published in Chinese literature were reviewed and summarized. We reviewed the clinical, radiographic and laboratory findings, diagnostic methods, therapeutic approaches, and outcome in the patients. Criteria for the diagnosis of pancreatic tuberculosis were the presence of granuloma in histological sections or the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Predominant symptoms consisted of abdominal nodule and pain (75 %), anorexia/weight loss (69 %), malaise/weakness (64 %), fever and night sweats (50 %), back pain (38 %) and jaundice (31 %). Swelling of the head of the pancreas with heterogeneous attenuation echo was detected with ultrasound in 75 % (12/16). CT scan showed pancreatic mass with heterogeneous hypodensity focus in all patients, with calcification in 56 % (9/16) patients, and peripancreatic nodules in 38 % (6/16) patients. Anemia and lymphocytopenia were seen in 50 % (8/16) patients, and pancytopenia occurred in 13 % (2/ 16) patients. Hypertransaminasemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP) and GGT were seen in 56 % (9/16) patients. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 69 % (11/16) cases. Granulomas were found in 75 % (12/16) cases, and in 38 % (6/16) cases caseous necrosis tissue was found. Laparotomy was performed in 75 % (12/16) cases, and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) was done in 63 % (10 of 16). The most commonly used combinations of medications were isoniazid/rifampin/streptomycin (63 %, n=10) and isoniazid/rifampin pyrazinamide/streptomycin or ethambutol (38 %, n=6). The duration of treatment lasted for half or one year and treatment was successful in all cases. The characteristics of 58 cases from Chinese literature were also summarized. Conclusion: Tuberculosis of the pancreas and peripancreatic lymph nodes should be considered as a diagnostic possibility in patients presenting with a pancreatic mass, and diagnosis without laparotomy is possible if only doctors are aware of its clinical features and investigate it with appropriate modalities.

However, have found no published comparisons between these two groups of subjects with hepatic tuberculosis have been found. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, radiologic features and pathological findings of hepatic tuberculosis in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Method: The authors reviewed retrospectively 20 patients with hepatic tuberculosis admitted between January 1993 and October 2000 to Chulalongkorn University Hospital, Thailand. There were 12 immunocompromised patients (10 HIV-infected males, 1 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) male, 1 SLE female) and 8 immunocompetent patients (6 males, 2 females). The clinical manifestations, biochemical tests, radiologic features and pathological findings were compared between these 2 groups. The diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) was the combination of a demonstrated organism in hemo- or specimen culture, histopathology (positive acid fast bacilli) and rapid identification of M. tb from nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assay based on amplification of the IS 6110 insertion sequences. Results: The clinical features were similar in both groups with fever, weight loss and hepatomegaly as the main manifestations. The biochemical findings were also similar but the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was significantly higher in the immunocompromised group (p < 0.001). Hepatomegaly and diffuse increased echogenicity were common in both groups. Ascitis and calcifications were found more commonly in the immunocompetent subjects, although the differences were not statistically significant. Non-caseating granuloma without detection of acid fast bacilli was a common finding in both groups. The nested PCR assay increased the sensitivity from 49 per cent to 86 per cent compared to the regular PCR assay but specificity was 100 per cent in both techniques. The mortality was significantly higher in immunocompetent patients (p < 0.05) due to the extreme age and severe coexisting diseases. Conclusion: Fever, weight loss, hepatomegaly, disproportionate elevation of ALP and reverse A/G ratio were common in hepatic tuberculosis. A disproportionate elevation of ALP was significantly higher in the immunocompromised hosts. Nested PCR assay showed good sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of this disease."

In the last two months, fever had occurred, and persisted with the start of hemodialysis. She was admitted to our nephrology unit. Clinical, laboratory, radiological and endoscopic investigations did not lead to a precise diagnosis and broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy failed. Some days later, a clear clinical picture of acute abdomen arose and at laparatomy a perforated jejunal ulcer was found. Histological investigation revealed caseous necrosis around the ulcer. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain showed a number of acid-fast resistant bacilli. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Specific therapy was started, but nevertheless the patient died a few days later, of septic shock. Our case shows that tuberculosis continues to be a significant, severe clinical problem in transplant recipients and is in fact still an important cause of death in these patients. The possibility of tuberculosis must be taken into account when a transplant patient shows fever and severe abdominal trouble with no clear evidence of another infection."

He was tentatively diagnosed as epilepsy, and was transferred to our hospital. Brain CT demonstrated multiple intracranial lesions, which were homogeneously enhanced. Chest X-ray revealed retiform shadow in the right middle lung field. Pulmonary tuberculosis and intracranial tuberculomas were suspected and bacterial cultures, PCR, smear examination of sputum, blood, CSF, gastric juice, and urine were repeated. But no evidence of tuberculosis was obtained. Follow-up CT after 5 days of admission showed exacerbation of intracranial lesions. Finally, the open brain biopsy was carefully done from the right occipital lesion. The histological examination disclosed a typical pathology of tuberculoma and PCR also turned out to be positive from the brain tissue. We diagnosed him as intracranial tuberculoma and anti-tuberculous drugs (isoniazid, cthambutol, pyrazinamide) were administered. After 30 days under the medication, brain CT demonstrated a transient expansion of the intracranial le-sions. While the same therapy was sustained, intracranial lesions gradually decreased and he discharged after 60 days of admission. Brain CT is known as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of intracranial tuberculoma. Its sensitivity is almost 100%, but some clinical reports have described that its specificity is not always so high(20-71%) as expected. In addition, it should be recognized that intracranial tuberculoma might show 'paradoxical expan-sion'. It is a phenomenon, which shows a paradoxical worsening in clinical aspect despite of the appropriate therapy. In such a progressing case as ours, it is desirable to make a definite diagnosis before anti-tuberculous drug is started. Therefore, it is recommended in possible cases to even consider the open brain biopsy from the early period when intracranial tuberculoma is highly suspected."

CONCLUSION: The use of a nested PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis with regard to low sensitivity and specificity. However, further studies are needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of paucibacillary forms of tuberculosis."

A 34-year-old man from Nigeria who had resided permanently in the Netherlands for five years had experienced fever, upper abdominal pain and weight loss for several months. He did not give the impression of being ill. A CT scan gave cause to suspect pancreatitis. An HIV test gave a positive result. Puncture of the accumulated fluid around the pancreas led to the diagnosis 'tuberculosis' (infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Once the patient had made a good recovery with antituberculosis therapy, antiretroviral therapy was initiated, whereupon the number of CD4- cells in the blood increased. Extra-pulmonal tuberculosis is not unusual in HIV seropositive patients from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. However, in such patients isolated tuberculosis of the pancreas is unusual and has not previously been described in the Netherlands. The diagnosis can be established following a CT guided puncture; tuberculosis is instantly suspected if the Ziehl-Neelsen stains are positive and the diagnosis can then be confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and by culturing. Anti-retroviral therapy is withheld until response to anti-tuberculosis treatment is satisfactory."

To demonstrate the difficulties of the differential diagnosis between tuberculosis and sarcoidosis as the cause of posterior uveitis. Case reports. A 56-year-old woman suffered from bilateral anterior uveitis, snowball like infiltrates in the vitreous, and peripheral retinochoroidal granulomas with marked exudation shown in fluorescein angiography. Angiotensin-converting enzyme, as a marker of sarcoidosis, was elevated; the tuberculin test, however, was negative. Chest X-ray revealed an infiltrate and numerous smaller granulomas. The presumptive diagnosis was sarcoidosis. Surprisingly, in the biopsy of the pulmonal lesion tubercle bacilli were detected by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Thus, a diagnosis of pulmonal and also retinochoroidal tuberculosis was made. After tuberculostatic therapy the choroidal lesions healed off. In a second case, a 30-year-old man suffered from bilateral panuveitis with candle wax exudates near the retinal vessels. Chest X-ray revealed lymphomas in the hilus,and the lymph node biopsy showed granulomas with epitheloid cells, indicating sarcoidosis. Detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis by culture or histological criteria was negative. Only in the PCR was mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA detectable. Tuberculostatic therapy had no benefit. Under therapy with steroids, however, pulmonal and ophthalmologic findings rapidly disappeared. Conclusion. The difficult differential diagnosis between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis cannot always be made by laboratory tests or diagnostic imaging alone. Clinical manifestations, including response to therapy, are essential."

Patients with retinal vasculitis are subjected to extensive but unrewarding systemic workup. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is now commonly used to detect DNA of infective organisms including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This study was undertaken to characterize the clinical characteristics of PCR-positive tubercular retinal vasculitis, so as to determine the clinical presentation, associated systemic features, management, and course of this form of vasculitis. Methods: The clinical records of 13 patients seen between 1997 and 1999 with the diagnosis of PCR-positive tubercular retinal vasculitis from the aqueous or vitreous humor were reviewed. Recorded data included age, sex, race, visual acuity, anterior and posterior segment findings, and results of diagnostic evaluations. All received antituberculosis therapy with or without concomitant corticosteroids. Laser scatter photocoagulation was done in eyes with neovascularization. One eye with vitreous hemorrhage was subjected to pars plana vitrectomy. Results: There were 9 (69.2%) male and 4 (30.7%) female patients with a median age of 20 years. The disease was bilateral in seven. The most consistent finding was the presence of vitritis in all the eyes followed by vitreous snowball opacities in 17 eyes (89.4%), neovascularization in 11 eyes (57.8%), retinal hemorrhages in 10 eyes (52.6%), neuroretinitis in 10 eyes (52.6%), focal choroiditis in 9 eyes (47.3%), vitreous/preretinal hemorrhage in 5 eyes (26.3%), and serous retinal detachment in 3 eyes (15.7%). Over a median follow-up of 12 months, all showed resolution of vasculitis with no recurrences. Conclusions: Polymerase chain reaction-positive tubercular retinal vasculitis had varied associated fundus findings. Its recognition is important so as to order only relevant diagnostic tests."

Due to its difficult and non-specific diagnosis, M. bovis has been declared to be one of the etiologic agents causing significant economic loss in the cattle industry. Our group evaluated a more rapid and specific method, based on a new polymerase chain reaction species-specific primers, which amplifies a 470-base pair fragment of the M. bovis genome. A total of 275 milk-producing cows were studied by intradermal tuberculin test (ITT) which gave 184 positive and 91 negative cases. From them, 50 animals were taken from a cattle ranch free of tuberculosis. Three different samples were collected from each animal (blood, nasal mucus, and milk). Positive results were obtained from 26 animals by PCR (11.4%), 1 by bacteriological culturing (0.4%) and 1 by bacilloscopy (0.4%). This finding suggests, as in previous reports, that ITT, normally used for bovine tuberculosis detection, has the inconvenience of having a broad range of specificity and sensitivity, and the PCR technique is a more specific and sensitive test to detect infection associated with M. bovis. Therefore, we propose this PCR assay as a useful tool in the epidemiological characterization of infected animals in areas considered to be at high risk of transmission."

This infection causes disseminated disease, is difficult to diagnose, and is of serious concern because it causes significant mortality in birds. A new method was developed for processing specimens for an antemortem screening test for ATB. This novel method uses the zwitterionic detergent C18-carboxypropylbetaine (CB-18). Blood, bone marrow, bursa, and fecal specimens from 28 ducks and swabs of 20 lesions were processed with CB-18 for analysis by smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Postmortem examination confirmed nine of these birds as either positive or highly suspect for disseminated disease. The sensitivities of smear, culture, and PCR, relative to postmortem analysis and independent of specimen type, were 44.4%, 88.9%, and 100%, respectively, and the specificities were 84.2%, 57.9%, and 15.8%, respectively. Reductions in specificity were due primarily to results among fecal specimens. However, these results were clustered among a subset of birds, suggesting that these tests actually identified birds in early stages of the disease. Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping identified one strain of M. avium (serotype 1) that was isolated from lesions, bursa, bone marrow, blood, and feces of all but three of the culture-positive birds. In birds with confirmed disease, blood had the lowest sensitivity and the highest specificity by all diagnostic methods. Swabs of lesions provided the highest sensitivity by smear and culture (33.3% and 77.8%, respectively), whereas fecal specimens had the highest sensitivity by PCR (77.8%). The results of this study indicate that processing fecal specimens with CB-18, followed by PCR analysis, may provide a valuable first step for monitoring the presence of ATB in birds.

V2 CDR3 TCR analysis showed that the remaining V2 cells in the CSF of TBM patients were still polyclonal. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with an involvement of V9/V2 T cells in TBM."

M. tuberculosis L-forms could be produced spontaneously or induced by isoniazid or D-cyclic serine, that influenced the synthesis of cell walls. Among the acid-fast organisms isolated from the patients, more L-forms were found than vegetative forms. In extrapulmonary tuberculosis, M. tuberculosis disseminated through the blood mainly in L-forms, L-forms could adhere on the surface or harbor inside the red cells. With the loss of cell walls, L-forms of M. tuberculosis lost some of their pathogenic features, specific for diagnosis, e.g. OT reaction remained negative and no tuberculosis tubercles formed. In most of these patients only interstitial inflammation could be seen in different organs, similar to that of virus or mycoplasma infection. Unless acid-fast, immunohistochemical staining or isolation was made, it often led to misdiagnosis in histological examination. According to clinical examinations and animal experiments, M. tuberculosis L-forms were found to be closely related to pulmonary carcinoma, especially in adenocarcinoma L-forms were isolated in 34.38% of the cases. M. tuberculosis L-forms were low in pathogenicity, the diseases caused were often escaped from being noticed. M. tuberculosis L-forms were found in 86% of abnormal feeling in nasopharynx, in 32% of chronic prostatitis. M. tuberculosis L-forms were also found in semen of infertile male, the adhesion of L-forms on the sperms inhibited their motility. M. tuberculosis L-forms grew better and faster in liquid than on solid media. The most sensitive method of detection was the using of immunohistochemical technique. In acid-fast staining IK method was better than ZN method. In compensation to the loss of cell walls, the cell membranes became greatly thickened, that increased the difficulty in DNA extraction for PCR examination. Physical grinding could be used to increase the positive rate in detection. M. tuberculosis vegetative forms as well as L-forms proved to be equally important in recognition and elimination of M. tuberculosis. Further study in L-forms of M. tuberculosis is necessary for controlling tuberculosis.  Scandinavian University Press 1998."

We evaluated clinical characteristics of 14 patients with the CNS tuberculosis (10 male and 4 female, 21 to 71 years of age) who were hospitalized at IMCJ from 1988 to 1997. Twelve patients had tuberculous meningitis (2 of them had also intracranial tuberculoma), 1 had intracranial tuberculoma and 1 had spinal cord tuberculosis. For the acid-fast bacilli, the smears of cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) were all negative but the cultures for M. tuberculosis were positive in 5. Using PCR method, M. tuberculosis was identified from CSF specimens in 2 out of 9 culture negative patients, thus suggesting the usefulness of the PCR for the rapid diagnosis of CNS tuberculosis. The adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in CSF may provide another diagnostic clue because they were elevated in 8 out of 10 cases. It is to be noted that there were three patients who developed clinical manifestations of CNS tuberculosis after the initiation of chemotherapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. In the last five cases, four-drug regimen which included PZA, was used with a good result. The success could be related to the addition of PZA which penetrates blood-brain barrier just as good as INH. Two patients died and one remains unconscious with severe neurological sequelae. The present study indicates that positive CSF culture, hydrocephalus and consciousness disturbance are important factors in determining poor prognosis of the CNS tuberculosis."

In the age-group of more than 65 years the risk of acquiring infections and to die of serious complications is substantially higher than in younger people. One of the leading causes of infectious morbidity and mortality is pneumonia. The annual incidence of pneumonias requiring hospitalisation increases from 0.54 cases in the age group from 35 - 44 years to 11.6 cases per 1,000 persons in people over 75 years of age. Atypical presentation of pneumonia in elderly patients delays the initiation of antibiotic therapy and hence increases the risk of a fatal outcome. The most common pathogen in severe pneumonia is Streptococcus penumoniae. Gramnegative bacteria like Haemophilus influence, Moraxella catarrhalis and E. coli are more frequent in the elderly than in younger patients. Another important pathogen is Chlamydia pneumoniae. Viruses are rare except for influenza during epidemics and respiratory syncytial virus. Tuberculosis has always to be included into the diagnostic considerations. The microbiologic diagnosis of pneumonia includes blood and sputum culture and serological investigations for Legionella, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The microbiological diagnosis of tuberculosis is based on microscopical examination and the standardised culture in liquid and on solid media. Amplification methods such as PCR contribute to a rapid diagnosis. According to the spectrum of pathogens -lactam antibiotics followed by macrolides are the most important antimicrobials for the initial therapy of pneumonia in the elderly. Vaccinations against influenza and pneumococcal diseases are significantly preventive measures and should be offered to all elderly people."

This study describes a comparative evaluation of the colorimetric and fluorometric methods for the detection of NO in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection in human peripheral blood-derived monocytes (PBM) and in U937, a human monocyte- derived cell line. MTB was grown in monocyte cultures in vitro for 7 or 10 days. RPMI 1640 medium, without antibiotics and supplemented with L-arginine, Hepes, 5% human AB serum, and tetrahydrobiopterin was used to support monocyte growth. As early as 72 h after infection, soluble nitrite was detectable in the medium using the fluorometric assay with diaminonaphthalene (DAN). Early induction of NO correlated with an increase in the levels of iNOS mRNA as quantitated by RT-PCR. NO levels increased progressively up to day 10 (PBM) or day 7 (U937), when 150-200 nM/106 cells of soluble nitrite accumulated in cultures, as measured by DAN. Furthermore, monocytes stained positively for human iNOS protein and peroxynitrite after infection with MTB. The induction of NO by MTB was inhibited by four different inhibitors of iNOS enzyme including N-monomethylarginine. Inhibition of NO resulted in the enhancement of the intracellular growth of two of five clinical isolates of MTB. NO released from a donor (S-nitroso-N-penicillamine) also had a direct bacteriostatic effect on the same isolates in broth cultures. MTB strains thus showed a differential susceptibility to intracellular and extracellular NO. In most of these assays, the Greiss reagent was limited by its sensitivity and remained negative for soluble nitrite throughout the 7-10 days of incubation. Thus, the colorimetric method, which is widely used, may give false-negative results in NO assays. This report also demonstrates for the first time that MTB induces mRNA for iNOS, iNOS protein, NO, and peroxynitrite in human monocyte/macrophage cultures."

However, numerous procedures in clinical diagnosis and new therapeutic drugs have resulted from basic molecular research. Furthermore, understanding of the physiological and physiopathological mechanisms underlying several human diseases has been improved by the results of basic molecular research. For example, cloning of the gene encoding leptin has provided spectacular insights into the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the control of food intake and body weight maintenance in man. In cystic fibrosis, the cloning and identification of several mutations in the gene encoding the chloride channel transmembrane regulator (CFTR) have resolved several important issues in clinical practice: cystic fibrosis constitutes a molecular defect of a single gene. There is a strong correlation between the clinical manifestations or the severity of the disease (phenotype) with the type of mutations present in the CFTR gene (genotype). More recently, identification of mutations in the gene encoding a subunit of the renal sodium channel in the Liddle syndrome has provided important insights into the physiopathological understanding of mechanisms involved in this form of hereditary hypertension. Salt retention and secondary high blood pressure are the result of constitutive activation of the renal sodium channel by mutations in the gene encoding the renal sodium channel. It is speculated that less severe mutations in this channel could result in a less severe form of hypertension which may correspond to patients suffering from high blood pressure with low plasma renin activity. Several tools, most notably PCR, are derived from molecular research and are used in everyday practice, i.e. in prenatal diagnosis and in the diagnosis of several infectious diseases including tuberculosis and hepatitis. Finally, the production of recombinant proteins at lower cost and with fewer side effects is used in everyday clinical practice. Gene therapy remains an extraordinary challenge in correcting severe hereditary or acquired diseases. The use of genetically modified animal cell lines producing growth factors, insulin or erythropoietin, which are subsequently encapsulated and transferred to man, represents an attractive approach for gene therapy."

Once established, the procedure was used in the analysis of 179 additional samples from 133 patients suspected of tuberculosis. In general there was an agreement between the results of PCR and clinical diagnosis for tuberculosis. In the case of sputum samples it was possible to compare the PCR and culture results. When considering all the sputum samples analysed, in general the PCR was slightly less sensitive than the culture test. However, when applied to the analysis of samples from patients suspected of tuberculosis, six samples that were culture negative were positive by PCR. Considering the confirmed results of all clinical samples analysed, the sensitivity of the method described in this work (97.4%) was much higher than culture test (45.5%). This difference was mainly due to the low sensitivity of culture test in cerebrospinal fluid, serum and blood samples.

There is a need for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. We have previously used a PCR to detect circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in blood samples from patients (mostly HIV-infected) with pulmonary tuberculosis. We have now prospectively investigated the role of this blood-based PCR assay for diagnosis of this disease in a clinical setting. Methods. Our PCR assay is specific for the IS6110 insertion element of the M tuberculosis complex of organisms. We from ward pulmonary tuberculosis. Personnel who carried out the assay did not know the results of any clinical investigations and ultimate diagnosis, and clinicians did not know the PCR results. Results of the PCR assay were compared with the final clinical diagnosis. A subgroup of 15 patients had blood samples assayed serially to track the PCR signal over time. Findings. 41 patients had a final clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis, and the cases were typical of those seen at our hospital: HIV infection was common, and most cases were not sputum-smear positive for acid-fast bacilli. The PCR assay correctly identified 39 of 41 patients with proven pulmonary tuberculosis, 26 (63%) of whom were sputum-smear negative. There were five patients in whom a positive PCR result did not accord with the final clinical diagnosis, and two of the 44 negative PCR results were classified as false negatives. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay for a diagnosis of tuberculosis was 95% and 89%, respectively. In 15 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and a positive blood assay, the PCR result remained positive after 1 month of therapy, but had reverted to negative in 13 of the 15 by 4 months of therapy. Interpretation. We conclude that peripheral-blood-based PCR detection for the diagnosis of tuberculosis Is a technically feasible approach that has a potentially important role in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis."

In this lecture, the recent advances in the basic studies on tuberculosis researches which were reported in Tuberculosis panel of the program were summarized. The host defence mechanisms against M. tuberculosis infection were the most important subject. The role of Th1-mediated cytokins such as IL-2, IFN and TNF in the host defence mechanism against mycobacterial infection was extensively discussed. Bcg gene of the mice is the example case for the genetic background of host against mycobacterial infection. The virulence factor, however of M. tuberculosis is still unknown. The technique of molecular biology was applied to the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The PCR and RFLP methods are the useful strategies for the rapid diagnosis and analysis of the mode of infection with M. tuberculosis. The development of detection techniques of drug-resistant tubercle bacilli is also urgently required. Another approach by molecular biology to tuberculosis research is the cloning of gene of tuberculin protein and the production recombinant protein of M. tuberculosis. The amino acid sequences of several proteins have been determined and their immunological properties of recombinant proteins were investigated. The immunological functions of lipid fractions of tubercle bacilli such as cord factor (TDM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) have been described. Especially the immunomodulating activities and the role of TDM as diagnostic antigen in the tuberculosis patients were described. The adjuvant activity of mycobacterial cell wall was well established and the minimum structural requirement was reported to be N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D- isoglutamine (MDP). The several MDP derivatives were selected as the cytokine inducers. Especially MDP Lys (L18) was widely used as drug for the increasing the number of white blood cells and platelets in cancer patients. The effectiveness of MDP derivatives on the stimulating of mucosal immunity was also recently reported. The preventing activities of virus infection and cancer metastasis of MDP derivatives were shown in mice models."

He showed nuchal rigidity slightly. CSF analysis showed 833 white blood cells (WBC) (80% monocyte), protein value of 68 mg/dl, glucose level of 36 mg/dl and ADA level of 11.8 IU/l. Brain pre-contrast CT indicated high density area in right parietal lobe, and it showed slightly homogeneously enhancement with contrast medium. MRI on T2WI demonstrated hypointense lesion with bright central core in right parietal lobe. The lesion showed isointense on T1WI, and indicated homogeneous enhancement with Gd-DTPA. He was sent to our hospital after one week. With only antibiotics the symptoms were relieved and the CSF findings improved during the previous hospital. However, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) DNA was detected in CSF by PCR amplification, and he recovered completely with anti-tuberculous treatment. This case was interesting to reveal atypical features of spontaneous recovery. Since Shankar's study using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of M. tuberculosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the PCR assay have been recognized to be a rapid method for diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM). But there are problems of PCR sensitivity when dealing with CSF samples containing small amount of M. tuberculosis DNA. Comparing direct PCR with nested PCR, we studied on the evaluation of PCR fur diagnosis of TBM. In this study the nested PCR was positive in all CSF specimens from 4 patients with TBM, but we could not detect M. tuberculosis DNA by only the direct PCR. Nested PCR amplification improved the sensitivity and specificity. Therefore the nested PCR assay will be necessary for rapid diagnosis of TBM on the clinical laboratory."

Whether the infection results from reactivation or reinfection is debated. Since methods for in vitro cultivation still are not successful, the diagnosis is dependant on direct demonstration of the organism in respiratory specimen. In this thesis laboratory diagnostic methods in terms of staining, sampling, antibody detection and DNA amplification are evaluated. Furthermore, the occurrence of the organism in the Western world versus Africa, and in symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV infected patients is studied and discussed. The use of a monoclonal antibody (MAb), 3F6 in an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFL) was compared to the two most commonly used chemical stains, silver methenamine and toluidine blue. The IFL method detected both cyst and trophozoite stages of P. carinii and was more sensitive than the chemical stains when applied to sputum samples. Among commercialised MAbs for P. carinii detection by IFL, only the indirect tests were readily applicable to ethanol treated HIV inactivated samples. In contrast to the MAb 3F6, (Dakopatts), the MAb from Northumbria stained only a selection of the cysts and no trophozoites. The relative sensitivity of IFL in detecting the organism in sputum samples compared to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples was estimated to be at least 70%. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can amplify specific DNA fragments, was used for the demonstration of P. carinii in sputum and BAL specimens. The PCR was shown to be specific and more sensitive than IFL. However, P. carinii DNA was found in a few patients without clinical evidence of present, past or future PCP. Thus the possibility of PCR to detect colonization must be considered. Detection of antibodies to P. carinii by indirect IFL was studied in HIV versus non-HIV patients. A titer rise was seen in 45% of non-HIV patients versus only 3% in HIV patients during a PCP episode. No humoral response was seen in AIDS patients, whereas the serology did support the clinical PCP diagnosis in a proportion of the otherwise immunosuppressed patients. Serology may however not be of help in the acute setting. In the beginning of 1988 PCP had not yet been reported from Central Africa where the AIDS epidemic by then was growing fast. The occurrence of P, carinii in Central Africa was evaluated by a comparative study on induced sputum samples from HIV infected patients with pulmonary infection in Stockholm, Sweden and Lusaka, Zambia. No conclusive evidence for the presence of P. carinii pneumonia in Lusaka was found, instead 50% of the patients selected suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis. It was concluded that PCP was of minor importance in Lusaka. In a prospective study on induced sputa from 60 HIV infected patients, asymptomatic infection with P. carinii was found to occur in 5 patients, all of whom progressed to PCP. Thus asymptomatic infection with P. carinii occurs and should be regarded as pathological. There was no evident correlation between conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic P. carinii infection and the immunosuppression as measured by CD4+ cell counts. The overall incidence of PCP appeared to correlate with decreasing CD4 counts but after varying times of reaching critical low values. Hence, in spite of extremely low CD4 counts 6 of 13 patients did not develop PCP during 200 days of observation. These findings do not support the reactivation theory and the possibility of reinfection should be considered."

The bacteriological examination of sputum on admission revealed negative Gaffky score, but positive PCR, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated by culture. Her symptoms and chest radiogram were improved by the administration of isoniazid, ethambutol and rifampicin. Although development of pulmonary tuberculosis induced by chest wall injury is rare, in case of the aged persons such possibility should be considered. PCR may be useful for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis, even in such case.  1994, Japan Society for Equilibrium Research. All rights reserved."

All smear positive samples were PCR positive except for 7/138 (5.07%) that were false negative because of the presence of inhibitors. However, the use of several samples for each patient minimize the false negative results. The PCR allowed the detection of more positive results in smear negative sputa from HIV- (50%) than in HIV+ patients (20.5%). In contrast, in smear negative blood samples, PCR was positive more frequently in HIV+ (30%) than in HIV- patients (12.5%). Regarding patients, 15/25 HIV+ and 13/17 HIV-patients had at least one positive sample with PCR whereas only 7/25 and 11/17 respectively for HIV+ and HIV- patients had smear positive samples. Thus with some technical cares, PCR might be a useful tool for rapid diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection in smear negative samples particularly in HIV+ patients."
