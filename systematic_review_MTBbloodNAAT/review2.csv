In 32 of these patients, the diagnosis of tuberculosis was eventually confirmed by conventional bacteriological or histological procedures. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected with the PCR technique in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 9 of 11 (82%) HIV-infected patients and in 7 of 21 (33%) HIV-negative patients (P < 0.01), while M. tuberculosis blood cultures were positive in 1 of 8 (12.5%) and 1 of 18 (5.5%) patients, respectively. PCR was positive in all cases with disseminated disease in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients and also in the HIV-positive patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Seven samples from patients with documented illness other than tuberculosis and 12 specimens from healthy volunteers, including seven volunteers with a recent positive purified protein derivative test, were used as controls and had a negative PCR. These results suggest that detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may be a useful tool for rapid diagnosis of disseminated and extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis, especially in an HIV-positive population.",1,NA,case-control,Patients admitted to hospital with high suspicion of disseminated or localised tuberculosis,suspected disseminated TB,Patients with alternative diagnosis and healthy volunteers,in house IS6110 pcr,5,PBMC isolation,38,inpatient,0.4,adult,0.5,1,13,11,0.82,1,10,0.2,22,0.64,Spain,yes,NA,high,0,NA,Microbiological,32,26,2,13,2,1,Consecutive,1,NA,NA,1,1,NA,1,0

The inadequate sensitivity of Ziehl-Neelsen staining and its inability to distinguish atypical mycobacteria delays accurate diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of TB in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blood and extra-pulmonary samples from patients with AIDS and pulmonary infiltrates. DESIGN: Specimens from 103 HIV-1-infected patients were prospectively analysed using bacteriological methods and IS6110-PCR. Smear-positive samples were also tested using 16S ribosomal-DNA-PCR to identify Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. Gold standard diagnosis relied on positive cultures or treatment outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients exhibited TB, one TB and MAC and four MAC. The sensitivity of IS6110-PCR was 100% in smear-positive samples, 81.8% in smear-negative BAL, 66.7% in extra-pulmonary samples and 42.9% in blood. Its specificity was 97.1% in BAL and 100% in extra-pulmonary and blood specimens. The 16S rDNA-PCR identified M. avium from all smear-positive samples that grew MAC.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical relevance of detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. DESIGN: Single-centre prospective case study of 90 hospitalised patients and 50 healthy subjects or blood donors from 1 January to 30 June 1998. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis (26.7%); 20 tuberculosis patients were culture-positive, with seven smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli. Sensitivity of smear, culture and nested PCR was 30.4 (7/23), 87 (20/23) and 30.4% (7/23), respectively. The specificity of smear and culture was 100%, and the specificity of the nested PCR was 96% in the healthy subjects. However, the specificity decreased to 83.6% in the hospitalised patients, with 11 nested PCR-positive patients without a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The sensitivity of the nested PCR was low in pulmonary tuberculosis (22.2%), but increased in pulmonary/extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (50%), extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (33%), and disseminated tuberculosis (33%). CONCLUSION: The use of a nested PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis with regard to low sensitivity and specificity.

The AMTDT is based on amplification of rRNA, whereas the Amplicor MAI Test amplifies a specific DNA region of the 16S rRNA gene. The results of amplification techniques were compared with those of standard culture and culture in BACTEC 13A and BACTEC 12B liquid media. A total of 121 blood specimens and 15 bone marrow aspirates were collected from 136 AIDS patients. Mycobacterial growth was recovered for 103 specimens; 35 yielded M. tuberculosis, 62 yielded M. avium, 5 yielded M. genavense, and 1 yielded M. kansasii. The values of sensitivity and specificity in pretreated specimens for detection of M. tuberculosis by the AMTDT were 94.3 and 100%, respectively, and those for detection of M. avium by the Amplicor MAI Test were 91.9 and 100%, respectively. The simple lysis method described in the present work allows the recovery of mycobacteria from blood specimens and bone marrow aspirates and may be used in combination with the AMTDT and the Amplicor MAI Test to detect and identify different members of the genus Mycobacterium.

Methods:A study was designed to assess the diagnostic value of PCR targeted to IS 1081 in peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals because of ease of obtaining periodic samples. A cohort of 129 individuals was recruited for this purpose. It contained of adult, non-pregnant HIV sero-positive as well as HIV sero-negative individuals who were nave to anti-Koch's treatment at two teaching hospitals in Mumbai. Results: The cohort of 129 individuals was categorized into 5 groups based on their clinical TB and HIV status. The mean CD4 count for TB+HIV+(Groups 1,2,3) ranged between 381 and 525 cells/cmm suggesting early to moderate immune suppression.TB PCR assay was compared with the 'gold' standard, namely the LJ culture in each of the 5 groups. Overall, the sensitivity of PCR was 83.3% and specificity was 97.1%. PCR+ LJ-were subjected to sequential TB PCR tests at intervals of two weeks after initiation of AKT.TB PCR+ patients converted to TB PCR negative between 6-8 weeks. Conclusions: The study established that PCR targeted to IS 1081 is a valuable test for early diagnosis of TB from peripheral blood at an early point of TB activation when most patients (>85%) did not produce other traditional specimens such as the sputum and/or pleural fluid.

A better understanding of the microbiology of bloodstream infections could improve outcomes. METHODS: We used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based TaqMan Array Card (TAC) to directly test for 43 targets from whole blood. We analyzed 336 cryopreserved specimens from adult Ugandans with sepsis enrolled in a multisite study; 84% were infected with human immunodeficiency virus. We compared qPCR TAC results with blood culture and determined the association of qPCR with study participant outcomes using logistic regression. RESULTS: The most frequently detected targets were cytomegalovirus (CMV, n = 139, 41%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB, n = 70, 21%), Plasmodium (n = 35, 10%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 31, 9%). Diagnostic performance varied by target with qPCR sensitivity averaging 61  28% and specificity 98  3% versus culture. In multivariable analysis, independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included CMV viremia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-5.5; p < .01) and TB qPCR-positivity, whether blood culture-positive (aOR 4.6, 95% CI, 2.1-10.0; p < .01) or blood culture-negative (aOR 2.9, 95% CI, 1.2-6.9; p = .02).

We prospectively evaluated the usefulness of PCR performed in blood and urine samples from patients with proved or probable TB compared with a control group of patients. The PCR technique was performed using IS6110 primers. We included in the study 57 patients (43 with definite TB and 14 with probable TB) and 26 controls. Blood and urine samples were drawn at the time of microbiologic diagnosis and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months later. Cultures were positive in the early period (<1 month after treatment) in 11 of 57 patients (19%) with probable or definite TB, in comparison with 42% of patients (24/57) who yielded a positive PCR (P = 0.02). Urine samples increased the sensitivity of PCR determination in blood samples by 10%. The PCR in blood and/or urine was positive in 41% of patients with pulmonary TB, in 36% of patients with extrapulmonary TB, and in 50% of patients with disseminated TB. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was still detectable by PCR in 5 of 13 patients with cured TB after 1 or more months of antituberculous treatment. The PCR detection of M. tuberculosis in blood and urine samples is useful for the diagnosis of different clinical forms of TB, mostly in those patients in which sample extraction is difficult or requires aggressive techniques. The sensitivity of this technique could be improved studying more than 1 sample in each patient, even after initiating an antituberculous treatment.",1,NA,case-control,Patients admitted to hospital with tuberculosis confirmed by culture or probable TB on clinical diagnosis,diagnosed PTB or EPTB,healthy volunteers,IS6110 pcr,5,PBMC isolation,70,inpatient,0.44,adult,0.32,1,25,25,0.32,NA,NA,NA,14,0.29,Spain,yes,NA,high,1,results not reported such that a 2x2 table cross-tabulating BC and NAAT results can be extracted,Microbiological,57,57,5,13,NA,0,Consecutive,1,NA,NA,1,1,NA,1,0

Recently, the Gene-Xpert platform, a rapid, PCR-based diagnostic platform, has been validated for the diagnosis of TB with sputum. We have evaluated the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteremia and investigated its impact on clinical outcomes. Consecutive HIV-infected adults with fever and cough presenting to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, were recruited and followed up for 2 months. At presentation, three sputum samples were examined by smear, culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the presence of M. tuberculosis and blood was drawn for PCR with Xpert, for mycobacterial culture (Myco/F Lytic), and for aerobic culture. One hundred four patients were recruited, and 44 (43%) were sputum culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Ten were Xpert blood positive, for a sensitivity of 21% and a specificity of 100%. The 2-week mortality rate was significantly higher among patients who were Xpert blood positive than among those who were negative (40% versus 3%; multivariate odds ratio [OR] for death if positive, 44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3 to 662). This effect persisted on assessment of the mortality rate at 2 months (40% versus 11%; OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 24.6). When screening uncomplicated patients presenting with a productive cough for pulmonary TB, Xpert blood offers no diagnostic advantage over sputum testing. Despite this, Xpert blood positivity is highly predictive of early death and this test rapidly identifies a group of patients in urgent need of initiation of treatment.",1,NA,cohort,HIV positive patients with fever and cough,PUO,Patients with a final diagnosis not TB,Xpert MTB/Rif,20,RBC lysis and concentration without wash,104,inpatient,1,adult,0.21,1,104,44,0.21,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,Malawi,yes,NA,low,0,NA,Microbiological,44,44,9,9,5,1,Consecutive,1,NA,NA,1,1,NA,1,0

Only three of 12 patients with a positive blood culture had a PCR result positive for M. avium in peripheral blood.

These infections pose a major risk to travelers to these regions as well. Methods: We developed and evaluated a multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the simultaneous detection of the three pathogens in 305 patients' buffy coat samples. Results: The assay for S. typhi and B. pseudomallei was able to detect down to 1 colony forming unit/5 L PCR input and M. tuberculosis was detected down to 20 genome copies/5 L PCR input. S. typhi was detected in 10 (3.3 %) individuals, B. pseudomallei in 10 individuals (3.3 %), and M. tuberculosis in 18 individuals (5.9 %). Co-infections of M. tuberculosis and B. pseudomallei were detected in three individuals and S. typhi and B. pseudomallei in two individuals. Conclusion: This protocol is efficient for PUO diagnosis especially in Asian countries.  2013 Springer International Publishing.",1,NA,cohort,Outpatients with PUO,PUO,TB blood culture negative patients,IS6110 PCR,5,buffy coat extraction,305,outpatient,unclear,mixed,1,0.96,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7,1,India,yes,NA,high,0,NA,Microbiological,7,50,7,18,7,1,Consecutive,1,NA,NA,0,1,NA,1,0
