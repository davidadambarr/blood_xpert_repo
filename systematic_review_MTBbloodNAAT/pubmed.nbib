TI  - Dysregulation of Apoptosis Is a Risk Factor for Tuberculosis Disease Progression.
PG  - 1469-79
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiv238 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major barrier to effective tuberculosis control is our limited 
      understanding of risk factors for tuberculosis disease progression. This study 
      examined the role of apoptosis in immunity to tuberculosis. METHODS: Cell subsets 
      from tuberculosis cases and tuberculin skin test-positive (TST(+)) and TST-negative 
      (TST(-)) household contacts (HHCs) were analyzed for expression of annexin-V and 
      propidium iodide by flow cytometry. RNA microarrays were used to determine 
      differences in apoptotic gene expression levels and multiplex ligation-dependent 
      probe amplification was used to analyze gene expression in HHCs who progressed to 
      active tuberculosis. RESULTS: T cells from TST(+)HHC exhibited higher levels of 
      apoptosis than tuberculosis cases; however, tuberculosis cases had a higher 
      proportion of late apoptotic cells within the CD3(+)PD-1(+) subset. Tuberculosis 
      cases had reduced levels of antiapoptotic genes compared to HHCs with a significant 
      reduction in BCL2 associated with disease progression at least 1 year prior to 
      progression. CONCLUSIONS: While T cells are clearly able to mount a robust immune 
      response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, there are increased levels of apoptosis seen 
      in effector T cells from tuberculosis patients. Dysregulation of several apoptotic 
      genes suggest that apoptosis is a major functional pathway that could be targeted 
      for future host-directed therapeutics.

TI  - Monocyte-derived IL-5 reduces TNF production by Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific 
      CD4 T cells during SIV/M. tuberculosis coinfection.
PG  - 6320-8
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1202043 [doi]
AB  - HIV-infected individuals are significantly more susceptible to tuberculosis (TB) 
      than uninfected individuals. Although it is established that HIV reduces 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific T cell responses, the causes of this dysfunction 
      are not known. We used the cynomolgus macaque model of TB to demonstrate that ex 
      vivo SIV reduces the frequency of M. tuberculosis-specific TNF and IFN-γ-producing T 
      cells within 24 h after infection. In vivo, T cell IFN-γ responses in granulomas 
      from animals with SIV/M. tuberculosis coinfection were lower than SIV-negative 
      animals with active TB. The SIV effects on the inhibition of T cell responses were 
      primarily on APCs and not the T cells directly. Specifically, reductions in the 
      frequency of TNF-producing M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cells were caused, at 
      least in part, by SIV-induced production of monocyte derived IL-5.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to direct detect Mycobacterium bovis in milk 
      (n = 401) and blood (n = 401) samples collected from 401 dairy cows of 20 properties 
      located in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) 
      targeting the region of difference 4 (RD4). Risk factors possibly associated with 
      bovine tuberculosis (BTB) were also evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 802 samples analyzed, 
      one milk (0.25%) and eight blood (2%) samples were positive for M. bovis in the qPCR 
      and their identities were confirmed by sequencing. Animals positive for M. bovis 
      were found in six (30%) of the 20 properties visited. None of the risk factors 
      evaluated were statistically associated with BTB. CONCLUSIONS: M. bovis DNA was 
      detected in one milk sample what may pose a risk to public health because raw milk 
      is commonly consumed in Brazil.

AB  - Mycobacterium bovis is the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle but also 
      infects other animals, including humans. Previous studies in cattle have 
      demonstrated that the protection induced by BCG is not complete. In order to improve 
      the protection efficacy of BCG, in this study we overexpressed Ag85B in a BCG 
      Pasteur strain, by using an expression system based on the use of an auxotrophic 
      strain for the leucine amino acid, and complementation with leuD. We found that 
      vaccination of cattle with BCG overexpressing Ag85B induced higher production of 
      IL-17 and IL-4 mRNA upon purified protein derivative (PPDB) stimulation of 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than vaccination with BCG. Moreover, the 
      IL-17 mRNA expression after vaccination negatively correlated with disease severity 
      resulting from a subsequent challenge with M. bovis, suggesting that this cytokine 
      is a potential biomarker of cattle protection against bovine tuberculosis. 
      Importantly, vaccination with the recombinant BCG vaccine protected cattle better 
      than the wild-type BCG Pasteur.

TI  - Lumbar puncture requirement in acute hemiparesis: diagnosis of tuberculous 
      meningitis after hemiparesis in a child.
PG  - 2139-42
LID - 10.1007/s00381-014-2454-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections are an important acquired cause of cerebral arteriopathy. 
      Tuberculous (TB) meningitis leading to infectious cerebral vasculopathy is a rare 
      cause of acute hemiparesis. CASE REPORT: A 14-year-old male patient was examined 
      after acute hemiparesis developing within 1 day. Neurological examination revealed 
      total hemiplegia on the left side. Brain MRI findings showed bilateral focal 
      T2-weighted signal hyperintensity in the subcortical and deep white matter regions. 
      There were also areas of restricted diffusion in the right basal ganglia. Although 
      the father had a history of pulmonary TB, the patient had not been given TB 
      prophylaxis because of PPD negativity. At lumbar puncture, opening cerebrospinal 
      fluid (CSF) pressure was 50 cm/H20, CSF protein 66.9 mg/dL, and glucose 54 mg/dL 
      (concurrent blood glucose 93 mg/dL); 170 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per cubic 
      millimeter were present in CSF. Following tests for TB, treatment was started 
      immediately with four anti-TB drugs. TB PCR of CSF and acid-fast bacteria (AFB) 
      staining in gastric aspirate were positive. At clinical follow-up, the patient was 
      able to walk with support at the end of the first month. CONCLUSION: Various 
      infectious agents have been reported as causes of cerebral vasculopathy. TB, which 
      affects a significant number of patients worldwide, should be kept in mind in terms 
      of cerebral vascular complications. Lumbar puncture is essential in order to 
      diagnose TB meningitis.

TI  - Nonhealing vegetating plaque on the finger: tuberculosis verrucosa cutis.
PG  - 30-3
AB  - Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis is an uncommon form of tuberculosis that typically 
      presents as a chronic warty plaque. It develops in individuals with moderate to high 
      immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis due to inoculation of an open wound. We 
      present the case of a Somali man born in the United Kingdom who presented with a 
      nonhealing ulcer on the right hand of 10 years' duration. The patient was diagnosed 
      with tuberculosis verrucosa cutis based on clinical suspicion, which was confirmed 
      by several investigations including strongly positive results of a Mantoux test, 
      IFN-gamma release assay, typical histology on skin biopsy, and polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) analysis positive for mycobacterial DNA. Treatment with quadruple 
      antituberculous therapy produced rapid resolution of the ulcer. This unusual 
      condition often is overlooked in the differential diagnosis of nonhealing ulcers, 
      yet it has an excellent prognosis with treatment. A high index of suspicion is

TI  - Lateral medullary syndrome due to brain stem tuberculoma.
PG  - 382-4
AB  - Brainstem tuberculomas are quite unusual, accounting for less than 5 % of all 
      intracranial tuberculoma. Intracranial tuberculoma is rare form of central nervous 
      system tuberculosis. Lateral medullary syndrome is a combination of clinical 
      features commonly attributed to infarction in territory of posterior inferior 
      cerebellar artery or vertebral artery. We report a case suffering from lateral 
      medullary syndrome resulting from brainstem tuberculoma which has not been reported 
      so far in the literature. This patient was started on antituberculous chemotherapy 
      and repeat magnetic resonance imaging of the cranium revealed regression of the 
      lesion.

TI  - Unimpaired clearance of Mycobacterium bovis BCG infection in selectively T-cell 
      anergic TCR-V beta 8.2 transgenic mice.
PG  - 499-505
AB  - The anergy induced in mice with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) has been shown to 
      involve selective unresponsiveness in cytokine expression. While interleukin-2 
      (IL-2), IL-3 and IL-4 mRNA levels are substantially reduced in anergic T cells upon 
      restimulation with SEB, mRNA for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is expressed normally. 
      On the other hand, infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis is known to break an 
      established T-cell anergy. This knowledge prompted us to examine the effect of 
      infection with an intracellular microbe, bacillus Calmett-Guérin (BCG), on the 
      expression of anergy induced with SEB. We have demonstrated that while the 
      SEB-induced anergy was not abrogated by BCG infection, the V beta 8.2 transgenic 
      mice, in which almost all T cells were anergized with SEB, were capable of 
      developing the effective acquired protective immunity, possibly through the 
      preserved capacity to induce IFN-gamma leading to induction of nitric oxide 
      synthase.

AB  - Inhibition of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by components of the analyzed 
      specimen is an important problem in analysis of clinical material by this method. 
      The inhibitory activity of clinical material can be decreased by additional 
      purification of DNA by gel filtration on microcolumns. The method was developed 
      using blood-containing specimens and tried on many clinical specimens. Commercial 
      PCR kit for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis was used. The proposed method for 
      DNA purification notably improves the efficacy of detecting the agents by PCR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identification of blood biomarkers that prospectively predict 
      progression of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease might 
      lead to interventions that combat the tuberculosis epidemic. We aimed to assess 
      whether global gene expression measured in whole blood of healthy people allowed 
      identification of prospective signatures of risk of active tuberculosis disease. 
      METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we followed up healthy, South African 
      adolescents aged 12-18 years from the adolescent cohort study (ACS) who were 
      infected with M tuberculosis for 2 years. We collected blood samples from study 
      participants every 6 months and monitored the adolescents for progression to 
      tuberculosis disease. A prospective signature of risk was derived from whole blood 
      RNA sequencing data by comparing participants who developed active tuberculosis 
      disease (progressors) with those who remained healthy (matched controls). After 
      adaptation to multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), the signature was used 
      to predict tuberculosis disease in untouched adolescent samples and in samples from 
      independent cohorts of South African and Gambian adult progressors and controls. 
      Participants of the independent cohorts were household contacts of adults with 
      active pulmonary tuberculosis disease. FINDINGS: Between July 6, 2005, and April 23, 
      2007, we enrolled 6363 participants from the ACS study and 4466 from independent 
      South African and Gambian cohorts. 46 progressors and 107 matched controls were 
      identified in the ACS cohort. A 16 gene signature of risk was identified. The 
      signature predicted tuberculosis progression with a sensitivity of 66·1% (95% CI 
      63·2-68·9) and a specificity of 80·6% (79·2-82·0) in the 12 months preceding 
      tuberculosis diagnosis. The risk signature was validated in an untouched group of 
      adolescents (p=0·018 for RNA sequencing and p=0·0095 for qRT-PCR) and in the 
      independent South African and Gambian cohorts (p values <0·0001 by qRT-PCR) with a 
      sensitivity of 53·7% (42·6-64·3) and a specificity of 82·8% (76·7-86) in the 12 
      months preceding tuberculosis. INTERPRETATION: The whole blood tuberculosis risk 
      signature prospectively identified people at risk of developing active tuberculosis, 
      opening the possibility for targeted intervention to prevent the disease. FUNDING:

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is 
      highly devastating. Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most common form of CNS 
      tuberculosis (TB). Rapid, sensitive, and affordable diagnostic tests are not 
      available. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain has a very low sensitivity in cases of TBM, the 
      sensitivity rates is of about 10-20%.The detection rate can be improved by taking 
      large volume CSF samples (>6 ml) and prolonged slide examination (30 min). Culture 
      of MTB from the CSF is slow and insufficiently sensitive. The sensitivity is 
      different, which varies from 36% to 81.8%. The microscopic observation drug 
      susceptibility (MODS) assay was recommended by the World Health Organization in 
      2011. The sensitivity is 65%, which is more sensitive and faster than CSF smear. 
      Commercial PCR assays were found to be insensitive at detecting MTB in CSF samples. 
      Many research provided the value of ADA on the TBM diagnosis. Interferon-gamma 
      release assays (IGRAs) are not recommended for diagnosis of active TB disease. 
      Imaging is essential in diagnosis and showing complications of CNS TB. Thwaites 
      criteria and the Lancet consensus scoring system (LCSS) were developed to improve 
      the diagnosis of TBM. Clinicians will continue to make judgment based on clinical 
      examination, inflammatory CSF examinations, imaging studies, and scoring systems.

AB  - For the ICU physician, the failure to consider, diagnose, and treat tuberculosis 
      (TB) results in increased morbidity and mortality, and poses risks to both patients 
      and health care providers. At present, the diagnosis of TB depends on the detection 
      of either mycobacteria or mycobacterial products from clinical specimens. Given the 
      risks posed to both the patient and health care providers by undiagnosed and/or 
      untreated TB, the ability to diagnose TB rapidly in the ICU cannot be understated. 
      In this regard, nucleic acid amplification tests provide relatively quick 
      information about the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) DNA. If 
      available, a blood-based test that would accurately identify persons with TB would 
      be of use in the ICU. Currently available tests such as the T-Spot.TB or 
      QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube can discern infection with Mtb, but are not recommended 
      for the ICU as they cannot rule out TB. In this review, we will discuss the 
      increasing literature that would suggest that a blood-based diagnostic that reflects 
      the host response to TB could be used to diagnose TB in the ICU.

LID - 37
AB  - The decision to treat active tuberculosis (TB) is dependent on microbiological tests 
      for the organism or evidence of disease compatible with TB in people with a high 
      demographic risk of exposure. The tuberculin skin test and peripheral blood 
      interferon-γ release assays do not distinguish active TB from a cleared or latent 
      infection. Microbiological culture of mycobacteria is slow. Moreover, the 
      sensitivities of culture and microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and nucleic acid 
      detection by PCR are often compromised by difficulty in obtaining samples from the 
      site of disease. Consequently, we need sensitive and rapid tests for easily obtained 
      clinical samples, which can be deployed to assess patients exposed to TB, 
      discriminate TB from other infectious, inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, and to 
      identify subclinical TB in HIV-1 infected patients prior to commencing 
      antiretroviral therapy. We discuss the evaluation of peripheral blood 
      transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to develop the next generation of rapid 
      diagnostics for active TB. We catalogue the studies published to date seeking to 
      discriminate active TB from healthy volunteers, patients with latent infection and 
      those with other diseases. We identify the limitations of these studies and the 
      barriers to their adoption in clinical practice. In so doing, we aim to develop a 
      framework to guide our approach to discovery and development of diagnostic 
      biomarkers for active TB.

AB  - New diagnostics are needed to improve clinicians' ability to detect tuberculosis 
      (TB) disease in key populations such as children and persons living with HIV and to 
      rapidly detect drug resistance. Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) in plasma is a 
      diagnostic target in new obstetric and oncologic applications, but its utility for 
      diagnosing TB is not known. Here we show that Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA 
      can be detected in plasma of persons with sputum smear-positive TB, even in the 
      absence of mycobacteremia. Among 40 participants with bacteriologically-confirmed 
      smear-positive TB disease who had plasma tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR), 18/40 
      (45%) had a positive result on at least one triplicate reaction. Our results suggest 
      that plasma DNA may be a useful target for improving clinicians' ability to diagnose 
      TB. We anticipate these findings to be the starting point for optimized methods of 
      TB ccfDNA testing and sequence-based diagnostic applications such as molecular 
      detection of drug resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We evaluated the application value of Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT.TB in the 
      diagnosis of bone and joint tuberculosis. METHODS: One hundred two patients with 
      suspected bone and joint tuberculosis (BJTB) were admitted to Zhengzhou Orthopaedics 
      Hospital, Henan, China from April 2018 to February 2019. The Xpert MTB/RIF and 
      T-SPOT.TB tests were performed using pus specimens and peripheral blood, 
      respectively. The diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT.TB tests was 
      evaluated on the basis of the composite reference standard (CRS). RESULT: A Total of 
      73 suspected BJTB were enrolled and categorized, including 12 confirmed BJTB, 27 
      probable BJTB and 34 non-BJTB. When CRS was used as the reference, the specificity, 
      PPV and NLR values of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay were significantly higher than those 
      of the T-SPOT.TB assay (97.1% vs. 82.4%, p < 0.05; 96.7% vs. 85.4%, p < 0.05; 0.26 
      vs. 0.12, p < 0.05). However, the sensitivity, NPV and PLR values of the T-SPOT. TB 
      assay were significantly higher than those of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (89.7% vs. 
      74.4%, p < 0.05; 87.5% vs. 76.7%, p < 0.05; 5.08 vs. 2.52, p < 0.05). The AUCs from 
      Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT. TB tests were 0.857 and 0.860, respectively. However, the 
      difference was not statistically significant. The Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT. TB tests 
      demonstrated medium concordance in diagnosing BJTB. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of 
      T-SPOT.TB test combined with the specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF not only shorten the 
      time of diagnosis but also improve the accuracy of diagnosis of BJTB and reduce the 
      misdiagnosis rate. Therefore, they are useful for early diagnosis of BJTB.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the serological diagnostic value of Mycobacterium (M.) 
      tuberculosis four new antigens Rv0432, Rv0674, Rv1566c and Rv1547. Methods:Rv0432, 
      Rv0674, Rv1566c and Rv1547 were amplified from M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv genomic 
      DNA by using PCR, among which Rv1547 was divided into two segments for amplification 
      (Rv1547-1 and Rv1547-2). The segments were cloned into expression vector PET-32a 
      while the recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography. Serums were 
      incubated with BL21 (DE3) proteins. Antibodies IgG against M. tuberculosis were 
      tested with 151 serum samples (41 healthy people and 110 TB patients) by using 
      ELISA. The diagnostic efficiency of antigens was analyzed by means of receiver 
      operating characteristic curve. Difference of the objective proteins in TB patients 
      and healthy controls was compared by t-test. Results: Recombinant antigens Rv0432, 
      Rv0674, Rv1566c, Rv1547-1 and Rv1547-2 were successfully expressed and purified. 
      Results from ELISA showed that the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive 
      value, negative predictive value, Youden index and area under the curve of Rv0432, 
      Rv0674, Rv1566c, Rv1547-1 and Rv1547-2, as 43.64%-92.73%, 80.49%-92.68%, 0.92-0.94, 
      0.38-0.80, 0.363-0.732 and 0.649-0.915. All the objective proteins showed 
      significantly higher antibody levels in TB patients, when compared to the healthy 
      controls (P<0.000 1). Conclusion: The newly identified antigens Rv0432, Rv0674, 
      Rv1566c, Rv1547-1 and Rv1547-2 all performed well when being used for TB serological 
      diagnosis, thus were expected to be new candidate antigens used for TB diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) among Diabetes Mellitus (DM) population is more 
      expected to fail treatment of TB due to smear-negative TB. OBJECTIVE: We sought to 
      compare and evaluate different methods to study the frequency of TB infections among 
      DM patients. METHODS: Blood, sputum and urine samples were collected from 500 newly 
      identified diabetic patients from different diabetic clinics in Warangal districts. 
      Smear microscopy, Culture and Line Probe Assay by Polymerase Chain Reaction (LPA 
      PCR) were used for identification of tuberculosis. RESULTS: Based on the chest X-Ray 
      of 200 diabetic patients, suspected with pulmonary infections, 113 were males, 85 
      were females and 2 were children. All 200 patients were tested for tuberculosis 
      infections, 55 were confirmed based on chest X-ray lesions. Off 55 patients, 30 were 
      positive and 25 were negative for AFB microscopy, but were shown positive for chest 
      X-ray. 22 were reported to be culture positive on solid media and identified as 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis based on morphology and biochemical methods. 36 samples 
      were identified to be positive for LED, FM microscopy and LPA. Off 36 positive 
      samples, 2 were MDR-TB and 34 were MTB based on LPA PCR method. Off 25 smear 
      negative samples, 2 were identified as culture positive and confirmed to be MTB by 
      morphological, biochemical tests. CONCLUSION: Smear Negative Microscopy plays a 
      vital role in the spread of tuberculosis infection among diabetic patients. Along 
      with the smear microscopy, there is a need to rely on other methods for rapid 
      identification and diagnosis of tuberculosis among the diabetic patients to control 
      the spread of infection in the community and household contacts.

TI  - Newer Diagnostic Tests and their Application in Pediatric TB.
PG  - 441-447
LID - 10.1007/s12098-018-2811-0 [doi]
AB  - The diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis is a challenge due to the pauci-bacillary 
      nature of infection and the difficulty in obtaining appropriate sample. In the past 
      2-3 decades, many new tests were introduced for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) 
      and some of them have been evaluated for their application in pediatric tuberculosis 
      as well. There is an attempt to improve smear microscopy by introducing 
      light-emitting diode (LED) fluorescence microscopy and there are also some automated 
      digital microscopy platforms under evaluation. Introduction of automated liquid 
      culture platform along with rapid molecular based identification methods have 
      considerably reduced the time delay in mycobacterial culture. Recent addition of 
      many nucleic acid amplification platforms like Amplicor PCR, Genprobe, Xpert 
      MTB/Rif, line probe assays, loop mediated isothermal amplification etc are also been 
      found to be useful. Latest techniques like microarray and gene sequencing are also 
      being used in clinical laboratories with variable results. Indirect methods of TB 
      diagnosis like T cell based assays including tuberculin skin test and 
      interferon-gamma release assays have their role primarily in the diagnosis of latent 
      TB. Biomarkers are the latest addition in the battery of TB diagnostic tests 
      facilitating diagnosis using easily accessible samples like urine, blood and breath 
      of patients. Many biomarkers are still under evaluation and some of them are found 
      to have a potential role as promising diagnostic tests of future.

LID - 10.1007/s12098-019-03032-0 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of CSF Xpert MTB/RIF (GeneXpert) in diagnosis of 
      tubercular meningitis in children in the age group of 2 mo to 12 y. METHODS: This 
      hospital based prospective observational study was conducted at Department of 
      Pediatrics, Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Hubli from December 2015 
      through November 2016. All children with clinically suspected tuberculous meningitis 
      (TBM) were included in the study. These children underwent a detailed history 
      taking, clinical examination, blood investigations, lumbar puncture and CT brain. 
      Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were sent for CSF GeneXpert examination. 
      Statistical analysis was done using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20. RESULTS: A total 
      of 28 children were enrolled in the study. Six (21.4%), 4 (14.3%) and 18 (64.3%) 
      cases were definite, probable and possible TBM cases respectively. Most common age 
      group affected was <5 y (83.33%) with median age 2.5 y (IQR 4.875). Male:female 
      ratio was 1.5:1. CSF GeneXpert was tested positive in 6 cases (21.4%). The 
      sensitivity of the test against the clinical scoring (>/=10) was 46.15% (95% CI, 
      19.22-74.87) and specificity was 100% (95% CI, 78.20-100). There was a significant 
      association between CSF GeneXpert and Mantoux test (P = 0.002), CSF cell type >50% 
      lymphocytes (P = 0.005) and CSF protein >100 mg/dl (P = 0.025) along with CT 
      hydrocephalus (P = 0.021), granuloma (P = 0.009) and basal exudates (P = 0.025). 
      None of the cases were tested smear positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). 
      CONCLUSIONS: CSF GeneXpert is superior to smear for AFB in TBM.

TI  - Biological markers in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion.
PG  - 19-27
LID - 10.1684/abc.2016.1201 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis is one of the main etiologies to evoke in the context of lymphocyte 
      pleurisy. However, diagnosis is difficult and is based on mycobacteriology that is 
      not enough sensitive and time-consuming, or on histology that requires invasive 
      biopsy gesture. This literature review, carried out from Medline, summarizes the 
      main meta-analyzes, reviews, and originator publications in English on biomarkers, 
      classic and more innovative, studied for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy. 
      Among the immuno-biochemical markers, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), isoenzyme of adenosine 
      deaminase 2 (ADA2) and total adenosine deaminase (ADA) seem the most relevant with 
      respective sensitivities of 89% (87-91), 97.2% (95 to 98.7) and 92% (90-93) and 
      specificities of 97% (96-98), 94.2% (91.8 to 96) and 90% (89-91). About molecular 
      biology, PCR Xpert MTB/RIF has a sensitivity of 46.4% (26.3 to 67.8), which is much 
      higher than the direct examination, while providing rapid diagnostic confirmation, 
      with a specificity of 99.1% (95.2 to 99.8), and a resistance to rifampicin 
      screening. The release assay of interferon-γ (IGRA) is less effective with a 
      sensitivity of 75% (69-81) and a specificity of 82% (75-88) in blood and a 
      sensitivity of 80% (74-86%) and a specificity of 72% (64-80) in pleural fluid. Other 
      biomarkers (including several cytokines) might have an interest but are still under 
      evaluation. These innovative methods, particularly the determination of ADA and the 
      use of PCR Xpert MTB/RIF should find their place in the diagnostic algorithm of TB 
      pleurisy.

TI  - Multidisease testing for HIV and TB using the GeneXpert platform: A feasibility 
      study in rural Zimbabwe.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV Viral Load and Early Infant Diagnosis technologies in many high 
      burden settings are restricted to centralized laboratory testing, leading to long 
      result turnaround times and patient attrition. GeneXpert (Cepheid, CA, USA) is a 
      polyvalent near point-of-care platform and is widely implemented for Xpert MTB/RIF 
      diagnosis. This study sought to evaluate the operational feasibility of integrated 
      HIV VL, EID and MTB/RIF testing in new GeneXpert platforms. METHODS: Whole blood 
      samples were collected from consenting patients due for routine HIV VL testing and 
      DBS samples from infants due for EID testing, at three rural health facilities in 
      Zimbabwe. Sputum samples were collected from all individuals suspected of TB. 
      GeneXpert testing was reserved for all EID, all TB suspects and priority HIV VL at 
      each site. Blood samples were further sent to centralized laboratories for 
      confirmatory testing. GeneXpert polyvalent testing results and patient outcomes, 
      including infrastructural and logistical requirements are reported. The study was 
      conducted over a 10-month period. RESULTS: The fully automated GeneXpert testing 
      device, required minimal training and biosafety considerations. A total of 1,302 HIV 
      VL, 277 EID and 1,581 MTB/RIF samples were tested on a four module GeneXpert 
      platform in each study site. Xpert HIV-1 VL testing was prioritized for patients who 
      presented with advanced HIV disease, pregnant women, adolescents and suspected ART 
      failures patients. On average, the study sites had a GeneXpert utilization rate of 
      50.4% (Gutu Mission Hospital), 63.5% (Murambinda Mission Hospital) and 17.5% 
      (Chimombe Rural Health Centre) per month. GeneXpert polyvalent testing error rates 
      remained lower than 4% in all sites. Decentralized EID and VL testing on Xpert had 
      shorter overall median TAT (1 day [IQR: 0-4] and 1 day [IQR: 0-1] respectively) 
      compared to centralized testing (17 days [IQR: 13-21] and 26 days [IQR: 23-32] 
      respectively). Among patients with VL >1000 copies/ml (73/640; 11.4%) at GMH health 
      facility, median time to enhanced adherence counselling was 8 days and majority of 
      those with documented outcomes had re-suppressed VL (20/32; 62.5%). Median time to 
      ART initiation among Xpert EID positive infants at GMH was 1 day [IQR: 0-1]. 
      CONCLUSION: Implementation of near point-of-care GeneXpert platform for integrated 
      multi-disease testing within district and sub-district healthcare settings is 
      feasible and will increase access to VL, and EID testing to priority populations. 
      Quality management systems including monitoring of performance indicators, together 
      with regular on-site supervision are crucial, and near-POC test results must be 
      promptly actioned-on by clinicians for patient management.

TI  - OMNIgene SPUTUM: A good transport and decontaminating reagent for tuberculosis 
      testing.
PG  - 222-227
LID - 10.4103/ijmy.ijmy_102_18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sputum culture is limited to centralized facilities. Thus, samples 
      require transportation from peripheral laboratories to these facilities, 
      compromising specimen quality since it is difficult to maintain cold chain. We 
      evaluated OMNIgene SPUTUM Reagent (OMS) for transporting sputum samples for 
      tuberculosis (TB) testing. The study was carried out at Noguchi Memorial Institute 
      for Medical Research using sputa from Korle Bu Teaching Hospital and La General 
      Hospital in Ghana. METHODS: In a laboratory-based controlled experiment (CE), sputum 
      contaminants were determined on blood agar before treatment with OMS and 
      N-acetyl-L-cysteine-sodium hydroxide (NALC-NaOH). TB testing included smear 
      microscopy, culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF. Afterward, two peripheral laboratories were 
      trained to transport sputum samples with OMS without cold chain. Positivity, 
      negativity, and contamination rates were compared between both methods using 
      Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Cohen's Kappa was also used to determine 
      agreements. RESULTS: Among 104 sputum samples analyzed in the CE, 93 (89.4%) had 
      bacterial growth on blood agar before decontamination, while 6 (5.8%) and 5 (4.8%) 
      contaminated after NALC-NaOH and OMS treatment, respectively. Contamination was high 
      with NALC-NaOH (12.8%) than OMS (4.3%) on Lowenstein-Jensen media (P < 0.001), but 
      mycobacterial positivity was comparable: NALC-NaOH of 74.5% and OMS of 78.7%. Smear 
      positivity after NALC-NaOH treatment was 89.4% and OMS was 75.9% (P = 0.491). All 
      except one of the samples tested positive by Xpert MTB/RIF after both treatment. 
      Sixteen samples were evaluated in the field experiment and 81.3% yielded positive 
      culture, and no contamination on LJ was observed. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate 
      that OMS works well as a transport and decontaminating reagent of samples for TB 
      testing.

AB  - The present study was aimed to assess the prevalence and efficiency of techniques 
      for the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) including enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA), Gamma interferon assay (IFN-γ) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 
      comparison to skin tuberculin test and culture technique. A total of 2600 
      cross-breed dairy cattle in Menoufia and Daqahlia governorates were tested by the 
      single intradermal tuberculin test where the disease prevalence was 1.8%. Serum and 
      whole blood samples were collected from positive tuberculin reactors for ELISA and 
      IFN-γ assay, respectively. After slaughtering of positive tuberculin reactors, the 
      post-mortem examination was carried out and tissue samples were collected for the 
      bacteriological examination and PCR. The percentage of visible lesions of tuberculin 
      reactors was 78.7%, while non-visible lesions were 21.27%. Culture technique 
      revealed that the percentage of bTB was 63.8%. The ELISA and IFN-γ assay using 
      short-term culture filtrate (ST-CF) prepared antigen revealed higher sensitivity 
      (72.3% and 82.9%) than the bovine purified protein derivative (PPD-B) antigen. 
      Although prepared ST-CF antigen has great efficiency and eligibility for the 
      diagnosis of bTB, PCR appeared to have a higher sensitivity (85.1%) than other 
      diagnostic methods when dealing with post-mortem samples. Gamma interferon assay 
      using ST-CF antigen is recommended for antemortem diagnosis of bTB in cattle.

TI  - Tuberculosis of the sternoclavicular joint.
PG  - 315-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis of the 
      sternoclavicular joint in 13 patients. METHODS: Records of 9 men and 4 women aged 26 
      to 47 (mean, 36.5) years who presented with tuberculosis of the right (n=8) or left 
      (n=5) sternoclavicular joint were reviewed. RESULTS: All 13 patients had a raised 
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate at presentation. Nine patients presented with 
      systemic symptoms including malaise, fever, or loss of weight/appetite. Local 
      symptoms included cold abscess (n=5), tenderness and non-fluctuant swelling (n=4), 
      and discharging sinus (n=4). The mean duration of symptoms was 2.7 (range, 1-7) 
      months. Four patients had multifocal involvement of the proximal ulna (n=1), lung 
      (n=2), and meninges (n=1). Aspiration (n=3), fine needle aspiration cytology (n=4), 
      drainage (n=2), or curettage (n=4) of the swelling, abscess, or sinus was performed, 
      and the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology (n=8), polymerase chain reaction 
      (n=5), or culture (n=1). Two patients were diagnosed based on clinical suspicion. 11 
      patients responded to antituberculous therapy (ATT), and symptoms resolved after 6 
      to 8 weeks. Two patients did not respond to ATT after 3 months and were screened for 
      immunocompromising disorders or drug resistance. Their CD4 count and CD4:CD8 ratio 
      was low, and an immunomodulation regimen was prescribed as an adjunct to ATT. 
      CONCLUSION: A high level of clinical suspicion is needed to diagnose tuberculosis of 
      the sternoclavicular joint in patients with pain/tenderness, discharging sinus, or 
      cold abscess. A combination of histopathological and microbiological tests, and PCR 
      can confirm the diagnosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis is one of the most prevalent infections in humans. Although 
      culture is the reference for diagnosis, its sensitivity is compromised, especially 
      in paucibacillary samples. Because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifies 
      mycobacterial DNA, it is more sensitive than culture for the diagnosis of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However, its performance can be affected by 
      intrinsic sample inhibitors and by the extraction/detection techniques used. 
      METHODS: We evaluated the influence of preanalytical conditions on Mtb detection in 
      samples of sputum (SPU), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and pleural fluid (PF) using 
      combinations of extraction/detection methods. Respiratory samples were prepared to 
      contain different concentrations of red blood cells and nucleated cells to which 
      increasing amounts of Mtb colonies were inoculated and submitted to PCR. RESULTS: Up 
      to 102 CFU/ml of Mtb were detected in the SPU in all methods, except for the Roche 
      extraction/detection method, regardless of the preanalytical sample condition. In 
      BAL samples, medium and high concentrations of cells and high concentrations of red 
      blood cells contributed to a lower Mtb detection, regardless of the extraction 
      method used. In PF, red blood cells were the variable that most interfered with Mtb 
      detection, with better recovery (102 CFU/ml) observed with the Qiagen/Nanogen 
      combination. CONCLUSION: The choice of Mtb extraction and detection method is of 
      fundamental importance for PCR analytical sensitivity, especially when 
      paucibacillary samples and/or samples containing potential PCR inhibitors are 
      analyzed.

AB  - Biomarkers for tuberculosis treatment outcome will assist in guiding individualized 
      treatment and evaluation of new therapies. To identify candidate biomarkers, RNA 
      sequencing of whole blood from a well-characterized TB treatment cohort was 
      performed. Application of a validated transcriptional correlate of risk for TB 
      revealed symmetry in host gene expression during progression from latent TB 
      infection to active TB disease and resolution of disease during treatment, including 
      return to control levels after drug therapy. The symmetry was also seen in a TB 
      disease signature, constructed from the TB treatment cohort, that also functioned as 
      a strong correlate of risk. Both signatures identified patients at risk of treatment 
      failure 1-4 weeks after start of therapy. Further mining of the transcriptomes 
      revealed an association between treatment failure and suppressed expression of 
      mitochondrial genes before treatment initiation, leading to development of a novel 
      baseline (pre-treatment) signature of treatment failure. These novel host responses 
      to TB treatment were integrated into a five-gene real-time PCR-based signature that 
      captures the clinically relevant responses to TB treatment and provides a convenient 
      platform for stratifying patients according to their risk of treatment failure. 
      Furthermore, this 5-gene signature is shown to correlate with the pulmonary 
      inflammatory state (as measured by PET-CT) and can complement sputum-based Gene 
      Xpert for patient stratification, providing a rapid and accurate alternative to 
      current methods.

AB  - We report here a case that highlights tuberculosis (TB) as a possible cause for 
      pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (c-GN), an important and often treatable 
      cause of kidney injury. A 47-year-old HIV-negative man of mixed ethnicity presented 
      with a 2-week history of cough, haemoptysis and unintentional weight loss. Chest 
      examination revealed crepitations over the right upper zone and urinalysis 
      demonstrated an active urinary sediment with red cell casts. Chest radiograph 
      confirmed right upper lobe cavitation. Serum laboratory investigations revealed a 
      serum creatinine of 632 µmol/L and were negative for antineutrophil cytoplasmic 
      antibodies. A diagnosis of pauci-immune c-GN was made on renal biopsy. In addition, 
      sputum PCR confirmed infection with drug-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      Standard TB treatment and immunosuppression with prednisone and cyclophosphamide was 
      commenced, and over the course of 6 months, renal function improved to an estimated 
      glomerular filtration rate >60 mL/min.

AB  - In this study, we developed a simple multiplex miRNA detection platform based on 
      rolling circle amplification and the fluorescence quenching property of reduced 
      graphene oxide. The detection platform could be applied on a microfluidics chip with 
      a mobile system controller to eliminate contamination and to facilitate potential 
      use in remote areas. As a proof of concept, two fluorescence-labeled ssDNA tags were 
      used for detection of miR-29a and miR-144*, two miRNAs that are highly expressed in 
      the blood circulation of some patients with cancer or tuberculosis. The circular 
      ssDNA probes in this study were designed to have an advantage over padlock probes as 
      they can be prepared in advance. Our multiplex miRNA detection platform exhibited 
      high sensitivity and selectivity, with a limit of detection of 0.05 pmol. In 
      addition, our platform could detect target miRNAs from the total miRNA population 
      extracted from human serum or a cancer cell line. These results indicated that our 
      miRNA sensor has the potential to provide simple and high throughput miRNA analysis 
      for disease diagnosis and prognosis.

AB  - We report a surprising pathological finding of miliary tuberculosis (TB) in a 
      49-year-old Chuukese, immunocompetent woman who was initially admitted to the 
      hospital for a 1-month duration of chronic abdominal pain and intermittent fevers. 
      Her clinical symptoms did not improve despite treatment with vancomycin and 
      piperacillin-tazobactam. Based on the primary abdominal CT findings suggesting 
      advanced ovarian cancer with omental metastatic disease, further workup with omental 
      core biopsy was performed and demonstrated acute neutrophilic necrosis without 
      malignant cells or granulomata. Within the omental tissue, however, many organisms 
      stained positive for acid-fast bacilli despite lack of typical granulomata. The 
      diagnosis of genitourinary TB was confirmed by urine Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis/rifampin automated molecular rapid nucleic acid amplification test. The 
      chest CT showed a millet seed pattern of infiltration which is a hallmark for 
      miliary TB. After initiation of multidrug TB therapy, her fever and abdominal pain 
      drastically improved.

TI  - Interleukin 8 and Pentaxin (C-Reactive Protein) as Potential New Biomarkers of 
      Bovine Tuberculosis.

LID - e00274-19
AB  - Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is caused by Mycobacterium bovis During the early stage of 
      infection, greater than 15% of M. bovis-infected cattle shed mycobacteria through 
      nasal secretions, which can be detected by nested PCR. To compare the differences in 
      the protein profiles of M. bovis-infected cattle that were nested PCR positive 
      (bTB(PCR-P)) and M. bovis-infected cattle that were nested PCR negative (bTB(PCR-N)) 
      and to screen for biomarkers that will facilitate the early and accurate detection 
      of bTB, we investigated the protein expression profiles of serum and bovine purified 
      protein derivative (PPD-B)-stimulated plasma among bTB(PCR-P) (n = 20), bTB(PCR-N) 
      (n = 20), and uninfected cattle (NC; n = 20) by iTRAQ labeling coupled with 
      two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (iTRAQ-2D LC-MS/MS). 
      After comprehensive analysis, we selected 15 putative differentially expressed serum 
      proteins and 15 plasma proteins for validation by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) 
      with the same cohort used in the iTRAQ analysis. Four serum and five 
      PPD-B-stimulated proteins were confirmed in follow-up enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assays. PPD-B-stimulated interleukin 8 (IL-8) displayed the potential to 
      differentiate M. bovis-infected cattle from NC, with an area under the curve (AUC) 
      value of 0.9662, while PPD-B-stimulated C-reactive protein (CRP) displayed the 
      potential to differentiate bTB(PCR-P) from bTB(PCR-N), with an AUC value of 1.00. 
      Finally, double-blind testing with 244 cattle indicated that the PPD-B-stimulated 
      IL-8 test exhibited good agreement with traditional tests (κ > 0.877) with a >90% 
      relative sensitivity and a >98% relative specificity; the PPD-B-stimulated CRP test 
      displayed good agreement with nested PCR (κ = 0.9117), with an observed 94% relative 
      sensitivity and 97% relative specificity. Therefore, the PPD-B-stimulated IL-8 and 
      CRP tests could be used to detect bTB and to differentiate bTB(PCR-P) from 
      bTB(PCR-N).

AB  - Roles of human IL-37 in infections remain poorly characterized. Although plasma 
      IL-37 is elevated in patients with tuberculosis (TB), IL-37 source and immune 
      correlate in TB have not been investigated. It is also unknown whether and how TB 
      can influence the ability of immune cells to mount innate responses of IL-37 and 
      pre-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we demonstrated that IL-37b-producing monocytes 
      coincided with a source of elevated plasma IL-37b in TB patients. While IL-37b 
      production in TB was associated with prolonged/complicated TB, TB burdens and 
      inflammatory reactions, it negatively correlated with immune responses of 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α or IL-10. Interestingly, 
      mycobacterial re-infection of monocytes from TB patients, but not healthy 
      BCG-vaccinated controls, enhanced or sustained IL-37b production by cultured 
      monocytes. TB-sensitized monocytes from TB patients mounted more robust immune 
      responses of IL-37b than those of pre-inflammatory cytokines during mycobacterial 
      re-infection in culture. Our data represent new findings in terms of IL-37b 
      responses, immune correlates and potential mechanisms in TB patients.

TI  - [Role of the Notch signaling pathway in children with tuberculosis].
PG  - 1012-1015
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of molecules associated with the Notch signaling 
      pathway in children with tuberculosis, as well as the role of this pathway in the 
      pathogenesis of tuberculosis in children. METHODS: A total of 62 children who were 
      diagnosed with tuberculosis from June 2017 to December 2018 were enrolled as the 
      case group, and 64 healthy children were enrolled as the healthy control group. 
      Peripheral venous blood samples with a volume of 2 mL were collected, and 
      quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of the 
      molecules associated with the Notch signaling pathway (receptors Notch1-4, ligands 
      Jagged1/2 and DLL1/3/4, and downstream target genes Hes1 and Hey1) in leukocytes. 
      RESULTS: Compared with the healthy control group, the case group had significant 
      increases in the mRNA expression levels of Notch1, Notch2, and DLL4 in leukocytes 
      (P<0.05), while there were no significant differences in the mRNA expression levels 
      of Notch3/4, Jagged1/2, DLL1/3, Hes1, and Hey1 between the two groups (P>0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: There are significant increases in the mRNA expression of Notch1/2 and 
      DLL4 in children with tuberculosis, while there are no significant changes in the 
      expression of downstream target genes, suggesting that the Notch signaling pathway, 
      which is activated by the interaction between Notch1/2 and DLL4 after Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis infection, may play a role in childhood tuberculosis by acting on other 
      target genes, and further studies are needed for clarification.

TI  - Clinical Evaluation of a Blood Assay to Diagnose Paucibacillary Tuberculosis via 
      Bacterial Antigens.
PG  - 791-800
LID - 10.1373/clinchem.2017.273698 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) cases primarily relies on 
      methods that detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli or their DNA in patient 
      samples (e.g., mycobacterial culture and Xpert MTB/RIF assays), but these tests have 
      low clinical sensitivity for patients with paucibacillary TB disease. Our goal was 
      to evaluate the clinical performance of a newly developed assay that can rapidly 
      diagnose active TB cases by direct detection of Mtb-derived antigens in patients' 
      blood samples. METHODS: Nanoparticle (NanoDisk)-enriched peptides derived from the 
      Mtb virulence factors CFP-10 (10-kDa culture factor protein) and ESAT-6 (6-kDa early 
      secretory antigenic target) were analyzed by high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS). 
      Serum from 294 prospectively enrolled Chinese adults were analyzed with this 
      NanoDisk-MS method to evaluate the performance of direct serum Mtb antigen 
      measurement as a means for rapid diagnosis of active TB cases. RESULTS: NanoDisk-MS 
      diagnosed 174 (88.3%) of the study's TB cases, with 95.8% clinical specificity, and 
      with 91.6% and 85.3% clinical sensitivity for culture-positive and culture-negative 
      TB cases, respectively. NanoDisk-MS also exhibited 88% clinical sensitivity for 
      pulmonary and 90% for extrapulmonary TB, exceeding the diagnostic performance of 
      mycobacterial culture for these cases. CONCLUSIONS: Direct detection and 
      quantification of serum Mtb antigens by NanoDisk-MS can rapidly and accurately 
      diagnose active TB in adults, independent of disease site or culture status, and 
      outperform Mycobacterium-based TB diagnostics.

TI  - Etiology of Sepsis in Uganda Using a Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction-based 
      TaqMan Array Card.
PG  - 266-272
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciy472 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of causes of sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa is limited. A better 
      understanding of the microbiology of bloodstream infections could improve outcomes. 
      METHODS: We used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based TaqMan Array 
      Card (TAC) to directly test for 43 targets from whole blood. We analyzed 336 
      cryopreserved specimens from adult Ugandans with sepsis enrolled in a multisite 
      study; 84% were infected with human immunodeficiency virus. We compared qPCR TAC 
      results with blood culture and determined the association of qPCR with study 
      participant outcomes using logistic regression. RESULTS: The most frequently 
      detected targets were cytomegalovirus (CMV, n = 139, 41%), Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (TB, n = 70, 21%), Plasmodium (n = 35, 10%), and Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae (n = 31, 9%). Diagnostic performance varied by target with qPCR 
      sensitivity averaging 61 ± 28% and specificity 98 ± 3% versus culture. In 
      multivariable analysis, independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality 
      included CMV viremia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.8-5.5; p < .01) and TB qPCR-positivity, whether blood culture-positive (aOR 4.6, 
      95% CI, 2.1-10.0; p < .01) or blood culture-negative (aOR 2.9, 95% CI, 1.2-6.9; p = 
      .02). CONCLUSIONS: Using qPCR TAC on direct blood specimens, CMV and TB were the 
      most commonly identified targets and were independently associated with increased 
      in-hospital mortality. qPCR TAC screening of blood for multiple targets may be 
      useful to guide triage and treatment of sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Diagnostic efficiency of Xpert MTB/RIF assay for osteoarticular tuberculosis in 
      patients with inflammatory arthritis in China.
PG  - e0198600
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0198600 [doi]
LID - e0198600
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both osteoarticular tuberculosis (OA-TB) and inflammatory arthritis can 
      lead to osteoarticular structural damage. These conditions exhibit similar symptoms, 
      physical signs, and imaging features. Rapidly and accurately diagnosing OA-TB in 
      patients with inflammatory arthritis presents a challenge to clinicians. Xpert 
      MTB/RIF (Xpert) has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a rapid 
      diagnostic tool for diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. This study was 
      designed to investigate diagnostic efficiency of Xpert for OA-TB in patients with 
      inflammatory arthritis in China. METHODS: A total of 83 consecutive patients with 
      inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB were enrolled prospectively from June 
      2014 to May 2018. Demographic, clinical, and biological data were recorded. Xpert 
      assay, smear microscopy examination (smear), BACTEC MGIT 960 (MGIT 960), 
      pathological examination, and T-SPOT.TB test were performed for each patient who 
      received operations. Diagnostic efficiency of Xpert was evaluated based on a 
      composite reference standard (CRS). RESULTS: A total of 49 out of 83 patients with 
      inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB received operations, and 49 specimens 
      were obtained during operations. According to CRS, 36 out of 49 patients with 
      inflammatory arthritis were diagnosed with OA-TB, and 13 were not affected by the 
      condition. Sensitivity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 960, pathological examination, 
      and T-SPOT.TB test reached 66.70% (24/36), 25.00% (9/36), 30.55% (11/36), 47.22% 
      (17/36), and 80.55% (29/36), respectively. Specificity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 
      960, and pathological examination was all 100% (13/13). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB 
      test was 53.84% (7/13). Sensitivity of Xpert was higher than that of smear, MGIT 960 
      and pathological examination, but the sensitivity of Xpert was lower than that of 
      T-SPOT.TB. Sensitivity of Xpert was statistically different from that of smear and 
      MGIT 960 (P<0.001, P = 0.002), but the sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly 
      different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (P = 0.096, P = 
      0.181). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB was less than that of Xpert, smear, MGIT 960, and 
      pathological examination, and the difference between them was statistically 
      significant (P = 0.015). Among the 27 OA-TB patients with smear negative results, 
      Xpert had the highest sensitivity, but sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly 
      different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (P = 0.413, P = 
      0.783). 2 of 36 OA-TB patients exhibited RIF resistance. Xpert was concordant with 
      MGIT 960-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) in detecting rifampin (RIF) 
      resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Xpert is an efficient tool with high sensitivity and 
      specificity for OA-TB diagnosis in patients with inflammatory arthritis in high-TB 
      prevalence countries. Compared with conventional methods, Xpert has two advantages: 
      one is fast, and the other is able to provide RIF resistance information 
      simultaneously.

PG  - 353-355
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a worldwide scourge and the most common cause of mortality 
      from infectious disease. Around 95% of cases occur in developing country. Renal TB 
      is a rare cases that complicates 3-4% of pulmonary TB patients and commonly 
      overlooked in clinical practice due to its symptoms may mimic other 
      diseases.A-39-year-old man was admitted to our institution due to flank pain. He had 
      history of low grade fever and oligouria since 5 months prior. He had no complaint 
      of cough, dyspnea, or night sweat. He was a non smoker and had no past medical 
      history of tuberculosis. Previous 4 months abdominal ultrasound showed left 
      pelvocaliectasis and ureteral dilatation with suspicion of left ureteral stenosis. 
      Ureterolithiasis could not be excluded. No prostate enlargement or vesicolithiasis 
      was seen. Intravenous pyelography (IVP) examination demonstrated similar finding. 
      Initial laboratory blood examination showed anemia (10.7 g/dl), leukocytosis 
      (14,080/ul), increased in serum creatinin (4.2 mg/dl), ureum (227 mg/dl), and 
      calcium (6.78 mg/dl). Serology examinations were negative for HIV, HBsAg, anti HCV 
      and blood culture had no growth. Urinary examination revealed severe leucocyturia, 
      hematuria, and negative for bacteria, nitrite and cast. Urine culture was positive 
      for Candida glabrata. Pulmonary X-ray suggested right pleural fibrotic. He was 
      initially diagnosed as multiple myeloma with fungal infection. Nevertheless, 
      additional peripheral blood smear showed neither rouleaux formation nor blast. He 
      underwent percutaneous nephrostomy and got micafungin intravenously. Instead of 
      improving, the patient deteriorated and transferred to intensive room. We then 
      explored the possibility of TB infection. Further examination revealed positive for 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis in urinary polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Tracheal 
      sputum examination was positive for acid fast bacilli staining. There was low level 
      of serum vitamin D2 (5.8 ng/ml). He got TB treatment with rifampicin, isoniazid, 
      pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Unfortunately, the patient eventually succumbed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the performance of the IS6110-TaqMan® assay in 
      different types of biological samples and tissues for laboratory diagnosis of 
      extrapulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: 143 biological samples and tissues from 
      patients with suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis from the health services of 
      Recife/Pernambuco/Brazil were evaluated with the IS6110-TaqMan® assay. RESULTS: The 
      sensitivities of the IS6110-TaqMan® assay calculated for blood, urine, both blood 
      and urine samples, tissue biopsies, extrapulmonary body fluid samples, and all 
      samples from patients calculated together were 55.9%, 33.3%, 68.8%, 43.8%, 29.6%, 
      and 73.7%, respectively, and the specificities were 80%, 100%, 78.6%, 100%, 100%, 
      and 84.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of qPCR was high in various 
      clinical sample types. The analysis of more than one type of clinical sample 
      collected from the same patient with extrapulmonary tuberculosis enhances the 
      diagnostic power of the IS6110-TaqMan® assay when compared with the use of only one 
      clinical sample.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNA molecules which are involved in 
      various cellular and physiological processes. Previously, studies have identified 
      several miRNAs that are potential diagnostic biomarkers for various infectious 
      diseases including tuberculosis. We have performed small RNA sequencing using the 
      Ion Torrent PGM platform in extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) subject's serum 
      samples to identify circulating miRNAs during mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) 
      infection. Our analysis identified 20 circulating miRNAs upregulated and 5 miRNAs 
      downregulated during MTB infection in patient's serum. In addition, we have 
      identified 6 MTB genome encoded miRNAs upregulated in EPTB patient's serum samples. 
      Taqman based qRT-PCR analysis of host-genome encoded (hsa-miR-146a-5p and 
      hsa-miR-125b-5p) and MTB genome encoded (MTB-miR5) miRNAs showed increased 
      expression in a cohort of 52 healthy, pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and extra 
      pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) patients serum samples. Our study identified for the 
      first time a panel of host and MTB genome specific differentially expressed 
      circulating miRNAs in serum samples of an Indian patient cohort with tuberculosis 
      infection with a potential as a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker for tuberculosis 
      infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a condition that is caused by 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and is difficult to diagnose due to the 
      nonspecificity of the presentations. The study analyzed the different modes of 
      diagnosis available in a developing country set up over a period of five years to 
      understand the diagnostic values of the current conventional and automated methods 
      of diagnosis of TBM among the patients suspected with chronic meningitis. METHODS: A 
      total of 10,281 cerebrospinal fluid samples (CSF) were collected from suspected 
      chronic meningitis patients, of which 790 samples were from individuals who had 
      clinically suspected TBM. The samples were subjected to CSF cytology and staining, 
      culturing, immunological tests, molecular techniques, and methods for detection of 
      drug resistance. RESULTS: The TBM patients were predominantly male, with a mean age 
      of 21-40 years. CSF pleocytosis and lymphocytic predominance were noted. Culture had 
      40.13% positivity among clinically suspected TBM patients. The multidrug-resistant 
      M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) constituted 3.14% of the total clinical isolates. With 
      IS6110 PCR, a specificity of 92.86% and sensitivity of 100% are seen with an assay 
      threshold of 30pg/ml. Line probe assay (LPA) using culture isolates had a 
      sensitivity of 97.67% and a specificity of 100%. Direct CSF LPA showed a sensitivity 
      of 96.15% and a specificity of 100%. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of techniques that 
      involved culture, cytology, and DNA amplification methods was found to be promising 
      in specific, accurate, and rapid detection of M. tuberculosis in the CSF samples 
      from patients.

TI  - Brief Report: Yield and Efficiency of Intensified Tuberculosis Case-Finding 
      Algorithms in 2 High-Risk HIV Subgroups in Uganda.
PG  - 416-420
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0000000000002162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) risk varies among different HIV subgroups, potentially 
      impacting intensified case finding (ICF) performance. We evaluated the performance 
      of the current ICF algorithm [symptom screening, followed by Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) 
      testing] in 2 HIV subgroups and evaluated whether ICF performance could be improved 
      if TB screening was based on C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. METHODS: We 
      enrolled consecutive adults with CD4 counts ≤350 cells/µL initiating antiretroviral 
      therapy and performed symptom screening, CRP testing using a low-cost point-of-care 
      (POC) assay, and collected sputum for Xpert testing. We compared the yield and 
      efficiency of the current ICF algorithm to POC CRP-based ICF among patients new to 
      HIV care and patients engaged in care. RESULTS: Of 1794 patients, 126/1315 (10%) new 
      patients and 21/479 (4%) engaged patients had Xpert-positive TB. The current ICF 
      algorithm detected ≥98% of all TB cases in both subgroups but required ≥85% of all 
      patients to undergo Xpert testing. POC CRP-based ICF halved the proportion of 
      patients in both subgroups requiring Xpert testing relative to the current ICF 
      algorithm and had lower yield among patients engaged in care [81% vs. 100%, 
      difference -19% (95% confidence interval: -41 to 3)]. Among patients new to care, 
      POC CRP-based ICF had similar yield as the current ICF algorithm [93% vs. 98%, 
      difference -6% (95% confidence interval: -11 to 0)]. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients new 
      to care, POC CRP-based screening can improve ICF efficiency without compromising ICF 
      yield, whereas symptom-based screening may be necessary to maximize ICF yield among 
      patients engaged in care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of severe anaemia in patients with 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in South Africa. However, TB can be 
      difficult to diagnose as it may be extra pulmonary and paucibacillary. AIM: The aim 
      of this study was to investigate undiagnosed TB in patients with HIV infection and 
      severe anaemia and to identify the optimal investigations for diagnosing TB. 
      SETTING: Mthatha General Hospital, a district hospital. METHODS: The study was a 
      case series. RESULTS: Haemoglobin levels ranged from 3.6 g/dL to 7.9 g/dL, the mean 
      CD4 count was 176 cells/μL and 80% of patients had a positive TB symptom screen. 
      Forty-three (86%) patients had either clinical or bacteriologically proven TB of 
      whom 33 had pulmonary TB, 34 had extra pulmonary TB and 24 had both types. The 
      diagnostic yield for TB was: chest X-ray (CXR) 91%; ultrasound (US) abdomen 
      pericardium and lower chest 62%; sputum Xpert MTB/RIF 35%; TB blood culture 21% and 
      TB urine culture 15%. Blood and urine cultures did not identify any additional cases 
      over those identified by CXR and US. The laboratory turnaround times were as 
      follows: sputum Xpert, 1.6 days; blood culture, 20 days and urine culture, 28 days. 
      CXR and US were done within one day of initial patient assessment. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      majority of HIV patients with severe anaemia had TB disease, and extra pulmonary TB 
      was as prevalent as pulmonary TB. CXR, US and sputum Xpert were the optimum tests 
      for rapid diagnosis of TB. South African national TB/HIV guidelines should 
      incorporate these specific tests to diagnose TB in patients with HIV and severe 
      anaemia.

AB  - MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to, and 
      suppressing the expression of genes. Research show that microRNAs have potential to 
      be used as biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment response and can be used for 
      therapeutic interventions. Furthermore, microRNA expression has effects on immune 
      cell functions, which may lead to disease. Considering the important protective role 
      of neutrophils and B-cells during M.tb infection, we evaluated the expression of 
      microRNAs, known to alter function of these cells, in the context of human TB. We 
      utilised real-time PCR to evaluate the levels of microRNA transcripts in the 
      peripheral blood of TB cases and healthy controls. We found that 
      neutrophil-associated miR-197-3p, miR-99b-5p and miR-191-5p transcript levels were 
      significantly lower in TB cases. Additionally, B-cell-associated miR-320a, 
      miR-204-5p, miR331-3p and other transcript levels were higher in TB cases. The 
      miRNAs differentially expressed in neutrophils are predominantly implicated in 
      signalling pathways leading to cytokine productions. Here, the decreased expression 
      in TB cases may imply a lack of suppression on signalling pathways, which may lead 
      to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma. 
      Furthermore, the miRNAs differentially expressed in B-cells are mostly involved in 
      the induction/suppression of apoptosis. Further functional studies are however 
      required to elucidate the significance and functional effects of changes in the 
      expression of these microRNAs.

TI  - Tuberculosis diagnostics for children in high-burden countries: what is available 
      and what is needed.
PG  - S30-7

AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis (TB) is complex and most of the 
      new diagnostics for TB are for adults. AIMS: To review the performance of TB 
      diagnostics and their suitability to its characteristics in young children. METHODS: 
      Expert opinion and review of the literature. MAIN FINDINGS: The lack of a sufficient 
      number of research studies on TB diagnostics for children hinders the preparation of 
      systematic literature reviews. Information on test performance in children is often 
      extrapolated from studies in adults and there is a dearth of evidence of test 
      performance in children. Approaches to shorten the time required for diagnosis (by 
      using a variety of specimens) are needed and there is preliminary evidence that such 
      schemes are feasible. Diagnostics based on smear microscopy such as LED-FM, 
      serological tests and IGRAS are unlikely to improve the diagnosis of active TB in 
      children. Liquid and the MODS culture methods are more sensitive than solid culture, 
      and new methods to detect mycobacterium nucleic acid or its components such as TrDNA 
      fragments, LAMP assays and Xpert MTB/RIF have good potential to increase the number 
      of cases confirmed. These tests should be evaluated in specimens which are easily 
      accessible in children such as fine-needle aspiration biopsy, urine, blood and 
      stools. INTERPRETATION: The evaluation of new diagnostic tests for TB in children is 
      overdue. The lack of suitable diagnostic tests hinders the proper management of 
      children, the assessment of the real burden of childhood TB, evaluation of the 
      efficacy of new treatments and vaccines and, ultimately, the development of 
      effective control interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many countries are facing overlapping epidemics of tuberculosis (TB) and 
      diabetes mellitus (DM). Diabetes increases the overall risk of developing 
      Tuberculosis (TB) and contributes to adverse treatment outcomes. Active screening 
      for both diseases can reduce TB transmission and prevent the development of 
      complications of DM. We investigated bi-directional TB-DM screening in Karachi, 
      Pakistan, a country that ranks fifth among high TB burden countries, and has the 
      seventh highest country burden for DM. METHODS: Between February to November 2014, 
      community-based screeners identified presumptive TB and DM through verbal screening 
      at private health clinics. Individuals with presumptive TB were referred for a chest 
      X-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF. Presumptive DM cases had random blood glucose (RBS) tested. 
      All individuals with bacteriologically positive TB were referred for diabetes 
      testing (RBS). All pre-diabetics and diabetics were referred for a chest X-ray and 
      Xpert MTB/RIF test. The primary outcomes of this study were uptake of TB and DM 
      testing. RESULTS: A total of 450,385 individuals were screened, of whom 18,109 had 
      presumptive DM and 90,137 had presumptive TB. 14,550 of these individuals were 
      presumptive for both DM and TB. The uptake of DM testing among those with 
      presumptive diabetes was 26.1% while the uptake of TB testing among presumptive TB 
      cases was 5.9%. Despite efforts to promote bi-directional screening of TB and DM, 
      the uptake of TB testing among pre-diabetes and diabetes cases was only 4.7%, while 
      the uptake of DM testing among MTB positive cases was 21.8%. CONCLUSION: While a 
      high yield for TB was identified among pre-diabetics and diabetics along with a high 
      yield of DM among individuals diagnosed with TB, there was a low uptake of TB 
      testing amongst presumptive TB patients who were recorded as pre-diabetic or 
      diabetic. Bi-directional screening for TB and DM which includes the integration of 
      TB diagnostics, DM screening and TB-DM treatment within existing health care 
      programs will need to address the operational challenges identified before 
      implementing this as a strategy in public health programs.

AB  - Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most common and severe form of central nervous 
      system tuberculosis. Due to the non-specific clinical presentation and lack of 
      efficient diagnosis methods, it is difficult to discriminate TBM from other frequent 
      types of meningitis, especially viral meningitis (VM). In order to identify the 
      potential biomarkers for discriminating TBM and VM and to reveal the different 
      pathophysiological processes between TBM and VM, a genome-wide miRNA screening of 
      PBMCs from TBM, VM, and healthy controls (HCs) using microarray assay was performed 
      (12 samples). Twenty-eight differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between 
      TBM and VM, and 11 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between TBM and 
      HCs. The 6 overlapping miRNAs detected in both TBM vs. VM and TBM vs. HCs were 
      verified by qPCR analysis and showed a 100% consistent expression patterns with that 
      in microarray test. Statistically significant differences of 4 miRNAs (miR-126-3p, 
      miR-130a-3p, miR-151a-3p, and miR-199a-5p) were further confirmed in TBM compared 
      with VM and HCs in independent PBMCs sample set (n = 96, P < 0.01). Three of which 
      were also showed significantly different between TBM and VM in CSF samples (n = 70, 
      P < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed that 
      the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of these 4 miRNAs in PBMCs were more than 0.70 in 
      discriminating TBM from VM. Combination of these 4 miRNAs could achieve better 
      discriminative capacity [AUC = 0.893 (0.788-0.957)], with a sensitivity of 90.6% 
      (75.0-98.0%), and a specificity of 86.7% (69.3-96.2%). Additional validation was 
      performed to evaluate the diagnostic panel in another independent sample set (n = 
      49), which yielded a sensitivity of 81.8% (9/11), and specificity of 90.0% (9/10) in 
      distinguishing TBM and VM, and a sensitivity of 81.8% (9/11), and a specificity of 
      84.6% (11/13) in discriminating TBM from other non-TBM patients. This study 
      uncovered the miRNA profiles of TBM and VM patients, which can facilitate better 
      understanding of the pathogenesis involved in these two diseases and identified 4 
      novel miRNAs in distinguishing TBM and VM.

TI  - Successful TB treatment induces B-cells expressing FASL and IL5RA mRNA.
PG  - 2037-2043
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.12184 [doi]
AB  - Activated B-cells increase T-cell behaviour during autoimmune disease and other 
      infections by means of cytokine production and antigen-presentation. Functional 
      studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) indicate that B-cell 
      deficiencies, and a lack of IL10 and IL35 leads to a poor prognosis. We hypothesised 
      that B-cells play a role during tuberculosis. We evaluated B-cell mRNA expression 
      using real-time PCR from healthy community controls, individuals with other lung 
      diseases and newly diagnosed untreated pulmonary TB patients at three different time 
      points (diagnosis, month 2 and 6 of treatment).We show that FASLG, IL5RA, CD38 and 
      IL4 expression was lower in B-cells from TB cases compared to healthy controls. The 
      changes in expression levels of CD38 may be due to a reduced activation of B-cells 
      from TB cases at diagnosis. By month 2 of treatment, there was a significant 
      increase in the expression of APRIL and IL5RA in TB cases. Furthermore, after 6 
      months of treatment, APRIL, FASLG, IL5RA and CD19 were upregulated in B-cells from 
      TB cases. The increase in the expression of APRIL and CD19 suggests that there may 
      be restored activation of B-cells following anti-TB treatment. The upregulation of 
      FASLG and IL5RA indicates that B-cells expressing regulatory genes may play an 
      important role in the protective immunity against M.tb infection. Our results show 
      that increased activation of B-cells is present following successful TB treatment, 
      and that the expression of FASLG and IL5RA could potentially be utilised as a 
      signature to monitor treatment response.

TI  - Microarray Expression Profile of Circular RNAs in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells 
      from Active Tuberculosis Patients.
PG  - 1230-1240
LID - 10.1159/000487454 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dysregulated expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) was 
      demonstrated to be implicated in many diseases. Here, we aimed to determine circRNA 
      profile in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from active tuberculosis (TB) 
      patients to identify novel biomarkers for TB. METHODS: Expression profile of 
      circRNAs in PBMCs from 3 active pulmonary TB patients and 3 healthy controls were 
      analyzed by microarray assay. Six circRNAs were selected for validation using real 
      time-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in 40 TB patients and 40 control subjects. Receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate their values in TB 
      diagnosis. Hsa_circRNA_001937 was chosen for further evaluation in an independent 
      cohort consisting of 115 TB, 40 pneumonia, 40 COPD, 40 lung cancer patients and 90 
      control subjects. An eight-month follow up was performed in 20 newly diagnosed TB 
      patients to investigate the expression change of hsa_circRNA_001937 after 
      chemotherapy. RESULTS: We revealed and confirmed that a number of circRNAs were 
      dysregulated in TB patients. Of the six studied physio circRNAs, the levels of 
      hsa_circRNA_001937, hsa_circRNA_009024 and hsa_ circRNA_005086 were significantly 
      elevated and hsa_circRNA_102101, hsa_circRNA_104964 and hsa_circRNA_104296 were 
      significantly reduced in PBMCs from TB patients as compared to healthy controls. ROC 
      curve analysis suggested that hsa_circRNA_001937 has the largest area under the 
      curve (AUC = 0.873, P<0.001). Hsa_circRNA_001937 was significantly increased in 
      patients with TB compared with patients with pneumonia, COPD and lung cancer. Hsa_ 
      circRNA_001937 was correlated with TB severity (r = 0.4053, P = 0.010) and its 
      expression significantly decreased after treatment. CONCLUSION: This study 
      identified a set of deregulated circRNAs in active TB PBMCs, our data also suggest 
      that hsa_circRNA_001937 can be used as a potential diagnostic biomarker of TB.

TI  - Nutritional Adequacy and Latent Tuberculosis Infection in End-Stage Renal Disease 
      Patients.
LID - 10.3390/nu11102299 [doi]
LID - 2299
AB  - BACKGROUND: Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is prevalent in end-stage renal 
      disease (ESRD) patients. The risk of tuberculosis activation is also high. The 
      appropriate LTBI screening and treatment is required in this population. Meanwhile, 
      whether hemodialysis adequacy is associated with LTBI in the ESRD population is 
      unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between hemodialysis 
      adequacy and LTBI in ESRD patients. METHODS: In the present cross-sectional study, 
      we reviewed all outpatient-based ESRD patients in our artificial kidney room. 
      Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) was used for the diagnosis of LTBI. Clinical 
      variables including nutritional adequacy (i.e., normalized protein catabolic rate, 
      nPCR) and dialysis adequacy (i.e., Kt/V) were compared between IGRA-positive and 
      IGRA-negative patients. RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were enrolled, of which 20 
      (22.2%) had positive IGRA results using the QuantiFERON-TB method. Old fibrotic 
      changes and nPCR (g/kg/day) were significantly different between IGRA-positive and 
      IGRA-negative patients (both p < 0.005), while serum albumin and Kt/V were 
      comparable (p = 0.429 and p = 0.590, respectively). Normalized PCR remained to be 
      significant in a multivariate logistic regression analysis (adjusted hazard ratio, 
      0.911 (0.861-0.963); p = 0.001). The cutoff nPCR value less than 0.87 g/kg/day had 
      an adjusted hazard ratio of 7.74 (1.77-33.74) for predicting LTBI. Patients with 
      nPCR value less than 0.87 g/kg/day were older and had lower serum hemoglobin, 
      albumin, calcium concentration, and Kt/V levels than those with nPCR value greater 
      than 0.87 g/kg/day. CONCLUSIONS: Nutritional adequacy, especially when assessing 
      nPCR value, was associated with LTBI, while dialysis adequacy was not associated 
      with LTBI.

TI  - Multiplex PCR from Menstrual Blood: A Non-Invasive Cost-Effective Approach to Reduce 
      Diagnostic Dilemma for Genital Tuberculosis.
PG  - 391-396
LID - 10.1007/s40291-018-0322-3 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Genital tuberculosis (GTB) is a potent contributor to irreversible damage to 
      the reproductive system and infertility in females. As no gold standard diagnostic 
      tool is yet available, clinical suspicion and relatively insensitive approaches such 
      as histopathology, laparoscopy and hysterosalpingogram are currently critical 
      determinants in the diagnosis of GTB. Although a polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR)-based assay using endometrial tissue seems promising, sampling does require an 
      invasive procedure. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that menstrual blood may provide an 
      alternate non-invasive source of samples for PCR-based GTB diagnosis. METHODS: We 
      enrolled 195 women with primary infertility in whom GTB was suspected. We obtained 
      ethics committee approval from our institution and written informed consent from 
      subjects. Endometrial tissue and menstrual blood was collected from the subjects and 
      culture, histopathology, and multiplex PCR with both sample type was performed for 
      each subject. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of multiplex PCR was, 
      respectively, 90.2 and 86.1% for menstrual blood, 95.8 and 84.3% for endometrial 
      tissue, and 64.8 and 93.2% for histopathology staining. CONCLUSIONS: A strong 
      clinical suspicion aided with multiplex PCR using menstrual blood may significantly 
      reduce the diagnostic dilemma for GTB diagnosis in a non-invasive, sensitive, rapid, 
      and cost-effective manner.

      diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis using cerebrospinal fluid samples: a pilot 
      study.
PG  - 556-564
LID - 10.1515/cclm-2018-0524 [doi]
AB  - Background Timely diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) remains challenging. 
      Molecular diagnostic tools are necessary, particularly in low- and middle-income 
      countries. There is no approved commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay 
      that can be used to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis in non-respiratory samples, 
      such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We aimed to validate the threshold cycle (Ct) 
      cut-off points; calculate the operational characteristics of real-time PCR for 
      detection of M. tuberculosis (MTb qPCR) in the CSF; and the inhibitory affect of CSF 
      red blood cells (RBC) and total proteins on MTb qPCR. Methods A total of 334 
      consecutive participants were enrolled. Based on clinical, laboratory and imaging 
      data, cases of suspected TBM were categorized as definite, probable, possible or not 
      TBM cases. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to select the 
      best discriminating Ct value. Results For TBM cases categorized as definite or 
      probable (n=21), the Ct validated for CSF (≤39.5) improved the diagnostic 
      performance of MTb qPCR on CSF samples. The sensitivity was 29%, specificity was 
      95%, positive predictive value was 26%, negative predictive value was 95%, 
      efficiency was 90% and positive likelihood was 5.3. The CSF RBC and total protein 
      did not affect the positivity of the MTb qPCR. Conclusions These data support the 
      validation of a highly specific but low sensitive MTb qPCR assay for the TBM 
      diagnosis using CSF samples. MTb qPCR contributes significantly to the diagnosis, 
      mainly when associated with conventional microbiology tests and clinical algorithms.

TI  - Performance of Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra, and Abbott RealTime MTB for Diagnosis of 
      Pulmonary Tuberculosis in a High-HIV-Burden Setting.

LID - e00560-18
AB  - More sensitive tests are needed for the diagnosis of smear-negative and 
      HIV-associated tuberculosis. This study compares the sensitivities and specificities 
      of three molecular tests, namely, the Xpert MTB/RIF test, the Xpert Ultra (Ultra), 
      and RealTime MTB (RT-MTB), in a high HIV prevalence setting. Symptomatic adults were 
      recruited from three outpatient sites, and each provided 4 sputum specimens. The 
      diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF, Ultra, and RT-MTB was evaluated, with 
      culture as a reference standard. HIV infection occurred in 62% of patients, with a 
      median CD4 count of 220 cells/µl. The Ultra test had the highest sensitivity of 
      89.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.1 to 96) compared to those of the Xpert 
      MTB/RIF at 82.1% (95% CI, 69.6 to 91.1; P = 0.12) and RT-MTB at 78.6% (95% CI, 65.6 
      to 88.4; P = 0.68). The specificity was highest with the Xpert MTB/RIF at 100% (95% 
      CI, 98 to 100), followed by RealTime MTB at 96.7% (95% CI, 92.9 to 98.8; P = 0.03) 
      and the Ultra at 95.6% (95% CI, 91.5 to 98.1; P = 0.08). In patients with 
      smear-negative disease, the Ultra was more sensitive than the Xpert MTB/RIF (64.7% 
      [95% CI, 38.3 to 85.8] versus 41.2% [95% CI, 18.4 to 67.1], respectively; P = 0.12), 
      and RT-MTB performed equally to Xpert MTB/RIF. In a comparison of the Ultra and 
      RT-MTB on the same sputum specimen pellets, the Ultra was more sensitive than RT-MTB 
      in the overall cohort (88.9% [95% CI, 77.4 to 95.8] versus 77.8% [95% CI, 64.4 to 
      88], respectively; P = 0.03) and among people with HIV (87.5% [95% CI, 71 to 96.5] 
      versus 68.6% [95% CI, 50 to 83.9], respectively; P = 0.03). Although these results 
      did not reach statistical significance, they suggest that the Ultra is more 
      sensitive than the Xpert MTB/RIF and RT-MTB, most prominently in smear-negative 
      disease. This was accompanied by a loss of specificity.

LID - 10.5588/ijtld.16.0785 [doi]
AB  - SETTING: In early studies, Xpert® MTB/RIF accurately detected culture-proven 
      pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Recent reports have, however, found a lower than 
      expected specificity in previously treated TB patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate 
      the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert in presumptive pulmonary TB patients in 
      Southwestern Uganda. DESIGN: We obtained demographic and clinical information and 
      collected three sputum samples from each patient for smear microscopy, Xpert and 
      culture. We estimated Xpert sensitivity and specificity against culture, and 
      stratified the analysis by previous treatment and sputum quality status. RESULTS: We 
      analyzed results from 860 presumptive TB patients, including 109 (13%) with a 
      previous history of anti-tuberculosis treatment; 205 (24%) were culture-positive. 
      Xpert specificity was lower (91.8%, 95%CI 84.9-96.2) in previously treated than in 
      new TB patients (97.5%, 95%CI 96.1-98.5; P = 0.01). In an adjusted analysis, 
      patients with culture-, Xpert+ results were more likely to have been previously 
      treated for TB (OR 8.3, 95%CI 2.1-32.0; P = 0.002), and to have mucosalivary sputum 
      (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.1-14.6; P = 0.03), but were less likely to self-report fever (OR 
      0.23, 95%CI 0.1-0.7; P = 0.008) than patients with concordant positive results. 
      CONCLUSION: Xpert specificity was lower in previously treated patients with 
      suspected TB. The clinical and programmatic impact of culture-, Xpert+ results 
      requires evaluation in future studies.

TI  - Sensitive and less invasive confirmatory diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in 
      Sudan using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP).
PG  - e0006264
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0006264 [doi]
LID - e0006264
AB  - BACKGROUND: Confirmatory diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), as well as 
      diagnosis of relapses and test of cure, usually requires examination by microscopy 
      of samples collected by invasive means, such as splenic, bone marrow or lymph node 
      aspirates. This causes discomfort to patients, with risks of bleeding and iatrogenic 
      infections, and requires technical expertise. Molecular tests have great potential 
      for diagnosis of VL using peripheral blood, but require well-equipped facilities and 
      trained personnel. More user-friendly, and field-amenable options are therefore 
      needed. One method that could meet these requirements is loop-mediated isothermal 
      amplification (LAMP) using the Loopamp Leishmania Detection Kit, which comes as 
      dried down reagents that can be stored at room temperature, and allows simple 
      visualization of results. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Loopamp Leishmania 
      Detection Kit (Eiken Chemical Co., Japan), was evaluated in the diagnosis of VL in 
      Sudan. A total of 198 VL suspects were tested by microscopy of lymph node aspirates 
      (the reference test), direct agglutination test-DAT (in house production) and rK28 
      antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (OnSite Leishmania rK39-Plus, CTK Biotech, USA). 
      LAMP was performed on peripheral blood (whole blood and buffy coat) previously 
      processed by: i) a direct boil and spin method, and ii) the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit 
      (QIAgen). Ninety seven of the VL suspects were confirmed as cases by microscopy of 
      lymph node aspirates. The sensitivity and specificity for each of the tests were: 
      rK28 RDT 98.81% and 100%; DAT 88.10% and 78.22%; LAMP-boil and spin 97.65% and 
      99.01%; LAMP-QIAgen 100% and 99.01%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Due to its simplicity 
      and high sensitivity, rK28 RDT can be used first in the diagnostic algorithm for 
      primary VL diagnosis, the excellent performance of LAMP using peripheral blood 
      indicates that it can be also included in the algorithm for diagnosis of VL as a 
      simple test when parasitological confirmatory diagnosis is required in settings that 
      are lower than the reference laboratory, avoiding the need for invasive lymph node 
      aspiration.

AB  - Tuberculosis continuous to be the world's most important infectious disease in 
      addition to malaria and AIDS. One-third of world's population is infected with 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Every tenth of those people will develop active 
      tuberculosis in his or her lifetime. The global tuberculosis incidence rate is 
      falling; however, the rate of decline is less than 1 %. While microscopy and culture 
      are still the gold standard in laboratory diagnostic, remarkable technical progress 
      has recently been made, upgrading the speed and quality of mycobacteriology 
      diagnostic services. The development of improved nucleic acid amplification tests 
      enables the detection of M. tuberculosis-DNA as well as the determination of drug 
      resistance pattern direct from the specimen. Another advance is the implementation 
      of ex vivo interferon-gamma release assays for the detection of latent tuberculosis. 
      This paper includes a brief summary of current state-of-the-art diagnostic tools 
      which are applied for laboratory diagnosis of tuberculosis and drug susceptibility 
      testing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite effort to diagnose tuberculosis (TB) in the Human 
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected population, 45% of adults with HIV that had a 
      previously unknown reason for death, demonstrated TB was the cause by autopsy 
      examination. We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of implementation a new 
      algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) related sepsis among 
      PLHIV presenting with life-threatening illness. METHODS: This study is a prospective 
      cohort conducted in three-referral hospitals in Kilimanjaro, recruited 97 PLHIV from 
      February through June 2018. Patients provided urine and sputum samples for testing 
      lateral flow - lipoarabinomannan (LF-LAM) and Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      (MTB)/rifampicin (RIF) assays, respectively. Anti-TB was prescribed to patients with 
      positive LF-LAM or Xpert MTB/RIF or received broad-spectrum antibiotics but 
      deteriorated. RESULTS: Of 97 patients, 84 (87%) provided urine and sputa, and 13 
      (13%) provided only urine. The mean age (95% confidence interval) was 40 (38-43) 
      years and 52 (54%) were female. In 84 patients, LF-LAM increased TB detection from 
      26 (31%) by Xpert MTB/RIF to 41 (55%) by both tests. Of 97 patients, 69 (71%) 
      prescribed anti-TB, 67% (46/69) and 33% (23/69) had definitive and probable TB 
      respectively. Sixteen (16.5%) patients died, of which one died before treatment, 73% 
      (11/15) died within 7 days of admission. The 30-day survival was similar in both 
      treatment groups (log rank = 0.1574). Mortality was significantly higher among 
      hospitalized patients compared to outpatients (P ≤ 0.027). CONCLUSION: 
      Implementation of new algorithm increased TB case detection in patients that could 
      have been missed by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Survival of PLHIV with confirmed or 
      probable TB was comparable to those of PLHIV that were treated with broad-spectrum 
      antibiotics alone. Further work should focus on the optimal timing and content of 
      the immediate antimicrobial regimen for sepsis among PLHIV in TB-endemic settings.

AB  - We here report the case of a 58-year old patient admitted with respiratory distress, 
      oxygen desaturation 65% while breathing ambient air and fever 38.5°C. Blood count 
      showed pancytopenia. Ionogram objectified slight hepatic cytolysis and chest X-ray 
      showed bilateral miliaria. BK research using sputum was negative as well as 
      Genexpert TB test. Anatomopathological examination of the osteomedullar biopsy 
      revealed epitheliogigantocellular granuloma without caseous necrosis and polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) showed mycobacterium tuberculosis in osteomedullary biopsy. 
      Liver biopsy showed epithelioid granuloma without caseous necrosis. The diagnosis of 
      multifocal tuberculosis with pulmonary, hematopoietic and hepatic impairment was 
      retained. Miliary Tuberculosis is a severe form of tuberculosis. Bacilloscopies are 
      often negative and the diagnosis can be retained based on other sampling, including 
      cerebrospinal fluid sampling and osteomedullary biopsy. Different kinds of biopsies 
      enable diagnosis in rare cases. PCR, a technique used in molecular biology, has 
      enabled to shorten the window period from disease onset to diagnosis as well as 
      treatment implementation. Miliary tuberculosis can be life-threatening; therefore, 
      sometimes, treatment must be administered before certain diagnosis.

TI  - Elevated pulmonary tuberculosis biomarker miR-423-5p plays critical role in the 
      occurrence of active TB by inhibiting autophagosome-lysosome fusion.
PG  - 448-460
LID - 10.1080/22221751.2019.1590129 [doi]
AB  - Rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is an effective measure to prevent the 
      spread of tuberculosis. However, the grim fact is that the new, rapid, and safe 
      methods for clinical diagnosis are lacking. Moreover, although auto-lysosome is 
      critical in clearing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathological signiﬁcance of 
      microRNAs, as biomarkers of tuberculosis, in autophagosome maturation is unclear. 
      Here, these microRNAs were investigated by Solexa sequencing and qPCR validation, 
      and a potential diagnostic model was established by logistic regression. Besides 
      that, the mechanism of one of the microRNAs involved in the occurrence of 
      tuberculosis was studied. The results showed that the expression of miR-423-5p, 
      miR-17-5p, and miR-20b-5p were signiﬁcantly increased in the serum of patients with 
      tuberculosis. The combination of these three microRNAs established a model to 
      diagnose tuberculosis with an accuracy of 78.18%, and an area under the curve value 
      of 0.908. Bioinformatics analysis unveiled miR-423-5p as the most likely candidate 
      in regulating autophagosome maturation. The up-regulation of miR-423-5p could 
      inhibit autophagosome maturation through suppressing autophagosome-lysosome fusion 
      in macrophages. Further investigations showed that VPS33A was the direct target of 
      miR-423-5p, and the two CUGCCCCUC domains in VPS33A 3'-UTR were the direct 
      regulatory sites for miR-423-5p. In addition, an inverse correlation between VPS33A 
      and miR-423-5p was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with 
      tuberculosis. Since the inhibition of autolysosome formation plays a critical role 
      in tuberculosis occurrence, our ﬁndings suggests that miR-423-5p could suppress 
      autophagosome-lysosome fusion by post-transcriptional regulation of VPS33A, which 
      might be important for the occurrence of active tuberculosis.

TI  - Diagnostic value of the urine lipoarabinomannan assay in HIV-positive, ambulatory 
      patients with CD4 below 200 cells/μl in 2 low-resource settings: A prospective 
      observational study.
PG  - e1002792
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002792 [doi]
LID - e1002792
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend the use of the lateral flow urine 
      lipoarabinomannan assay (LAM) in HIV-positive, ambulatory patients with signs and 
      symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) only if they are seriously ill or have CD4 count ≤ 100 
      cells/μl. We assessed the diagnostic yield of including LAM in TB diagnostic 
      algorithms in HIV-positive, ambulatory patients with CD4 < 200 cells/μl, as well as 
      the risk of mortality in LAM-positive patients who were not diagnosed using other 
      diagnostic tools and not treated for TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a 
      prospective observational study including HIV-positive adult patients with signs and 
      symptoms of TB and CD4 < 200 cells/μl attending 6 health facilities in Malawi and 
      Mozambique. Patients were included consecutively from 18 September 2015 to 27 
      October 2016 in Malawi and from 3 December 2014 to 22 August 2016 in Mozambique. All 
      patients had a clinical exam and LAM, chest X-ray, sputum microscopy, and Xpert 
      MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) requested. Culture in sputum was done for a subset of 
      patients. The diagnostic yield was defined as the proportion of patients with a 
      positive assay result among those with laboratory-confirmed TB. For the 456 patients 
      included in the study, the median age was 36 years (IQR 31-43) and the median CD4 
      count was 50 cells/μl (IQR 21-108). Forty-five percent (205/456) of the patients had 
      laboratory-confirmed TB. The diagnostic yields of LAM, microscopy, and Xpert were 
      82.4% (169/205), 33.7% (69/205), and 40.0% (84/205), respectively. In total, 50.2% 
      (103/205) of the patients with laboratory-confirmed TB were diagnosed only through 
      LAM. Overall, the use of LAM in diagnostic algorithms increased the yield of 
      algorithms with microscopy and with Xpert by 38.0% (78/205) and 34.6% (71/205), 
      respectively, and, specifically among patients with CD4 100-199 cells/μl, by 27.5% 
      (14/51) and 29.4% (15/51), respectively. LAM-positive patients not diagnosed through 
      other tools and not treated for TB had a significantly higher risk of mortality than 
      LAM-positive patients who received treatment (adjusted risk ratio 2.57, 95% CI 
      1.27-5.19, p = 0.009). Although the TB diagnostic conditions in the study sites were 
      similar to those in other resource-limited settings, the added value of LAM may 
      depend on the availability of microscopy or Xpert results. CONCLUSIONS: LAM has 
      diagnostic value for identifying TB in HIV-positive patients with signs and symptoms 
      of TB and advanced immunodeficiency, including those with a CD4 count of 100-199 
      cells/μl. In this study, the use of LAM enabled the diagnosis of TB in half of the 
      patients with confirmed TB disease; without LAM, these patients would have been 
      missed. The rapid identification and treatment of TB enabled by LAM may decrease 
      overall mortality risk for these patients.

TI  - Methylation status of alu repetitive elements in children with tuberculosis disease.
PG  - 242-246
LID - 10.4103/ijmy.ijmy_86_18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Investigation of DNA methylation in Alu repetitive elements (REs) was 
      shown to be a promising field to explore transcriptional changes in human genome 
      under disease condition. To scrutinize the association between Alu methylation and 
      tuberculosis (TB) disease in children, the difference in Alu DNA methylation level 
      was compared with healthy controls. METHODS: Whole-blood genomic DNA from 36 
      TB-infected children and 32 healthy controls was isolated, and the level of Alu 
      repeat DNA methylation was examined by methylation-specific polymerase chain 
      reaction. RESULTS: The median Alu methylation level in TB patients was 30% 
      (Interquartile range [IQR], 25-30%), whereas in healthy controls, it was 75% (IQR, 
      50-75%) (P < 0.0001). The median level of DNA methylation of Alu RE in TB cases was 
      significantly lower than healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve 
      analysis showed that the area under the curve for diagnosis was 0.969 (95% 
      confidence interval, 0.936-1) (P < 0.0001), with 100% sensitivity and 84% 
      specificity. CONCLUSION: Our results point out that detection of Alu DNA methylation 
      in whole-blood DNA may be clinically useful tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of 
      TB disease in children.

AB  - This paper demonstrates a new method for electrochemical detection of specific 
      sequences of DNA present in trace amounts in serum or blood. This method is designed 
      for use at the point-of-care (particularly in resource-limited settings). By 
      combining recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)- an isothermal alternative to 
      the polymerase chain reaction - with an electroactive mediator, this electrochemical 
      methodology enables accurate detection of DNA in the field using a low-cost, 
      portable electrochemical analyzer (specifically designed for this type of analysis). 
      This handheld device has four attributes: (1) It uses disposable, paper-based strips 
      that incorporate screen-printed carbon electrodes; (2) It accomplishes 
      thermoregulation with ±0.1 °C temperature accuracy; (3) It enables electrochemical 
      detection using a variety of pulse sequences, including square-wave and cyclic 
      voltammetry, and coulometry; (4) It is operationally simple to use. Detection of 
      genomic DNA from Mycobacterium smegmatis (a surrogate for M. tuberculosis-the main 
      cause of tuberculosis), and from M. tuberculosis itself down to ∼0.040 ng/μL 
      provides a proof-of-concept for the applicability of this method of screening for 
      disease using molecular diagnostics. With minor modifications to the reagents, this 
      method will also enable field monitoring of food and water quality.

AB  - Infectious meningitis may be due to bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal or viral 
      agents. Diagnosis of meningitis must take into account numerous items of patient 
      history and symptomatology along with regional epidemiology and basic cerebrospinal 
      fluid testing (protein, etc.) to allow the clinician to stratify the likelihood of 
      etiology possibilities and rationally select additional diagnostic tests. Culture is 
      the mainstay for diagnosis in many cases, but technology is evolving to provide more 
      rapid, reliable diagnosis. The cryptococcal antigen lateral flow assay 
      (Immuno-Mycologics) has revolutionized diagnosis of cryptococcosis and automated 
      nucleic acid amplification assays hold promise for improving diagnosis of bacterial 
      and mycobacterial meningitis. This review will focus on a holistic approach to 
      diagnosis of meningitis as well as recent technological advances.

AB  - Treatment efficacy is difficult to evaluate in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) 
      patients. Interferon-γ inducible protein (IP-)10 has been suggested as a biomarker 
      for response to treatment. We have investigated if IP-10 from dried plasma spots 
      (DPS) or dried blood spots (DBS) can be used in treatment monitoring of EPTB 
      patients in a low-resource setting of Zanzibar. IP-10 levels in plasma, DPS and DBS 
      samples collected before, during (2 months) and after TB treatment of 36 EPTB 
      patients (6 culture and/or Xpert MTB/RIF positive and 30 clinically diagnosed) and 8 
      pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients, were quantified by an enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. There was a high positive correlation between IP-10 measured in 
      plasma and DPS and DBS, respectively. We found a significant decline in IP-10 levels 
      from baseline to end of treatment in plasma, DPS and DBS, both in EPTB and PTB 
      patients. The declines were observed already after 2 months in HIV negative 
      patients. In conclusion, the DPS/DBS IP-10 assay allows for easy and manageable 
      monitoring in low-resource settings and our findings suggest that IP-10 may serve as 
      a biomarker for treatment efficacy in EPTB patients, albeit further studies in 
      cohorts of patients with treatment failure and relapse are needed.

AB  - Tuberculosis still represents a big global public health challenge. The diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis and the differentiation between active and latent tuberculosis remain 
      difficult, particularly in childhood, because of the lack of a gold standard test 
      for diagnosis. In the last decade, novel diagnostic assays have been developed. 
      Among immunologic tests, new assays based on the measurement of different cytokines 
      released by specific T cells in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens, 
      other than INF-γ, have been investigated. Promising results rely on nucleic acid 
      amplification techniques, also able to detect drugs resistance. Innovative research 
      fields studied the modifications of CD27 expression in T cells as well as different 
      host gene expression in response to M. tuberculosis. Further studies are needed to 
      assess the diagnostic value and the accuracy of these new assays.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality 
      in HIV-positive individuals, causing 1.1 million incident cases and 0.32 million 
      deaths in 2012. Diagnosis of TB is particularly challenging in HIV-coinfected 
      individuals, due to a high frequency of smear-negative disease, atypical 
      presentations, and extrapulmonary TB. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to 
      review the current literature on molecular diagnostics for TB with an emphasis on 
      the performance of these diagnostic tests in the HIV-positive population. METHODS: 
      We searched the PubMed database using at least one of the terms TB, HIV, 
      diagnostics, Xpert MTB/RIF, nucleic acid amplification tests, drug susceptibility 
      testing, RNA transcription, and drew on World Health Organization publications. 
      FINDINGS: With increased focus on reducing TB prevalence worldwide, a new set of 
      tools for diagnosing the disease have emerged. Molecular tools such as Xpert MTB/RIF 
      and line-probe assays are now in use or are being rolled out in many regions. The 
      diagnostic performance of these and other molecular assays are discussed here as 
      they pertain to the HIV-positive population. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular diagnostics 
      offer a useful addition and at times, alternative, to traditional culture methods 
      for the diagnosis of TB. However, most of these tests suffer from decreased accuracy 
      in the HIV-positive population.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tuberculosis (TB) risk might be increased in patients with 
      diabetes by factors other than hyperglycaemia, such as dyslipidaemia. Host lipids 
      are essential energy sources used by mycobacteria to persist in a latent TB state. A 
      potential therapy targeting cholesterol catabolism of mycobacteria has been 
      proposed, but the potential of cholesterol-lowering drugs as anti-TB therapy is 
      unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ezetimibe, a 
      2-azetidinone cholesterol absorption inhibitor, on intracellular mycobacteria 
      survival and dormancy. METHODS: Intracellular mycobacteria survival was determined 
      by measurements of ATP activity and colony-formation units (CFUs). Gene expression 
      profiles of hypoxia-induced dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) were analysed 
      by real-time PCR. Flow cytometry and microscopy analysis were used to measure the 
      lipid loads of human macrophages with or without ezetimibe treatment. QuantiFERON-TB 
      Gold In-Tube (QFT-G-IT) assays were performed to diagnose latent TB infection. The 
      levels of intracellular cholesterol/ triglyceride were measured by an enzymatic 
      fluorometric method. RESULTS: Ezetimibe was capable of effectively lowering 
      intracellular growth of Mtb and hypoxia-induced dormant Mtb. There was a significant 
      decrease in Mtb growth in leucocytes from ezetimibe-treated patients with diabetes 
      in terms of ATP levels of intracellular mycobacteria and CFU formation. Also, 
      patients receiving ezetimibe therapy had a lower prevalence of latent TB and had 
      lower intracellular lipid contents. CONCLUSION: Ezetimibe, which is a currently 
      marketed drug, could hold promise as an adjunctive, host-directed therapy for TB.

AB  - There is an urgent need for new tools to combat the ongoing tuberculosis (TB) 
      pandemic. Gene expression profiles based on blood signatures have proved useful in 
      identifying genes that enable classification of TB patients, but have thus far been 
      complex. Using real-time PCR analysis, we evaluated the expression profiles from a 
      large panel of genes in TB patients and healthy individuals in an Indian cohort. 
      Classification models were built and validated for their capacity to discriminate 
      samples from TB patients and controls within this cohort and on external independent 
      gene expression datasets. A combination of only four genes distinguished TB patients 
      from healthy individuals in both cross-validations and on separate validation 
      datasets with very high accuracy. An external validation on two distinct cohorts 
      using a real-time PCR setting confirmed the predictive power of this 4-gene tool 
      reaching sensitivity scores of 88% with a specificity of around 75%. Moreover, this 
      gene signature demonstrated good classification power in HIV(+) populations and also 
      between TB and several other pulmonary diseases. Here we present proof of concept 
      that our 4-gene signature and the top classifier genes from our models provide 
      excellent candidates for the development of molecular point-of-care TB diagnosis in 
      endemic areas.

AB  - In order to diagnose TB infection, tuberculin skin test and interferon gamma release 
      assay are available. The tuberculin test has a sensitivity of 99 % and a specificity 
      of 95 %. For the detection of interferon gamma in blood there are currently two 
      tests available: TBGold QuantiFERON-In-Tube (with a sensitivity of 0.70 and a 
      specificity of 0.90), and T-SPOT-TB (sensitivity 0.90 and specificity 0.93). To 
      diagnose the disease, a microscopy of direct smears for acid-fast bacilli is used if 
      the physician is facing an extensive cavitary lung disease due to M. tuberculosis 
      (this test has a high sensitivity: 80-90 %). The most common staining techniques 
      used are Ziehl-Neelsen and Kinyoun, and the fluorescent technique, 
      auramine-rhodamine. The culture is the gold standard and it has a sensitivity of 80 
      % and a specificity over 90 %, but the results take weeks. The nucleic acid 
      amplification test has an overall sensitivity and specificity of 0.85 and 0.97, 
      respectively. In the presence of a pleural effusion is necessary to perform a 
      pleural biopsy for culture with a sensitivity of 85 % if it is percutaneous and 98 % 
      if it was taken by thoracoscopy. The adenosine deaminase can be determined in 
      pleural fluid with a sensitivity and specificity of 95 %.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB), is becoming 
      increasingly recognized as an important cause of fatal chronic illnesses in China. 
      In this study, we report an infectious disease among 84 rhesus macaques at a Chinese 
      zoo. Their clinical signs and symptoms were very similar with the manifestations of 
      TB in humans. To determine the potential pathogens of this outbreak, many methods 
      were used. First, tuberculin skin tests showed that none of the monkeys displayed 
      significant skin reactions. Subsequently, the sera were tested for specific antibody 
      IgG; 29 (34.5%) and 39 (46.4%) blood samples tested positive by TB-IgG and TB-DOT, 
      respectively. Radiographic examination showed characteristic imageology changes in 
      14 (16.7%) monkeys. One individual determined as positive by the above three methods 
      was euthanized, and histopathological analysis demonstrated typical granulomas and 
      caseous necrosis in the lung, liver, spleen, and intestine. Furthermore, the 
      pathogenic mycobacteria were isolated from lung lobe, cultured on acidic 
      Lowenstein-Jensen culture medium, and identified as M. tuberculosis by real-time PCR 
      and DNA sequencing. Nevertheless, the origin of the infection remained unknown. 
      These findings emphasize the need to strengthen the management and training of 
      staff, especially those working at animal shelters.

TI  - Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis: recent advances.
PG  - 332-6
AB  - India continues to have the highest number of TB cases in the world, and over 2 
      million cases are reported in India every year. The private sector in India is an 
      important source of TB care with over 50% of TB patients seeking TB treatment in the 
      private health sector. Early and accurate diagnosis is the first critical step in 
      controlling TB. All persons with cough lasting two weeks or more, or with 
      unexplained chronic fever and/or weight loss should be evaluated for TB. For 
      pulmonary TB, Sputum is the most critical sample for laboratory testing. Although 
      blood is a popular sample in the Indian private sector, there is no accepted, valid 
      blood test for pulmonary TB. There are three accepted, validated sputum tests for 
      active TB: Sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli; molecular or nucleic acid 
      amplification test (NAAT); and culture. Chest radiography is useful but is not 
      specific for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. Therefore, chest radiography cannot 
      provide a conclusive diagnosis on its own, and needs to be followed by sputum 
      testing. If sputum smears and NAATs are negative, and TB is still suspected, 
      cultures are the most sensitive tests available for TB. Culture is therefore very 
      useful in diagnosing smear-negative TB; and drug-resistant TB. Blood-based antibody 
      tests (eg, IgG/IgM tests) and Interferon-gamma release assays (eg, TB Gold) are not 
      accurate and should not be used for pulmonary TB diagnosis. In fact, use of 
      serodiagnostic tests for TB is banned by the Government of India.

AB  - Bovine tuberculosis is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis 
      that affects cattle and can cause tuberculosis in a range of wildlife animals. A 
      bacteriophage-based method combined with PCR (phage-PCR) has been recently used to 
      detect and identify viable pathogenic mycobacteria in the peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of animals suffering from paratuberculosis. To adapt this 
      method for the detection of M. bovis in blood, a new isothermal DNA amplification 
      protocol using Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) was developed and was 
      found to be able to detect M. bovis BCG within 48 h, with a limit of detection of 
      approximately 10 cells per ml of blood for artificially inoculated blood samples. 
      When blood samples (2 ml) from a Single Comparative Cervical Intradermal Tuberculin 
      (SCCIT)- negative beef herd were tested, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) 
      cells were not detected from any (45) of the blood samples. However when blood 
      samples from SCCIT-positive animals were tested, viable MTC bacteria were detected 
      in 66 % (27/41) of samples. Of these 41 animals sampled, 32 % (13) had visible 
      lesions. In the visible lesion (VL) group, 85 % (11/13) had detectable levels of MTC 
      whereas only 57 % (16/28) of animals which had no visible lesions (NVL) were found 
      to have detectable mycobacteraemia. These results indicated that this simple, rapid 
      method can be applied for the study of M. bovis infections. The frequency with which 
      viable mycobacteria were detected in the peripheral blood of SCCIT-positive animals 
      changes the paradigm of this disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the ability of the Xpert(®) MTB/RIF assay to detect 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis in whole blood of children with tuberculosis in 
      tuberculosis endemic settings with high rates of HIV infection. METHODS: From June 
      2011 to September 2012 we prospectively enrolled children with symptoms or signs 
      suggestive of tuberculosis at three research centres in Tanzania and Uganda. After 
      clinical assessment, respiratory specimens were collected for microscopy and 
      culture, as well as whole blood for Xpert(®) MTB/RIF. Children were classified 
      according to standardised case definitions. RESULTS: A total of 232 children were 
      evaluated; 14 (6.0%) had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. The Xpert(®) MTB/RIF assay 
      detected M. tuberculosis in 5/232 (2.2%) blood samples with 1 (0.4%) error reading 
      and presumably 1 (0.4%) false-positive result. The sensitivity of the assay in 
      children with culture-confirmed (1/14) versus no tuberculosis (1/117) was 7.1% (95% 
      CI, 1.3-31.5). Three of the five Xpert(®) MTB/RIF positive patients had negative 
      cultures, but were classified as probable tuberculosis cases. Assay sensitivity 
      against a composite reference standard (culture-confirmed, highly probable or 
      probable tuberculosis) was 5.4% (95% CI, 2.1-13.1). CONCLUSION: Whole blood Xpert(®) 
      MTB/RIF demonstrated very poor sensitivity, although it may enhance the diagnostic 
      yield in select cases, with culture-negative tuberculosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is 
      essential for a positive outcome, but sensitive, specific, and rapid diagnostic 
      tests for TBM are lacking. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays in HIV-uninfected patients with suspected TBM. 
      METHODS: All HIV-uninfected patients with suspected TBM were prospectively enrolled 
      at a tertiary care hospital in an intermediate TB-burden country, during a 6-year 
      period. ELISPOT assays were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
      and cerebrospinal fluid-mononuclear cells (CSF-MC). RESULTS: Of the 276 evaluable 
      patients, 90 (33%) were classified as having TBM (30 definite cases, 19 probable, 
      and 41 possible), and 186 (67%) as having non-TBM. When comparing definite TBM 
      versus non-TBM, the sensitivity and specificity of the PBMC ELISPOT assay (≥6 spots; 
      manufacturer's recommended cut-off) for diagnosing TBM were 96% (95% CI, 82-100) and 
      58% (95% CI, 50-66), respectively. The CSF-MC ELISPOT assay (≥38 spots; receiver 
      operating characteristic [ROC]-derived cut-off) was a useful rule-in test with 
      specificity of 95% (96% CI, 90-98). Its sensitivity was 68% (95% CI, 45-86), which 
      was superior those of AFB smear microscopy (14%; P < 0.001) and CSF Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis PCR (41%; P = 0.07). Combining this assay with M. tuberculosis PCR, 
      clinical score, and both together increased sensitivity to 86%, 91%, and 95%, 
      respectively, while retaining about 95% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The CSF-MC ELISPOT 
      assay appears to be a rapid and accurate rule-in test for the diagnosis of TBM and a 
      useful adjunct for diagnosing TBM in HIV-uninfected patients.

AB  - Biomarkers are indispensable to the development of new tuberculosis therapeutics and 
      vaccines. The most robust biomarkers measure factors that are essential to the 
      underlying pathological process of the disease being treated, and thus can capture 
      the full effects of many types of interventions on clinical outcomes in multiple 
      prospective, randomised clinical trials. Many Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human 
      biomarkers have been studied over the past decade. Present research focuses on three 
      areas: biomarkers predicting treatment efficacy and cure of active tuberculosis, the 
      reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection, and the induction of protective 
      immune responses by vaccination. Many older, non-specific markers of inflammation, 
      when considered in isolation, do not have sufficient predictive values for clinical 
      use in tuberculosis. Although no new accurate, tuberculosis-specific biomarkers have 
      yet been discovered, substantial progress has been made in some areas. However, the 
      qualification of biomarkers as a surrogate for a clinical endpoint in tuberculosis 
      is very challenging, and, for biomarkers that are non-culture-based, impossible to 
      pursue without the availability of well characterised biobanks containing 
      biospecimens from patients who have had adequate follow-up to establish long-term 
      treatment outcome. We review progress in tuberculosis biomarker development and 
      efforts being made to harness resources to meet future challenges.

TI  - Severe BCG-osis Misdiagnosed as Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis in an 
      IL-12Rβ1-Deficient Peruvian Girl.
PG  - 712-716
LID - 10.1007/s10875-018-0535-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Mendelian suceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is a rare primary 
      immunodeficiency predisposing to severe disease caused by mycobacteria and other 
      intracellular pathogens. Delay in diagnosis can have an impact on the patient's 
      prognosis. METHODS: We evaluated the IFN-γ circuit by studying IFN-γ production 
      after mycobacterial challenge as well as IL-12Rβ1 expression and STAT4 
      phosphorylation in response to IL-12p70 stimulation in whole blood of a 6-year-old 
      Peruvian girl with disseminated recurrent mycobacterial infection diagnosed as 
      multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Genetic studies with Sanger sequencing were used 
      to identify the causative mutation. Microbiological studies based on PCR reactions 
      were used to diagnose the specific mycobacterial species. RESULTS: We identified a 
      homozygous mutation in the IL12RB1 gene (p. Arg211*) causing abolished expression of 
      IL-12Rβ1 and IL-12 response. MSMD diagnosis led to a microbiological reevaluation of 
      the patient, revealing a BCG vaccine-related infection instead of tuberculosis. 
      Treatment was then adjusted, with good response. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first 
      Peruvian patient with IL-12Rβ1 deficiency. Specific mycobacterial species diagnosis 
      within Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex is still challenging in countries with 
      limited access to PCR-based microbiological diagnostic techniques. Awareness of MSMD 
      warning signs and accurate microbiological diagnosis of mycobacterial infections are 
      of the utmost importance for optimal diagnosis and management of affected patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Simple methods for the accurate triaging and screening of HIV-associated 
      tuberculosis (TB) are urgently needed. We hypothesized that combining serum antibody 
      with urine lipoarabinomannan (U-LAM) detection can improve the detection of 
      HIV-associated TB. METHODS: We performed a case-control study with sampling from a 
      prospective study of South African HIV-infected subjects who were screened for TB 
      prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy. Sera from all available TB cases (n = 
      74) and randomly selected non-TB controls (n = 30), all tested for U-LAM, sputum 
      microscopy, GeneXpert, and cultures, were evaluated for antibodies to LAM and 
      arabinomannan (AM). Diagnostic logistic regression models for TB were developed 
      based on the primary test results and the additive effect of antibodies with 
      leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: Antibody responses to LAM and AM correlated 
      strongly (p<0.0001), and IgG and IgM reactivities were significantly higher in TB 
      than non-TB patients (p<0.0001). At 80% specificity, the target specificity for a 
      non-sputum-based simple triage/screening test determined by major TB stakeholders, 
      combining U-LAM with IgG detection significantly increased the sensitivity for 
      HIV-associated TB to 92% compared to 30% for U-LAM alone (p<0.001). Sputum 
      microscopy combined with IgG detection increased sensitivity to 88% compared to 31% 
      for microscopy alone, and Xpert with IgG increased sensitivity to 96% and 99% 
      compared to 57% for testing one, and 70% for testing two sputa with Xpert alone, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Combining U-LAM with serum antibody detection could 
      provide a simple low-cost method that meets the requirements for a non-sputum-based 
      test for the screening of HIV-associated TB.

AB  - Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is diagnosed immunologically using the Mantoux 
      tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). While widely 
      used, immunodiagnostics can produce false negative or false positive results. 
      Pathogen biomarkers provide an alternative, but direct detection in LTBI and 
      extrapulmonary TB cases is challenging. Mycobacterium tuberculosis grows slowly, has 
      limited hematogenous movement, is protected by a lipid rich cell wall, and produces 
      low levels of secreted factors. Here we discuss the potential of elicitors by first 
      considering pathogen markers that may be released following the administration of 
      isoniazid. Isoniazid targets the cell wall of mycobacteria found in extracellular 
      compartments and within monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphatic 
      endothelial cells. Isoniazid's dual-purpose potential as an antibiotic and elicitor 
      is supported by knowledge of latent infection dynamics, time-kill kinetics, and new 
      detection techniques. Within hours, the bactericidal action of isoniazid likely 
      enriches plasma with M. tuberculosis DNA, RNA, proteins/peptides, and lipids. 
      Undoubtedly a portion of these biomarkers are eliminated as some bacilli undergo 
      phagocytosis and lysosomal destruction. However, advances in immunoprecipitation and 
      nucleic acid amplification, combined with the use of larger blood volumes during 
      assay development, may overcome these losses. Other anticipated challenges include 
      determining optimal sample collection times and designing diagnostic workflows that 
      minimize processing-associated marker loss and degradation. Conventional, 
      commercial, and emerging technologies that address these variables are discussed. If 
      realized, isoniazid associated markers could provide proof of concept for novel 
      elicitor-based diagnostic approaches capable of confirming LTBI and empirically 
      treated extrapulmonary TB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, studies on the diagnostic accuracy of in-house 
      real-time PCR (hRT-PCR) assay for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) 
      have been reported with unignorable discrepancies. To assess the overall accuracy of 
      the hRT-PCR assay for Mtb diagnosis in different samples for individuals with active 
      pulmonary and extra-pulmonary Mtb infection, a systematic review and meta-analysis 
      were performed. METHODS: The PUBMED, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases 
      were searched up to June 2017 for eligible studies that estimated diagnostic 
      sensitivity and specificity with the hRT-PCR assay in respiratory and 
      non-respiratory samples in pulmonary and extra-pulmonary Mtb infection patients, 
      with Mtb culture as the reference standard. Bivariate random effect models were used 
      to provide pooled estimation of diagnostic accuracy. Further, subgroup and 
      meta-regression analyses were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity. The 
      risk of bias was assessed by the QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS: Of the 3589 candidate 
      studies, 18 eligible studies met our inclusion criteria. Compared to Mtb culture 
      data, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.96 and 0.92, respectively. The 
      diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 192.96 (95% CI 68.46, 543.90), and the area under 
      the summary ROC curve (AUC) was 0.9791. There was significant heterogeneity in 
      sensitivity and specificity among the enrolled studies (p < 0.001). The studies with 
      high-quality assessment and application of respiratory specimen were associated with 
      better accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: In low-income/high-burden settings, our results 
      suggested that the hRT-PCR assay could be a useful test for the diagnosis of TB with 
      high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - HIV-1 co-infection is a leading cause of susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB), with 
      the risk of TB being increased at all stages of HIV-1 infection. Antiretroviral 
      treatment (ART) is the most effective way to reduce the risk of TB in HIV-1 
      co-infected people. Studying protective, ART-induced, immune restoration in HIV-1 
      infected individuals sensitised by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can thus help 
      identify mechanisms of protection against TB. In order to understand ART-mediated 
      prevention of TB in HIV-1 infected adults, we investigated the expression of 30 
      genes in whole blood from HIV-1 infected patients during the first 6 months of 
      ART-induced immune reconstitution. The 30 selected genes were previously described 
      to be differentially expressed between sorted Mtb specific central and effector 
      memory CD4 T cells. HIV-1 infected persons sensitised by Mtb were recruited in 
      Khayelitsha, South Africa, when initiating ART. RNA was extracted from whole blood 
      at initiation and 1, 3 and 6 months of ART. qRT-PCR was used to determine gene 
      expression and three reference 'housekeeping' genes were used to calculate the fold 
      change in the expression of each gene relative to day 0 of ART. Results were 
      assessed longitudinally. We observed a decrease in the expression of a number of 
      genes at 6 months of ART, reflecting a decrease in immune activation. However, 
      following correction for multiple comparisons and increasing CD4 counts, only the 
      decrease in CD27 gene expression remained statistically significant. While not 
      statistically significant, a number of genes also showed increased expression at 
      various timepoints, illustrating the broad regeneration of the T cell pool in HIV-1 
      infected adults on ART. Our findings generate hypotheses underlying ART- induced 
      protective immune reconstitution and may pave the way for future studies to evaluate 
      ART mediated prevention of TB in HIV-1 infected persons.

AB  - Bacterial small RNA (sRNA) has been shown to play an important role in control of 
      bacteria virulence, stress response and physiological metabolism by 
      post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. However, there were few reports 
      about bacterial sRNA as a biomarker of infection. To test the potential role of sRNA 
      in indicating infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, total RNA were extracted from 
      the filtrated bacterial cultural supernatant. After synthesis of cDNA by reverse 
      transcription, four Mycobacterial sRNAs including ASdes, ASpks, AS1726, and AS1890, 
      which have been experimentally confirmed by Kristine B in the year of 2009, were 
      detected by real time PCR. The specificity was verified by sequencing of the 
      amplified products. Moreover, we demonstrate that the presence of sRNA Asdes in 
      plasma of 55.56% (15/27) TB patients and 25.00% (6/24) normal controls with BCG 
      vaccination (P < 0.05). Our results suggest that bacterial non-coding sRNA can be 
      detected from either bacterial culture supernatants or patient's plasma. Detecting 
      of Mycobacterial sRNA provides a rapid and relatively noninvasive approach for 
      diagnosing disease and could be developed as a biomarker to identify patients with 
      active tuberculosis to help make informed decisions about proper therapies.(1).

AB  - Since after the first streptomycin 1944 trials, anti-tuberculous chemotherapy 
      research has been focused upon establishing drug combination regimens capable of 
      overcoming drug resistance and amenable to ambulatory treatment in resource strapped 
      countries. The first milestone being the 1959 Madras trial comparing home and 
      sanatorium treatment in South India. Subsequently, the MRC trials led Fox and 
      Mitchison to indicate rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide as the first line drugs 
      for short course, 6 month, regimens and the 1982 Hong Kong Chest Service trials 
      established intermittent therapy as the ambulatory treatment standard for directly 
      observed therapy (DOT). The rising of the HIV epidemic at the beginning of the 1980s 
      has refuelled tuberculosis spread in Africa and Asia and contributed to the 
      expansion of drug-resistant tuberculosis worldwide making the development of new 
      drugs and drug regimens for ambulatory treatment a top priority. Led by 
      biotechnological advances, molecular biology has been brought into TB laboratory 
      diagnosis for the highly sensitive and specific rapid identification of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis in biological samples. The field of immunological 
      diagnosis of TB infection, dominated since the early 1900s by the intradermal 
      tuberculin reaction has been put back in motion by the discovery of M. 
      tuberculosis-specific proteins and peptides, now employed in blood tests of high 
      sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of latent TB which may help with the 
      identification of contacts at higher risk of active disease and the eradication of 
      epidemic cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptom-based screening for tuberculosis is recommended for all people 
      living with HIV. This recommendation results in unnecessary Xpert MTB/RIF testing in 
      many individuals living in tuberculosis-endemic areas and thus poor implementation 
      of intensified case finding and tuberculosis preventive therapy. Novel approaches to 
      tuberculosis screening are needed to help achieve global targets for tuberculosis 
      elimination. We assessed the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP) measured with a 
      point-of-care assay as a screening tool for active pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: 
      For this prospective study, we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years) living with HIV with 
      CD4 cell count less than or equal to 350 cells per μL who were initiating 
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) from two HIV/AIDS clinics in Uganda. CRP concentrations 
      were measured at study entry with a point-of-care assay using whole blood obtained 
      by fingerprick (concentration ≥10 mg/L defined as screen positive for tuberculosis). 
      Sputum samples were collected for Xpert MTB/RIF testing and culture. We calculated 
      the sensitivity and specificity of point-of-care CRP and WHO symptom-based screening 
      in reference to culture results. We repeated the sensitivity analysis with Xpert 
      MTB/RIF as the reference standard. FINDINGS: Between July 8, 2013, and Dec 15, 2015, 
      1237 HIV-infected adults were enrolled and underwent point-of-care CRP testing. 60 
      (5%) patients with incomplete or contaminated cultures were excluded from the 
      analysis. Of the remaining 1177 patients (median CD4 count 165 cells per μL [IQR 
      75-271]), 163 (14%) had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Point-of-care CRP testing 
      had 89% sensitivity (145 of 163, 95% CI 83-93) and 72% specificity (731 of 1014, 95% 
      CI 69-75) for culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Compared with WHO symptom-based 
      screening, point-of-care CRP testing had lower sensitivity (difference -7%, 95% CI 
      -12 to -2; p=0·002) but substantially higher specificity (difference 58%, 95% CI 55 
      to 61; p<0·0001). When Xpert MTB/RIF results were used as the reference standard, 
      sensitivity of point-of-care CRP and WHO symptom-based screening were similar (94% 
      [79 of 84] vs 99% [83 of 84], respectively; difference -5%, 95% CI -12 to 2; 
      p=0·10). INTERPRETATION: The performance characteristics of CRP support its use as a 
      tuberculosis screening test for people living with HIV with CD4 count less than or 
      equal to 350 cells per μL who are initiating ART. HIV/AIDS programmes should 
      consider point-of-care CRP-based tuberculosis screening to improve the efficiency of 
      intensified case finding and increase uptake of tuberculosis preventive therapy.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a devastating and 
      terminal disease in non-human primates (NHPs). Regular TB screenings using the 
      intradermal tuberculin test (TST) have been the mainstay of TB surveillance and 
      control in NHPs. Historically, Aotus monkeys have been considered less susceptible 
      to TB than other NHPs. Here we present the diagnosis and epidemiology of a TB 
      outbreak at The Gorgas Memorial Institute Aotus colony in Panama, and the results of 
      two cross-sectional randomized TB screening studies, using antibody (Ab) and 
      IFN-gamma release assay testing. RESULTS: Epidemiological and spatial analysis 
      confirmed that the outbreak was the result of a continuing intermittent exposure, 
      with human to monkey transmission as the most likely source. During the outbreak 
      that lasted five months (January-June 2015), Mycobacterium kansassi and MTB were 
      isolated from lung caseous granulomas in 1/7 and 3/7 TB suspicious animals 
      respectively. Furthermore, MTB was detected by qRT-PCR in formalin fixed lung and 
      liver granulomas in 2/7 and 1/6 monkeys respectively, suggesting an aerosol route of 
      infection. Likewise, a random sample that included 63 / 313 adult (>2 year-old) 
      monkeys, screened for latent TB with the Primagam® IFN-gamma release assay, between 
      March-May, 2016, were all non-reactors; indicating that the outbreak was 
      self-limiting and the colony was likely free or latent TB infection. Control 
      measures included, quarantine, disinfection and TST screening of all personnel. In 
      conclusion, this study demonstrates that Aotus are highly susceptible to TB, 
      therefore, TB prevention measures should be strictly enforced in Aotus monkey 
      colonies.

AB  - The goal of this study was to identify a host gene signature that can distinguish 
      tuberculosis (TB) from other pulmonary diseases (OPD). We conducted real-time PCR on 
      whole blood samples from patients in Brazil. TB and OPD patients (asthma and non-TB 
      pneumonia) differentially expressed granzyme A (GZMA), guanylate binding protein 5 
      (GBP5) and Fc gamma receptor 1A (CD64). Receiver operating characteristic, tree 
      classification and random forest analyses were applied to evaluate the 
      discriminatory power of the three genes and find the gene panel most predictive of 
      patients' disease classification. Tree classification produced a model based on GBP5 
      and CD64 expression. In random forest analysis, the combination of the three genes 
      provided a robust biosignature to distinguish TB from OPD with 95% specificity and 
      93% sensitivity. Our results suggest that GBP5 and CD64 in tandem may be the most 
      predictive combination. However, GZMA contribution to the prediction model requires 
      further investigation. Regardless, these three genes show promise as a rapid 
      diagnostic marker separating TB from OPD.

TI  - [Overexpression of miR-125b promotes apoptosis of macrophages].
PG  - 958-62
AB  - Objective To investigate the expressions of miR-125b and target gene Raf1 
      proto-oncogene serine/threonine protein kinase (RAF1) in peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of pediatric patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), 
      and observe the regulation of miR-125b on macrophage apoptosis and activity. Methods 
      PBMCs of patients with PTB and healthy children were collected and separated. 
      Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect mRNA expression level of 
      miR-125b and RAF1, and Western blotting was used to detect the protein level of 
      RAF1. THP-1 macrophages were transfected into miR-125b mimic, negative control mimic 
      (NC-mimic), miR-125b inhibitor and negative control inhibitor (NC-inhibitor), which 
      were cultured for 48 hours. Western blotting was performed to observe the expression 
      of RAF1 in THP-1 macrophages, annexin V-FITC/PI double staining combined with flow 
      cytometry was used to test cell apoptosis, and CCK-8 assay was used to detect cell 
      proliferation. Results The expression of miR-125b in PBMCs in pediatric patients 
      with PTB was downregulated, and mRNA and protein levels of RAF1 were upregulated. 
      When miR-125b was over-expressed in THP-1 macrophages, the expression of RAF1 was 
      reduced to promote the apoptosis of macrophages and decrease cell activity; when the 
      expression of miR-125b was inhibited in THP-1 macrophages, the expression of RAF1 
      was elevatedand the apoptosis of macrophages was inhibited, the cell activity was 
      promoted. Conclusion In PBMCs of children with PTB, miR-125b level is low. 
      Upregulation of miR-125b in THP-1 macrophages, the apoptosis of THP-1 macrophages is 
      promoted and cell activity is inhibited.

AB  - Tuberculosis remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases. Limitations 
      in the current diagnosis tools have heavily slowed down the step to eliminate TB. 
      The objective of this study was to identify potential circulating miRNA associated 
      with tuberculosis (TB) infection and disease development. Agilent human miRNA 
      microarray was used to estimate the circulating levels of 1887 miRNAs among 34 study 
      participants (10 patients with pulmonary TB, 13 controls with latent TB infection 
      and 11 non-infected healthy controls). The identified miRNAs were subsequently 
      verified by real-time qPCR. Target gene prediction and miRNA-gene network 
      construction were further explored. A total of 119 miRNAs were identified to be in 
      different levels between any two groups of the study population by microarray (Fold 
      Change>2, p < 0.01). 11 most promising miRNAs were then selected for verification by 
      real-time qPCR. The levels of hsa-let-7b-5p and hsa-miR-30b-5p were confirmed to be 
      significantly up-regulated in pulmonary TB patients as compared to both control 
      groups (p < 0.01). Caspase 3 was predicted to be one common target gene for these 
      two miRNAs. None of the selected miRNA was confirmed to be related with the 
      infection status. This pilot study suggested circulating hsa-let-7b and hsa-miR-30b 
      might be associated with TB development by regulating the target genes involved in 
      TLR-NF-kB mediated signal pathway.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The World Health Organization identified the need for a non-sputum-based 
      triage test to identify those in need of further tuberculosis (TB) testing. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the 3-gene TB score can be a diagnostic tool 
      throughout the course of TB disease, from latency to diagnosis to treatment 
      response, and posttreatment residual inflammation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This nested case-control study analyzed the 3-gene TB score in 3 
      cohorts, each focusing on a different stage of TB disease: (1) the Adolescent Cohort 
      Study profiled whole-blood samples from adolescents with latent Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis infection, some of which progressed to active TB (ATB), using RNA 
      sequencing; (2) the Brazil Active Screen Study collected whole blood from an 
      actively screened case-control cohort of adult inmates from 2 prisons in Mato Grosso 
      do Sul, Brazil, for ATB from January 2016 to February 2016; and (3) the Catalysis 
      Treatment Response Cohort (CTRC) identified culture-positive adults in primary 
      health care clinics in Cape Town, South Africa, from 2005 to 2007 and collected 
      whole blood for RNA sequencing from patients with ATB at diagnosis and weeks 1, 4, 
      and 24. The CTRC patients also had positron emission tomography-computed tomography 
      scans at diagnosis, week 4, and week 24. Analyses were performed from September 2017 
      to June 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A 3-gene messenger RNA expression score, 
      measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction or RNA sequencing, was evaluated 
      for distinguishing the following: individuals who progressed to ATB from those who 
      did not, individuals with ATB from those without, and individuals with slower 
      treatment response during TB therapy. RESULTS: Patients evaluated in this study 
      included 144 adolescents from the Adolescent Cohort Study (aged 12-18 years; 96 
      female and 48 male), 81 adult prison inmates from the Brazil Active Screen Study 
      (aged 20-72 years; 81 male), and 138 adult community members from the CTRC (aged 
      17-64 years; 81 female and 57 male). The 3-gene TB score identified progression from 
      latent M tuberculosis infection to ATB 6 months prior to sputum conversion with 86% 
      sensitivity and 84% specificity (area under the curve [AUC], 0.86; 95% CI, 
      0.77-0.96) and patients with ATB in the Brazil Active Screen Study cohort (AUC, 
      0.87; 95% CI, 0.78-0.95) and CTRC (AUC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.88-0.99). It also identified 
      CTRC patients with failed treatment at the end of treatment (AUC, 0.93; 95% CI, 
      0.83-1.00). Collectively, across all cohorts, the 3-gene TB score identified 
      patients with ATB with 90% sensitivity, 70% specificity, and 99.3% negative 
      predictive value at 4% prevalence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Across 3 independent 
      prospective cohorts, the 3-gene TB score approaches the World Health Organization 
      target product profile benchmarks for non-sputum-based triage test with high 
      negative predictive value. This gene expression diagnostic approach should be 
      considered for further validation and future implementation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection is a global health problem. 
      Failure to accurately identify cases of active MTB has serious effects on both 
      patients and the community. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear has poor sensitivity and 
      culture methods have a delay ranging from 1 to 8 weeks for diagnosis. Nucleic acid 
      amplification assays may be suitable candidates for this purpose. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: In a prospective study, we evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in 
      peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in 190 patients with pulmonary and extra 
      pulmonary tuberculosis whom were admitted to Tehran Imam Khomeini hospitals during 
      2006-2010. Three ml citrated blood samples were obtained from cases. DNA extraction 
      was performed by QIAGEN commercial kit and PCR performed with IS1081 Primer. 
      RESULTS: Fifty six cases had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and 134 were pulmonary. 
      Overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 41.1% and 95.5%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MTB-PCR assay on PBMC using IS1081 primer has a low 
      sensitivity and now can not use as a single or alternative diagnostic test for 
      tuberculosis. However, with regard to its high specificity can use for help 
      diagnosing of TB in cases have no enough sputum (or other specimens) to examination 
      for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture.

TI  - The Role of Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Count Ratio in the Differential Diagnosis of 
      Pulmonary Tuberculosis and Bacterial Community-Acquired Pneumonia: a Cross-Sectional 
      Study at Ayder and Mekelle Hospitals, Ethiopia.
LID - 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2018.180833 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The differential diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis and bacterial 
      community-acquired pneumonia is often a challenging phenomenon. The neutrophil to 
      lymphocyte count ratio, a suitable indicator of inflammation, has been demonstrated 
      to be a useful biomarker for predicting bacteremia. The main aim this study is to 
      evaluate the role of neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio in the differential 
      diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis and bacterial Community-Acquired Pneumonia at 
      Ayder and Mekelle hospitals, Mekelle, Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital based 
      cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2017 on a total of 146 
      patients at Ayder and Mekelle hospitals. After taking written informed consent, 
      study participants were interviewed for a detailed history and 5 mL of blood was 
      collected for hematological analysis. Pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed by using 
      Ziehl-Neelsen and Gene X-pert. Community acquired pneumonia was diagnosed using 
      sputum culture. Student's t-test, Pearson's chi-square test, and receiver operating 
      characteristics curve analysis were used. A p-value < 0.05 was considered 
      statistically significant. RESULTS: The neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio and 
      eythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly higher in pulmonary tuberculosis 
      patients than bacterial community-acquired pneumonia patients. Neutrophil to 
      lymphocyte count ratio and eythrocyte sedimentation rate with cutoff values of ≥ 
      2.72 and ≥ 39, respectively, showed the highest area under the curve (AUC = 0.69; 
      95% CI: 0.62, 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio and 
      eythrocyte sedimentation rate together at a time with their respective cutoff values 
      gave a 69% accuracy in differentiating pulmonary tuberculosis from bacterial 
      community-acquired pneumonia. Therefore, neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio and 
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be used in differentiating pulmonary tuberculosis 
      from PTB patients from bacterial Community-acquired pneumonia, especially in 
      resource-limited settings.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a public health emergency, compounded by the lack 
      of adequate diagnostic testing in many regions of the world. New advances in the 
      molecular detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including faster and simpler 
      nucleic acid amplification tests, have resulted in rapid and cost-effective methods 
      to diagnose TB and test for drug resistance. Ongoing research on biomarkers for TB 
      infection may lead to new tests for blood, urine, breath, and sputum. Sustained 
      investment in the development and dissemination of diagnostic tests for TB is 
      critical for increasing TB case finding, placing patients on appropriate treatment, 
      and reducing transmission.

      Hospitals in Uganda.

AB  - Understanding risk factors for tuberculosis (TB) and their prevalence helps guide 
      early diagnosis. We determined their prevalence among bacteriologically negative and 
      bacteriologically confirmed TB patients in five regional referral hospitals in 
      Uganda. This cross-sectional study considered 1,862 adult presumptive TB 
      participants. We performed fluorescent microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), 
      Lowenstein-Jensen culture, human immunodeficiency virus, and random blood sugar 
      testing on recruited patients. Prevalence and prevalence ratios of risk factors were 
      compared among bacteriologically negative and confirmed cases. Odds ratios and 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) were determined for significant risk factors in 
      bacteriologically confirmed patients. Of the 1,862 participants, 978 (55%) were male 
      and the median age of the participants was 36 years (interquartile range: 27-48). Up 
      to 273 (15%) had a positive result on all three TB tests. Most prevalent risk 
      factors (prevalence ratio [PR] > 1.0) among bacteriologically negative and positive 
      TB patients were cigarette smoking (9.3% versus 2.1%; PR = 2.1), biosmoke (24% 
      versus 39.7%; PR = 1.7), contact (4.2% versus 6.5%; PR = 1.6), male gender (51.4% 
      versus 72.5%; PR = 1.4), alcohol use (17.2% versus 24.4%; PR = 1.4), diabetes (0.7% 
      versus 0.9%; PR = 1.3), and family history of TB (12.1% versus 13.7%; PR = 1.1). The 
      risk factors and their adjusted prevalence rate ratios (95% CI) of being 
      bacteriologically positive were male (1.8 [1.4-2.4]), biosmoke exposure (1.5 
      [1.2-2.0]), and history of cigarette smoking (1.6 [1.1-2.4]). Among 
      bacteriologically confirmed patients in Uganda, cigarette smoking, biosmoke 
      exposure, contact, male gender, alcohol use, diabetes, and family history of TB are 
      important risk factors for TB. Interventions for TB control in people with these 
      risk factors would help in TB control efforts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eales' disease is an idiopathic retinal vasculitis characterized by 
      retinal inflammation, ischemia, and neo-vascularisation. It frequently causes 
      massive vitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment leading to blindness. Although 
      the exact etiology is unknown, this condition is considered to be a consequence of 
      hypersensitivity reaction to tubercular protein due to previous Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection. This study is aimed at the detection of 
      association of M. tuberculosis in patients with Eales' disease. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A prospective case-control study was undertaken in 65 clinically diagnosed 
      cases of Eales' disease. Patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, 
      neo-vascular proliferation, macular oedema, premacular fibrosis and tractional 
      retinal detachment were taken as controls. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected (MPT64 
      gene by polymerase chain reaction, PCR) in patients with Eales' disease. Clinical 
      symptoms along with tuberculin skin test (TST) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
      (ESR) were used as gold standard for comparing results of PCR. RESULT: PCR 
      positivity was found in 12 (38.7%) patients with Eales' disease. The PCR positivity 
      was significantly associated with the patients with high TST reading and high ESR 
      values. CONCLUSION: Patients with a high TST reading and ESR value and a positive 
      PCR in vitreous samples have a high likelihood of having M. tuberculosis as an 
      etiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF 
      for tuberculous pericarditis (TBP) using pericardial tissues. METHODS: The study 
      involved 30 patients admitted with suspected TBP from January-December 2016; three 
      patients were later excluded. The interferon-γ release assay (T-SPOT.TB) and the 
      Xpert MTB/RIF test were performed using peripheral blood and pericardial tissues, 
      respectively. TBP was confirmed using pericardial histopathology and a composite 
      reference standard (CRS). We analyzed the sensitivity, specificity, predictive value 
      (PV), likelihood ratio (LR), and area under curve (AUC) of both assays. RESULTS: 
      Fourteen patients were confirmed as TBP, 10 as non-TBP, and 3 as probable TBP. The 
      sensitivity, specificity, positive PV (PPV), negative PV (NPV), PLR, NLR, and AUC 
      (95% confidence interval [CI]) of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay were 78.6% (49.2-95.3%) 
      and 70.6% (44.0-89.7%); 92.3% (64.0-99.8%) and 100% (69.2-100%); 91.7% (61.5-99.8%) 
      and 100% (73.5-100%); 80.0% (51.9-95.7%) and 66.7% (38.4-88.2%); 10.21 (1.52-68.49) 
      and the PLR value was undefined with CRS as the reference; 0.23 (0.08-0.64) and 
      0.29(0.14-0.61); and 0.854 (0.666-0.959) and 0.853 (0.664-0.959), against 
      histopathology and CRS, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, PLR, 
      NLR, and AUC values (95% CI) of T-SPOT.TB were 92.9% (66.1-99.8%) and 94.1% 
      (71.3-99.9%); 15.4% (1.9-45.5%) and 20.0% (2.5-55.6%); 54.2% (32.8-74.5%) and 66.7% 
      (44.7-84.4%); 66.7% (9.4-99.2%) and 66.7% (9.4-99.2%); 1.10 (0.83-1.44) and 1.18 
      (0.84-1.6); 0.46 (0.05-4.53) and 0.29 (0.03-2.85); and 0.541(0.340-0.733) and 
      0.571(0.367-0.758), against histopathology and CRS, respectively. The differences in 
      sensitivity, PPV, and AUC of Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT.TB were not statistically 
      significant (P > 0.05), compared to those of histopathology and CRS. However, the 
      differences in specificity and NPV of the two assays were significant (P < 0.05), 
      compared to those of histopathology and CRS. CONCLUSIONS: Xpert MTB/RIF test is a 
      valid diagnostic technique for TBP with higher sensitivity and specificity than 
      T-SPOT.TB.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major worldwide health problem and has caused millions 
      of deaths in the past few years. Current diagnostic methods, such as sputum smear 
      microscopy and sputum culture, are time-consuming and cannot prevent the rapid 
      spreading of TB during the diagnostic period. In this connection, detecting 
      biomarkers specific to TB at molecular level in plasma of patients will provide a 
      rapid means for diagnosis. In this study, we first evaluated the differential 
      expression of the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the plasma from patients with TB 
      (TB positive), community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthy individuals (CG) using 
      lncRNA microarray scanning. It was found that there were 2116 specific lncRNAs 
      differentially expressed in the TB positive samples (1102 up-regulated and 1014 
      down-regulated), which accounted for 6.96% of total lncRNAs. Twelve differentially 
      expressed lncRNAs discovered in microarray were subsequently validated by using 
      real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Two lncRNAs (ENST00000354432 and 
      ENST00000427151) were further validated with more Tuberculosis samples. These 
      results suggested the expression level of lncRNAs and the two validated lncRNAs in 
      plasma could be the potential molecular biomarkers for the rapid diagnosis of 
      Tuberculosis.

AB  - In human tuberculosis (TB) neutrophils represent the most commonly infected 
      phagocyte but their role in protection and pathology is highly contradictory. 
      Moreover, a subset of low-density neutrophils (LDNs) has been identified in TB, but 
      their functions remain unclear. Here, we have analyzed total neutrophils and their 
      low-density and normal-density (NDNs) subsets in patients with active TB disease, in 
      terms of frequency, phenotype, functional features, and gene expression signature. 
      Full-blood counts from Healthy Donors (H.D.), Latent TB infected, active TB, and 
      cured TB patients were performed. Frequency, phenotype, burst activity, and 
      suppressor T cell activity of the two different subsets were assessed by flow 
      cytometry while NETosis and phagocytosis were evaluated by confocal microscopy. 
      Expression analysis was performed by using the semi-quantitative RT-PCR array 
      technology. Elevated numbers of total neutrophils and a high neutrophil/lymphocyte 
      ratio distinguished patients with active TB from all the other groups. PBMCs of 
      patients with active TB disease contained elevated percentages of LDNs compared with 
      those of H.D., with an increased expression of CD66b, CD33, CD15, and CD16 compared 
      to NDNs. Transcriptomic analysis of LDNs and NDNs purified from the peripheral blood 
      of TB patients identified 12 genes differentially expressed: CCL5, CCR5, CD4, IL10, 
      LYZ, and STAT4 were upregulated, while CXCL8, IFNAR1, NFKB1A, STAT1, TICAM1, and TNF 
      were downregulated in LDNs, as compared to NDNs. Differently than NDNs, LDNs failed 
      to phagocyte live Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) bacilli, to make 
      oxidative burst and NETosis, but caused significant suppression of antigen-specific 
      and polyclonal T cell proliferation which was partially mediated by IL-10. These 
      insights add a little dowel of knowledge in understanding the pathogenesis of human 
      TB.

AB  - Tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS) 
      frequently complicates combined antiretroviral therapy and antituberculosis therapy 
      in HIV-1-coinfected tuberculosis patients. The immunopathological mechanisms 
      underlying TB-IRIS are incompletely defined, and improved understanding is required 
      to derive new treatments and to reduce associated morbidity and mortality. We 
      performed longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of human PBMCs from paradoxical 
      TB-IRIS patients and non-IRIS controls (HIV-TB-coinfected patients commencing 
      antiretroviral therapy who did not develop TB-IRIS). Freshly isolated PBMC 
      stimulated with heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (hkH37Rv) were used for 
      IFN-γ ELISPOT and RNA extraction. Stored RNA was used for microarray and RT-PCR, 
      whereas corresponding stored culture supernatants were used for ELISA. Stored PBMC 
      were used for perforin and granzyme B ELISPOT and flow cytometry. There were 
      significantly increased IFN-γ responses to hkH37Rv in TB-IRIS, compared with 
      non-IRIS PBMC (p = 0.035). Microarray analysis of hkH37Rv-stimulated PBMC indicated 
      that perforin 1 was the most significantly upregulated gene, with granzyme B among 
      the top five (log2 fold difference 3.587 and 2.828, respectively), in TB-IRIS. 
      Downstream experiments using RT-PCR, ELISA, and ELISPOT confirmed the increased 
      expression and secretion of perforin and granzyme B. Moreover, granzyme B secretion 
      reduced in PBMC from TB-IRIS patients during corticosteroid treatment. Invariant NKT 
      cell (CD3(+)Vα24(+)) proportions were higher in TB-IRIS patients (p = 0.004) and 
      were a source of perforin. Our data implicate the granule exocytosis pathway in 
      TB-IRIS pathophysiology. Further understanding of the immunopathogenesis of this

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) is emerging as a more serious pathogen due to the 
      increased multidrug-resistant TB and co-infection of human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV). The development of an effective and sensitive detection method is urgently 
      needed for bacterial load evaluation in vaccine development, early TB diagnosis, and 
      TB treatment. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a newly developed 
      sensitive PCR method for the absolute quantification of nucleic acid concentrations. 
      Here, we used ddPCR to quantify the circulating virulent M. tb-specific CFP10 
      (10-kDa culture filtrate protein, Rv3874) and Rv1768 DNA copy numbers in the blood 
      samples from Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-vaccinated and/or virulent M. tb 
      H37Rv-challenged rhesus monkeys. We found that ddPCR was more sensitive compared to 
      real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR), as the detection limits of CFP10 
      were 1.2 copies/μl for ddPCR, but 15.8 copies/μl for qPCR. We demonstrated that 
      ddPCR could detect CFP10 and Rv1768 DNA after 3 weeks of infection and at least two 
      weeks earlier than qPCR in M.tb H37Rv-challenged rhesus monkey models. DdPCR could 
      also successfully quantify CFP10 and Rv1768 DNA copy numbers in clinical TB 
      patients' blood samples (active pulmonary TB, extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), and infant 
      TB). To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that ddPCR is an 
      effective and sensitive method of measuring the circulating CFP10 and Rv1768 DNA for 
      vaccine development, bacterial load evaluation in vivo, and early TB (including EPTB 
      and infant TB) diagnosis as well.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) plays a crucial role in resistance to 
      mycobacterial diseases; accordingly, variants of the gene encoding this cytokine may 
      be associated with elevated risk of contracting pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). 
      METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 135 Warao indigenous individuals with 
      newly diagnosed sputum culture-positive TB. Of these, 24 were diagnosed with active 
      tuberculosis (ATB). The study comprised 111 participants, who were grouped as 
      follows: 1) 14 tuberculin skin test (TST)-positive Warao indigenous individuals and 
      4 that were QuantiFERON-TB?Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT) test-positive, collectively 
      comprising the latent TB infection group (LTBI), n = 18), and 2) healthy controls 
      who were QFT-IT- and TST-negative, comprising the control group (CTRL, n = 93). 
      Detection of the IFN γ gene (IFNG) +874A/T polymorphism was performed via PCR and 
      quantification of IFNG expression via qPCR. RESULTS: Relative to indigenous and 
      white Americans, ATB and CTRL groups had a higher frequency of the IFNG SNP (+874A): 
      23 (95.8%) and 108 (97.3%), respectively. Indigenous Warao individuals homozygous 
      for the IFNG (+874) A allele exhibited 3.59-fold increased risk of developing TB 
      (95% confidence interval, 2.60-4.96, p =0.0001). A decreased frequency of the AT 
      genotype was observed in individuals with pulmonary TB (4.16%) and controls (0.90%). 
      The frequency of the TT genotype was decreased among controls (1.80%); none of the 
      patients with TB were found to have this genotype. The differences in IFNG 
      expression between the groups, under unstimulated and stimulated conditions, were 
      not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results demonstrate 
      concordance between IFNG +874 A/A genotype and low expression of IFNG.

TI  - Cerebral microcalcifications in a newborn with congenital tuberculosis.
PG  - 22-8
LID - 10.7705/biomedica.v36i1.2509 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis is a serious public health problem worldwide. In 2012, the World Health 
      Organization estimated 8.6 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths due to the 
      disease. In 2011, the incidence in Colombia was 24 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. 
      There is little information about tuberculosis in pregnant women, and congenital 
      infection is considered a rare disease that is difficult to diagnose, leads to high 
      mortality, and may be confused with tuberculosis acquired after birth. In addition, 
      it has been associated with HIV infection in mothers and infants. Moreover, there is 
      increasing incidence of congenital syphilis in the world. In Colombia, the 
      prevalence is 2.5 cases per 1,000 births and its frequency in the Instituto Materno 
      Infantil-Hospital La Victoria is one case per 57 births. We report the case of a 
      newborn under treatment for congenital syphilis and in whom microcalcifications were 
      found in a transfontanelar ultrasound. This finding warned about the existence of 
      another infectious agent. PCR was negative for cytomegalovirus, and IgM titers for 
      toxoplasma, rubella and herpes I and II were also negative. After learning about a 
      history of incomplete treatment for tuberculosis in the mother, we suspected the 
      presence of an infection by the tubercle bacillus in the newborn. No acid-fast 
      bacilli were demonstrated in three gastric juice samples. The IS6110 PCR assay was 
      found positive in cerebrospinal fluid and urine, but not in blood. The newborn was 
      treated with crystalline penicillin for 10 days along with isoniazid, rifampicin, 
      pyrazinamide and streptomycin. The patient is currently under clinical monitoring.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biomarkers are critical tools for finding new approaches for 
      controlling the spread of tuberculosis (TB), including for predicting the 
      development of TB therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic tools. METHODS: Expression 
      of immune biomarkers was analyzed in peripheral blood cells stimulated and 
      non-stimulated with M. tuberculosis antigens ESAT-6, CFP10 and TB7.7. in Warao 
      indigenous individuals. These biomarkers may be able to differentiate TB states, 
      such as active tuberculosis (ATB) cases and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) 
      from non-infected controls (NIC). A real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-qPCR) assay was performed on 100 blood samples under non-stimulation or 
      direct ex vivo conditions (NS=50) and stimulation conditions (S=50). RESULTS: The 
      findings are shown as the median and interquartile range (IQR) of relative gene 
      expression levels of IFN-γ, CD14, MMP9, CCR5, CCL11, CXCL9/MIG, and uPAR/PLAUR 
      immune biomarkers. MMP9 levels were significantly higher in the LTBI-NS and LTBI-S 
      groups compared with the NIC-NS and NIC-S groups. However, CCR5 levels were 
      significantly lower in the LTBI-S group compared with both NIC-NS and NIC-S groups. 
      CCL11 levels were significantly lower in the LTBI-S group compared with the NIC-NS 
      group. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings showed that MMP9 immune biomarkers 
      separated LTBI indigenous individuals from NIC indigenous individuals, while CCR5, 
      CCL11, CD14, and IFN-γ did not differentiate TB states from NIC. MMP9 may be useful 
      as a potential biomarker for LTBI and new infected case detection among Warao 
      indigenous individuals at high risk of developing the disease. It may also be used 
      to halt the epidemic, which will require further validation in larger studies.

TI  - Soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor as a biomarker of treatment 
      response in childhood tuberculosis.
PG  - 262-266
LID - 10.4103/ijmy.ijmy_52_19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is a major health problem worldwide, 
      especially in developing countries. In 2015, there are estimated 950,000 cases of 
      childhood TB. Since most TB in children is paucibacillary, this gives rise not only 
      to problem in diagnosing but also in monitoring the response to anti-TB treatment as 
      well. Soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a 
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein of various cells of immune 
      system, is one of the potential biomarkers to be used in the management of TB. The 
      objective of this study is to study the decrease of serum suPAR level after anti-TB 
      treatment in children with TB and its association with patient characteristics. 
      METHODS: We conducted a prospective study on children suspected of having TB due to 
      a history of contact with active TB case and symptoms such as coughing, fever, and 
      enlarged lymph nodes. The diagnosis of TB is established by history, physical 
      examination including anthropometric examination. Tuberculin skin test using PPD 
      RT-23 and interferon-gamma releasing assay with Quantiferon TB-Gold Plus was 
      performed. Chest X-rays were read by two independent radiologists. Microbiological 
      examination was performed using microscopic examination and Xpert MTB/RIF. The level 
      of suPAR before and after anti-TB treatment was examined with the Elisa method. 
      RESULTS: There was no significant difference of serum suPAR levels before and after 
      anti-TB treatment (mean 0.71 [standard deviation 0.585] ng/mL; P = 0.072). There was 
      no association between ages (P = 0.112), nutritional status (P = 0.228), diagnosis 
      of pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB (P = 0.956), and radiological feature (P = 0.810) 
      with serum suPAR levels decrease. CONCLUSION: There is no suPAR serum level decrease 
      2 months after treatment with anti-TB and there is no association with age, 
      nutritional status, pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB diagnosis, and radiological 
      feature.

TI  - Effect of two alternative methods of pooling sputum prior to testing for 
      tuberculosis with genexpert MTB/RIF.
PG  - 347
LID - 10.1186/s12879-019-3778-9 [doi]
LID - 347
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pooling sputum specimens is one potential strategy for reducing the cost 
      of using Xpert MTB/RIF, a rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test, for the 
      diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. We sought to compare the sensitivity of two 
      alternative method of pooling. METHODS: Patients referred for assessment for TB, 
      whose initial sputum was Xpert MTB positive, were recruited and their sputum 
      specimens were pooled for analysis with sputum specimens that were Xpert MTB 
      negative. Two alternative pooling strategies were employed: one in which the 
      concentration of sample reagent (buffer) was maintained at 2:1 (standard), in 
      accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and another in which the 
      concentration of sample reagent was reduced to 1:1. RESULTS: We tested 101 Xpert MTB 
      positive sputum specimens. Among these, 96% of valid test results (95% confidence 
      interval (CI) 89-99%) were positive using the "standard buffer method". Using the 
      "reduced buffer pooling" method 94% of valid test results (95% CI 87-98%) were 
      positive. McNemar's test for the difference in paired proportions did not reach 
      statistical significance (P = 0.56). CONCLUSION: We have confirmed that pooling of 
      two sputum specimens for testing in a single cartridge is a valid method of reducing 
      the number of cartridges required when using Xpert MTB to detect pulmonary 
      tuberculosis. Two alternative pooling strategies tested here yielded similar 
      results. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present study was conducted within the Active 
      Casefinding in Tuberculosis (ACT3) Trial. The ACT3 Trial had been registered with 
      Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register on 8th April, 2014. The trial 
      registration number is ACTRN12614000372684 . (Retrospectively registered).

TI  - High prevalence of tuberculosis in newly enrolled HIV patients in Zambia: need for 
      enhanced screening approach.
PG  - 1033-9
LID - 10.5588/ijtld.15.0651 [doi]
AB  - SETTING: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in 
      sub-Saharan Africa. In Zambia, smear microscopy and chest radiography (CXR) are the 
      primary TB diagnostic tools, and most cases are not bacteriologically confirmed. 
      OBJECTIVE: We implemented enhanced screening to determine the TB burden among new 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinic enrollees. DESIGN: Consecutive adult HIV 
      clinic enrollees were screened, regardless of symptoms. All underwent microscopy 
      (Ziehl-Neelsen/fluorescence microscopy) on three sputum specimens, physical 
      examination, and digital CXR. Sputum, blood and urine specimens were cultured. 
      Xpert(®) MTB/RIF testing was performed retrospectively. RESULTS: From July 2011 to 
      April 2012, 399 patients were enrolled. The median age was 34.4 years; body mass 
      index was 20.8 kg/m(2), CD4 count was 202 cells/μl and 86% were symptomatic. 
      Culture-confirmed TB was diagnosed in 72/399 (18%) patients; an additional 31/399 
      (8%) were culture-negative but diagnosed clinically. Symptom screening for any 
      cough, fever, weight loss or night sweats had high sensitivity (95%) but low 
      specificity (14%) for detecting culture-confirmed cases. Among culture-confirmed 
      cases, 35/72 (49%) were missed clinically and detected only by culture. Xpert was 
      64% sensitive and 98% specific. CONCLUSIONS: High TB prevalence was found in 
      Zambians newly enrolled into HIV care. Screening with sensitive diagnostics should 
      be considered with culture when feasible in this population.

AB  - To evaluate the value of miR-29a expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
      (PBMC) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculous 
      meningitis (TBM). Our study enrolled 112 children with TBM and 130 healthy children, 
      from which PBMC and CSF were collected. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of miR-29a in PBMC and CSF, 
      and then analyze the diagnostic value. Compared with control group, the miR-29a 
      expressions in PBMC and CSF were increased in TBM children (both P<0.05), and the 
      expressions were associated with following factors: intracranial hypertension, 
      conscious disturbance, focal cerebral symptoms, meningeal irritation, hydrocrania, 
      abnormal electroencephalogram and extra-cerebral tuberculous (all P<0.05). The 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the sensitivity, 
      specificity and area under the curve (AUC) of miR-29a in PBMC was 67.20%, 88.50% and 
      0.852, respectively, and that in CSF was 81.10%, 90.00% and 0.890, respectively, and 
      that in combination of PBMC and CSF was 84.40%, 95.38% and 0.934, respectively. 
      miR-29a expression in PBMC and CSF may provide a reference for the diagnosis of 
      pediatric TBM.

TI  - Diagnostic value of blood gene expression signatures in active tuberculosis in 
      Thais: a pilot study.
PG  - 253-60

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem. Routine laboratory tests or 
      newly developed molecular detection are limited to the quality of sputum sample. 
      Here we selected genes specific to TB by a minimum redundancy-maximum relevancy 
      package using publicly available microarray data and determine level of selected 
      genes in blood collected from a Thai TB cohort of 40 active TB patients, 38 healthy 
      controls and 18 previous TB patients using quantitative real-time PCR. FCGR1A, 
      FCGR1B variant 1, FCGR1B variant 2, APOL1, GBP5, PSTPIP2, STAT1, KCNJ15, MAFB and 
      KAZN had significantly higher expression level in active TB individuals as compared 
      with healthy controls and previous TB cases (P<0.01). A mathematical method was 
      applied to calculate TB predictive score, which contains the level of expression of 
      seven genes and this score can identify active TB cases with 82.5% sensitivity and 
      100% specificity as compared with conventional culture confirmation. In addition, TB 
      predictive scores in active TB patients were reduced to normal after completion of 
      standard short-course therapy, which was mostly in concordant with the disease 
      outcome. These finding suggested that blood gene expression measurement and TB Sick 
      Score could have potential value in terms of diagnosis of TB and anti-TB treatment 
      monitoring.

TI  - Sensitivity and specificity of WHO's recommended four-symptom screening rule for 
      tuberculosis in people living with HIV: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2011, WHO recommends a four-symptom screening rule to exclude 
      active tuberculosis in people living with HIV before starting tuberculosis 
      preventive treatment (ie, absence of current cough, weight loss, night sweats, or 
      fever). We assessed the sensitivity and specificity of the screening rule among 
      people living with HIV based on antiretroviral therapy (ART) status and the added 
      contribution of chest radiography. METHODS: We did a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from Jan 1, 
      2011, to March 12, 2018, for studies published after the WHO issued recommendations 
      on the use of the four-symptom screening rule. We also searched abstracts from 
      relevant international conferences. We included studies that collected sputum or any 
      specimens (eg, urine, blood, or fine-needle aspirates from lymph nodes) from people 
      with HIV regardless of signs or symptoms. Case-control studies were excluded because 
      they are prone to bias. Active tuberculosis was diagnosed with bacteriological 
      confirmation by culture or Xpert MTB/RIF of any specimens. Two investigators 
      extracted the data, including age, sex, and ART status. We calculated sensitivity, 
      specificity, and 95% CI. When at least four studies were available, we estimated 
      pooled sensitivity and specificity using random and effects bivariate models; 
      otherwise we used univariate random-effects models. FINDINGS: Of 4615 records 
      identified by the search, 21 were included in the review (involving 15 427 people 
      including 1559 with active tuberculosis). 18 eligible studies were included in the 
      final meta-analysis. Seven studies provided data on people receiving ART. The pooled 
      sensitivity of the four-symptom screening rule was lower for 4640 people on ART 
      (51·0%, 95% CI 28·4-73·2) than for 8664 who were ART-naive (89·4%, 83·0-93·5). 
      Pooled specificity for those on ART was 70·7% (95% CI 47·8-86·4) and for ART-naive 
      people was 28·1% (18·6-40·1). On the basis of data from 646 individuals in two 
      studies, the addition of any abnormal chest radiographic findings in people on ART 
      improved sensitivity from 52·2% (95% CI 38·0-66·0) to 84·6% (69·7-92·9) but 
      decreased specificity from 55·5% (95% CI 51·8-59·2) to 29·8% (26·3-33·6). 
      INTERPRETATION: Our review suggested a lower sensitivity of the WHO four-symptom 
      screening rule among people with HIV who are on ART than in those who are ART naive. 
      The addition of chest radiography could improve the screening rule in people living 
      with HIV who are on ART, provided it does not pose a barrier to preventive 
      treatment. FUNDING: None.

AB  - Recent developments in the field of TB diagnostics, including the introduction of 
      the Xpert MTB/RIF assay in field testing, raise the hope for faster and more 
      accurate identification of active TB patients. However, there are still many issues 
      that need to be addressed as no point-of-care tests are yet available. Furthermore, 
      no tests are available which are universally applicable to all patients. 
      Improvements in the microbiological and molecular-based approaches are promising and 
      the diagnostic pipeline is encouraging. Host markers associated with active disease 
      may hold promise, especially in situations where sputum diagnostics are problematic, 
      including in children, HIV-infected individuals and in the case of extrapulmonary 
      TB.

AB  - BACKGROUND. Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is administered at birth to 
      protect infants against tuberculosis throughout Africa, where most perinatal HIV-1 
      transmission occurs. We examined whether BCG vaccination alters the levels of 
      activated HIV target T cells in HIV-exposed South African infants. METHODS. 
      HIV-exposed infants were randomized to receive routine (at birth) or delayed (at 8 
      weeks) BCG vaccination. Activated and CCR5-expressing peripheral blood CD4(+) T 
      cell, monocyte, and NK cell frequencies were evaluated by flow cytometry and immune 
      gene expression via PCR using Biomark (Fluidigm). RESULTS. Of 149 infants 
      randomized, 92% (n = 137) were retained at 6 weeks: 71 in the routine BCG arm and 66 
      in the delayed arm. Routine BCG vaccination led to a 3-fold increase in systemic 
      activation of HIV target CD4(+)CCR5(+) T cells (HLA-DR(+)CD38(+)) at 6 weeks (0.25% 
      at birth versus 0.08% in delayed vaccination groups; P = 0.029), which persisted 
      until 8 weeks of age when the delayed arm was vaccinated. Vaccination of the infants 
      in the delayed arm at 8 weeks resulted in a similar increase in activated 
      CD4(+)CCR5(+) T cells. The increase in activated T cells was associated with 
      increased levels of MHC class II transactivator (CIITA), IL12RB1, and IFN-α1 
      transcripts within peripheral blood mononuclear cells but minimal changes in innate 
      cells. CONCLUSION. BCG vaccination induces immune changes in HIV-exposed infants, 
      including an increase in the proportion of activated CCR5(+)CD4(+) HIV target cells. 
      These findings provide insight into optimal BCG vaccine timing to minimize the risks 
      of HIV transmissions to exposed infants while preserving potential benefits 
      conferred by BCG vaccination. TRIAL REGISTRATION. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02062580.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the severest form of tuberculosis, but 
      current diagnostic tests are insensitive. Recent reports suggest simple 
      modifications to conventional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining 
      may greatly improve sensitivity. We sought to define the performance of modified and 
      conventional ZN stain for TBM diagnosis. METHODS: In hospitals in Vietnam, South 
      Africa and Indonesia we conducted a prospective study of modified ZN with or without 
      cytospin, conventional ZN smear, GeneXpert, and culture on CSF in adults with 
      suspected TBM. RESULTS: A total of 618 individuals were enrolled across 3 sites. 
      Compared with the TBM clinical diagnostic gold standard for research (definite 
      probable or possible TBM), sensitivity of conventional ZN and modified ZN with 
      cytospin were 33.9% and 34.5% respectively (p = 1.0 for the difference between 
      tests), compared with culture 31.8% and Xpert 25.1%. Using culture as a reference, 
      sensitivities of conventional ZN, modified ZN with cytospin, and Xpert were 66.4%, 
      67.5%, and 72.3%, respectively. Higher CSF volume and lactate, and lower CSF:blood 
      glucose ratio were independently associated with microbiologically confirmed TBM. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Modified ZN stain does not improve diagnosis of TBM. Currently 
      available tests are insensitive, but testing large CSF volumes improves performance. 
      New diagnostic tests for TBM are urgently required.

AB  - HIV-associated disseminated TB (tuberculosis) has been under-recognised and poorly 
      characterised. Blood culture is the gold-standard diagnostic test, but is expensive, 
      slow, and may under-diagnose TB dissemination. In a cohort of hospitalised HIV 
      patients, we aimed to report the prevalence of TB-blood-culture positivity, 
      performance of rapid diagnostics as diagnostic surrogates, and better characterise 
      the clinical phenotype of disseminated TB. HIV-inpatients were systematically 
      investigated using sputum, urine and blood testing. Overall, 132/410 (32.2%) 
      patients had confirmed TB; 41/132 (31.1%) had a positive TB blood culture, of these 
      9/41 (22.0%) died within 90-days. In contrast to sputum diagnostics, urine Xpert and 
      urine-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) combined identified 88% of TB blood-culture-positive 
      patients, including 9/9 who died within 90-days. For confirmed-TB patients, half the 
      variation in major clinical variables was captured on two principle components 
      (PCs). Urine Xpert, urine LAM and TB-blood-culture positive patients clustered 
      similarly on these axes, distinctly from patients with localised disease. Total 
      number of positive tests from urine Xpert, urine LAM and MTB-blood-culture 
      correlated with PCs (p < 0.001 for both). PC1&PC2 independently predicted 90-day 
      mortality (ORs 2.6, 95%CI = 1.3-6.4; and 2.4, 95%CI = 1.3-4.5, respectively). Rather 
      than being a non-specific diagnosis, disseminated TB is a distinct, life-threatening 
      condition, which can be diagnosed using rapid urine-based tests, and warrants 
      specific interventional trials.

TI  - The sensitivity of the QuantiFERON(®)-TB Gold Plus assay in Zambian adults with 
      active tuberculosis.
PG  - 690-696
LID - 10.5588/ijtld.16.0764 [doi]
AB  - SETTING AND OBJECTIVE: To investigate the sensitivity of the new interferon-gamma 
      release assay (IGRA), QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), for active TB (used as a 
      surrogate for latent tuberculous infection) in a Zambian TB clinic. DESIGN: 
      Consecutive smear or Xpert® MTB/RIF-positive adult (age 18 years) pulmonary TB 
      patients were recruited between June 2015 and March 2016. Venous blood was tested 
      using QFT-Plus. The sensitivity was defined as the number positive divided by the 
      total number tested. Using logistic regression, factors associated with positive 
      QFT-Plus results were explored. RESULTS: Of 108 patients (median age 32 years, 
      interquartile range 27-38; 73% male; 63% human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] 
      positive), 90 were QFT-Plus-positive, 11 were negative and seven had indeterminate 
      results; sensitivity was 83% (95%CI 75-90). There was no difference in sensitivity 
      by HIV status (HIV-positive 85%, 95%CI 75-93; n = 68 vs. HIV-negative 80%, 95%CI 
      64-91; n = 40; P = 0.59). In models adjusted for age alone, CD4 cell count <100 
      cells/μl (OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.02-0.96; P = 0.05) and body mass index <18.5 kg/m2 (OR 
      0.27, 95%CI 0.08-0.91; P = 0.02) were associated with decreased odds of positive 
      QFT-Plus results. CONCLUSION: Overall, the sensitivity of QFT-Plus is similar to 
      that of the tuberculin skin test and other IGRAs. While overall sensitivity is not 
      affected by HIV status, QFT-Plus sensitivity was lower among people living with 
      HIV/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome with severe immunosuppression.

PG  - e0180572
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0180572 [doi]
LID - e0180572
AB  - BACKGROUND: Introduction of GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay has constituted a major 
      breakthrough for tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics. Several patient factors may 
      influence diagnostic performance of Xpert including sputum quality. OBJECTIVE: We 
      carried out a prospective, observational, cross-sectional study to determine the 
      effect of sputum quality on diagnostic performance of Xpert among presumed TB 
      patients in Uganda. METHODS: We collected clinical and demographic information and 
      two sputum samples from participants. Staff recorded sputum quality and performed 
      LED fluorescence microscopy and mycobacterial culture on each sample. If both smear 
      examinations were negative, Xpert testing was performed. We calculated diagnostic 
      yield, sensitivity, specificity, and other indicators for Xpert for each stratum of 
      sputum quality in reference to a standard of mycobacterial culture. RESULTS: 
      Patients with salivary sputum showed a trend towards a substantially higher 
      proportion of samples that were Xpert-positive (54/286, 19%, 95% CI 15-24) compared 
      with those with all other sputum sample types (221/1496, 15%, 95% CI 13-17). 
      Blood-stained sputum produced the lowest sensitivity (28%; 95% CI 12-49) and 
      salivary sputum the highest (66%; 95% CI 53-77). Specificity didn't vary 
      meaningfully by sample types. Salivary sputum was significantly more sensitive than 
      mucoid sputum (+13%, 95% CI +1 to +26), while blood-stained sputum was significantly 
      less sensitive (-24%, 95% CI -42 to -5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the 
      need to exercise caution in collecting sputum for Xpert and in interpreting results 
      because sputum quality may impact test yield and sensitivity. In particular, it may 
      be wise to pursue additional testing should blood-stained sputum test negative while 
      salivary sputum should be readily accepted for Xpert testing given its higher 
      sensitivity and potentially higher yield than other sample types. These findings 
      challenge conventional recommendations against collecting salivary sputum for TB 
      diagnosis and could inform new standards for sputum quality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite increasing reports of the linkage between diabetes and 
      tuberculosis (TB), there is limited information regarding diabetes and TB drug 
      resistance. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, sputum and blood samples were 
      collected from 304 adult patients in rural Andhra Pradesh. Rifampin resistance was 
      assessed by Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), and diabetes status was based on self-report. 
      Additionally, samples were assayed by acid-fast bacilli sputum smear microscopy 
      (AFB) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-G), in order to compare relative 
      diagnostic performances. RESULTS: Among patients with confirmed TB (n = 194), 
      diabetes was associated with 3.0-fold higher risk of rifampin resistance (95 % CI 
      1.3-6.7). Considering Xpert MTB/RIF the gold standard, AFB had lower sensitivity 
      (72.2 vs. 82.5 %) and higher specificity (96.4 vs. 37.0 %) compared to QFT-G for 
      diagnosing TB. CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of rifampin resistance in patients 
      with diabetes highlights the need for integrated diabetes surveillance in TB 
      programs, particularly in settings undergoing the epidemiological transition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood stream tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      (MTB) is common among HIV-positive patients, turning rapidly fatal unless detected 
      and treated promptly. Blood culture is currently the standard test for the detection 
      of MTB in whole blood but results take weeks; patients deteriorate markedly and 
      often die before a diagnosis of blood stream TB is made. Rapid molecular tests on 
      whole blood, with potential for same day diagnosis of blood stream TB usually show 
      low sensitivity due to the problem of insufficient MTB DNA template when extraction 
      is performed directly on low blood volumes. This study assessed the influence of 
      blood volume on the sensitivity of a HyBeacon PCR assay-the FluoroType MTB (Hain 
      Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) on direct detection of MTB in whole blood. METHODS: 
      Prospective recruitment of HIV-positive patients with clinical suspicion of blood 
      stream TB but not on anti-TB or HIV drug treatment was done. Venous blood samples 
      were collected and DNA extracted using the MolYsis (Molzym, Bremen, Germany) 
      methods; for study A, from duplicate 1 ml (42 patients) and for study B (31 
      patients) from 9 ml EDTA blood samples. The FluoroType MTB PCR assay targeting an 
      IS6110 sequence was performed and results compared with blood culture. RESULTS: The 
      diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the FluoroType MTB PCR in study A was 33% 
      and 97%, respectively. Corresponding values in study B were 71% and 96%, 
      respectively. In both studies, one case each of blood culture-negative blood stream 
      TB was detected with the FluoroType MTB PCR assay. The median time to positivity of 
      blood culture was 20.1 (range 12-32) for study A and 19.9 days (range 15-30) for 
      study B. CONCLUSION: Larger blood volumes (9 ml) improved and gave acceptable 
      sensitivity of direct PCR diagnosis of blood stream TB.

TI  - Facing the crisis: improving the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the HIV era.
PG  - S15-27
AB  - Although the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection pandemic has had a 
      catastrophic impact on tuberculosis (TB) control efforts, especially in sub-Saharan 
      Africa, most of the fundamental concepts reflected in the directly observed 
      treatment, short course (DOTS) strategy still hold true in the HIV era. What has 
      changed, and dramatically, is the importance of speedy and accurate TB diagnosis and 
      the difficulty of achieving this. The disproportionate amount of smear-negative 
      disease in sub-Saharan Africa, which shoulders two-thirds of the global burden of 
      HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, has greatly complicated TB 
      case detection and disease control. Now, 15 years after TB rates began to soar in 
      countries where HIV infection is prevalent, we have learned that the conventional 
      approach -- passively waiting for patients with advanced symptomatic disease to make 
      their way to microscopy centers for diagnosis -- has disastrous consequences. 
      Without better diagnostic tools for TB and effective strategies for their 
      implementation, transmission will not be interrupted, mortality will not be checked, 
      and TB will not be controlled in areas where HIV infection is prevalent. 
      Fortunately, a number of technical opportunities exist for the creation of improved 
      diagnostic tests. Developing and exploiting such tests to support TB control in 
      HIV-infected populations is an urgent priority. A substantial public sector effort 
      is under way to work in partnership with the biotechnology industry to accelerate 
      progress toward that goal. In this article, we will define the need for better TB 
      tests and describe technologies being developed to meet that need.

TI  - Hyperglycaemia is inversely correlated with live M. bovis BCG-specific CD4(+) T cell 
      responses in Tanzanian adults with latent or active tuberculosis.
PG  - 345-353
LID - 10.1002/iid3.222 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The rising prevalence of Diabetes mellitus (DM) in high TB-endemic 
      countries may adversely affect sustainability of TB control since DM constitutes a 
      risk factor for development of active tuberculosis (TB). The impact of DM on TB 
      specific adaptive immune responses remains poorly addressed, particularly in people 
      living in Sub-Saharan countries. We performed a functional characterization of TB 
      specific cellular immune response in Tanzanian subjects with active or latent 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection stratified by their diabetic status. 
      METHODS: HIV negative active TB patients (≥18 years) with Xpert MTB/RIF positive 
      pulmonary TB were included before starting TB treatment in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania 
      between April and December 2013. HIV negative healthy controls latently infected 
      with TB but without past TB history were also included. Active and latent TB 
      patients were stratified in two groups according to their diabetic status. 
      Peripheral Blood Mononuclear cells were stimulated with either live M. bovis BCG or 
      Mtb-specific peptide pools and analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining and 
      polychromatic flow cytometry. RESULTS: Our results show a lower frequency of IFN-γ 
      CD4(+) T cells in patients with active TB and DM compared to patients with active TB 
      only after live M. bovis BCG (p = 0.04) but not after Mtb peptide pools 
      re-stimulation. Irrespective of TB status, level of glycaemia is selectively 
      inversely correlated with IFN-γ and TNF-α CD4(+) T cell production (p = 0.02 and 
      p = 0.03) after live M. bovis BCG stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: These results support 
      the hypothesis that hyperglycaemia negatively impacts antigen processing and/or 
      presentation of whole mycobacteria delaying secretion of key cytokines involved in 
      TB immunity.

TI  - Systematic or Test-Guided Treatment for Tuberculosis in HIV-Infected Adults.
PG  - 2397-2410
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1910708 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In regions with high burdens of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency 
      virus (HIV), many HIV-infected adults begin antiretroviral therapy (ART) when they 
      are already severely immunocompromised. Mortality after ART initiation is high in 
      these patients, and tuberculosis and invasive bacterial diseases are common causes 
      of death. METHODS: We conducted a 48-week trial of empirical treatment for 
      tuberculosis as compared with treatment guided by testing in HIV-infected adults who 
      had not previously received ART and had CD4+ T-cell counts below 100 cells per cubic 
      millimeter. Patients recruited in Ivory Coast, Uganda, Cambodia, and Vietnam were 
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo screening (Xpert MTB/RIF test, urinary 
      lipoarabinomannan test, and chest radiography) to determine whether treatment for 
      tuberculosis should be started or to receive systematic empirical treatment with 
      rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide daily for 2 months, followed by 
      rifampin and isoniazid daily for 4 months. The primary end point was a composite of 
      death from any cause or invasive bacterial disease within 24 weeks (primary 
      analysis) or within 48 weeks after randomization. RESULTS: A total of 522 patients 
      in the systematic-treatment group and 525 in the guided-treatment group were 
      included in the analyses. At week 24, the rate of death from any cause or invasive 
      bacterial disease (calculated as the number of first events per 100 patient-years) 
      was 19.4 with systematic treatment and 20.3 with guided treatment (adjusted hazard 
      ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 1.44). At week 48, the 
      corresponding rates were 12.8 and 13.3 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.67 to 
      1.40]). At week 24, the probability of tuberculosis was lower with systematic 
      treatment than with guided treatment (3.0% vs. 17.9%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.15; 
      95% CI, 0.09 to 0.26), but the probability of grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse 
      events was higher with systematic treatment (17.4% vs. 7.2%; adjusted hazard ratio 
      2.57; 95% CI, 1.75 to 3.78). Serious adverse events were more common with systematic 
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Among severely immunosuppressed adults with HIV infection 
      who had not previously received ART, systematic treatment for tuberculosis was not 
      superior to test-guided treatment in reducing the rate of death or invasive 
      bacterial disease over 24 or 48 weeks and was associated with more grade 3 or 4 
      adverse events. (Funded by the Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le Sida et les

TI  - Transcriptional Profiling of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells Identifies 
      Diagnostic Biomarkers That Distinguish Active and Latent Tuberculosis.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection in humans can cause active 
      disease or latent infection. However, the factors contributing to the maintenance of 
      latent infection vs. disease progression are poorly understood. In this study, we 
      used a genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach to identify host factors 
      associated with M. tuberculosis infection status and a novel gene signature that can 
      distinguish active disease from latent infection. By RNA-seq, we characterized 
      transcriptional differences in purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) among three groups: patients with active 
      tuberculosis (ATB), individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI), and TB-uninfected 
      controls (CON). A total of 401 differentially expressed genes enabled grouping of 
      individuals into three clusters. A validation study by quantitative real-time PCR 
      (qRT-PCR) confirmed the differential expression of TNFRSF10C, IFNG, PGM5, EBF3, and 
      A2ML1 between the ATB and LTBI groups. Additional clinical validation was performed 
      to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these five biomarkers using 130 subjects. 
      The 3-gene signature set of TNFRSF10C, EBF3, and A2ML1 enabled correct 
      classification of 91.5% of individuals, with a high sensitivity of 86.2% and 
      specificity of 94.9%. Diagnostic performance of the 3-gene signature set was 
      validated using a clinical cohort of 147 subjects with suspected ATB. The 
      sensitivity and specificity of the 3-gene set for ATB were 82.4 and 92.4%, 
      respectively. In conclusion, we detected distinct gene expression patterns in PBMCs 
      stimulated by PPD depending on the status of M. tuberculosis infection. Furthermore, 
      we identified a 3-gene signature set that could distinguish ATB from LTBI, which may 
      facilitate rapid diagnosis and treatment for more effective disease control.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most prevalent pulmonary diseases caused by 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). MiRNAs (miRNAs) participate in TB progression by 
      modulating the host-pathogen interaction. Bioinformatics advancements provide basis 
      for exploring novel immunoregulatory miRNAs and their performance as diagnostic 
      biomarkers. Gene and miRNA expression datasets, GSE29190 and GSE54992, were 
      downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Based on fold changes and 
      statistical significance, a total of 7463 differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNAs) 
      and 38 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were screened. Function 
      annotation and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were constructed to reveal 
      underlying mechanisms of TB pathogenesis. Functional annotation identified the MAPK 
      signalling pathway and leukocyte migration as the top enriched processes. The PPI 
      and MGIP networks indicated that chemokine ligands like CXCL1/CXCL2 and receptors, 
      like CCR7 were important down-regulated genes, implying that a protective mechanism 
      against overdue inflammation induced cell death. MiRNA-gene-immune processes (MGIP) 
      network enriched 7 deregulated miRNAs, and their expression was further examined 
      with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), in PBMC samples of 20 active TB patients 
      and 20 healthy donors. The diagnostic performance was evaluated with ROC curves. 
      MiR-892b; miR-199b-5p and miR-582-5p were significantly deregulated in TB patients, 
      compared with healthy participants. The best overall performance was from miR-892b, 
      with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.77, 55% sensitivity and 90% specificity. AUC of 
      miR-199b-5p and miR-582-5p were 0.71 and 0.70, respectively. MiR-892b, miR-199b-5p 
      and miR-582-5p could be considered promising novel diagnostic biomarkers for active 
      tuberculosis.

TI  - Comparative performance of urinary lipoarabinomannan assays and Xpert MTB/RIF in 
      HIV-infected individuals.
PG  - 1307-14

AB  - BACKGROUND: Xpert MTB/RIF ('Xpert') and urinary lipoarabinomannan (LAM) assays offer 
      rapid tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis, but have suboptimal sensitivity when used 
      individually in HIV-positive patients. The yield of these tests used in combination 
      for the diagnosis of active TB among HIV-infected TB suspects is unknown. DESIGN: 
      Study of comparative diagnostic accuracy nested into a prospective study of 
      HIV-infected individuals with signs and/or symptoms of TB in Uganda. METHODS: Xpert 
      testing of archived sputum was conducted for culture-confirmed TB cases and TB 
      suspects in whom a diagnosis of TB was excluded. Additional testing included sputum 
      smear microscopy, sputum culture (solid and liquid media), mycobacterial blood 
      culture, and urinary testing for LAM using a lateral flow test ('LF-LAM') and an 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbance assay ('ELISA-LAM'). RESULTS: Among 103 participants 
      with culture-confirmed TB, sensitivity of Xpert was 76% (95% confidence interval, CI 
      0.66-0.84), and was superior to that of LF-LAM (49%, 95% CI 0.39-0.59, P < 0.001). 
      Specificity was greater than 97% for both tests among 105 individuals without TB. 
      The combination of smear microscopy and LF-LAM identified 67% (95% CI 0.57-0.76) of 
      culture-confirmed TB cases and approached sensitivity of Xpert testing alone (P = 
      0.15). The sensitivity of the combination of Xpert and LF-LAM was 85% (88/103 95% CI 
      0.77-0.92), which was superior to either test alone (P < 0.05) and approached 
      sensitivity of sputum liquid culture testing (94%, 95% CI 0.88-0.98, P = 0.17). 
      CONCLUSION: Sputum Xpert and urinary LAM assays were complementary for the diagnosis 
      of active TB in HIV-infected patients, and sensitivity of the combination of these 
      tests was superior to that of either test alone.

AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential clinical value of the 
      plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) concentrations and strand integrity as an auxiliary 
      tool for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) differential diagnosis from tuberculosis 
      in patients with solitary pulmonary nodules detected by computed tomography (CT). 
      METHODS: This research was divided into 3 groups: NSCLC (n=106), tuberculosis 
      (n=105) and healthy controls (n=107). The quantization of plasma DNA fragments was 
      performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Amplifying and quantifying shorter (115bp) 
      and longer (247bp) fragments from abundant genomic ALU repeats. RESULTS: The level 
      of cfDNA (ALU115) in patients with NSCLC [95.67 (51.28, 238.85) ng/μl] was 
      significantly higher than that in patients with tuberculosis [59.60 (34.25, 102.53) 
      ng/μl, P=0.001] and that in healthy controls [44.66 (24.56, 66.54) ng/μl, P=0.001]. 
      The integrity of cfDNA in patients with NSCLC [5.91(4.14, 7.45)] was also 
      significantly higher than that in patients with tuberculosis [3.85 (2.91, 5.06), 
      P=0.000] and that in healthy controls [2.78(2.18, 4.82), P=0.000]. 
      Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that cfDNA(ALU115) and 
      its integrity could be used as biomarkers to distinguish NSCLC from tuberculosis 
      (AUC=0.628, P=0.001, cut-off values=91.48, sensitivity=57.50%, specificity=64.80%; 
      AUC=0.722, P=0.000, cut-off values=5.54, sensitivity=55.70%, specificity=82.90%, 
      respectively). In addition, the effect of integrity of cfDNA(AUC=0.722) to 
      distinguish NSCLC from tuberculosis was higher than traditional tumor marker 
      Carbohydrate antigen 125(CA125) (AUC=0.626), Neuron-specific enolase(NSE) 
      (AUC=0.716) and Carcino-embryonic antigen(CEA) (AUC=0.589). CONCLUSIONS: cfDNA and 
      its integrity could be used as indicators for identification of NSCLC from 
      tuberculosis. Moreover, the effect of integrity of cfDNA to distinguish NSCLC from 
      tuberculosis was higher than traditional tumor marker CA125, NSE and CEA.

AB  - In this study, we developed a mouse model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using 
      streptozotocin and nicotinamide and identified factors that increase susceptibility 
      of T2DM mice to infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). All Mtb-infected T2DM 
      mice and 40% of uninfected T2DM mice died within 10 months, whereas all control mice 
      survived. In Mtb-infected mice, T2DM increased the bacterial burden and pro- and 
      anti-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in the lungs relative to those 
      in uninfected T2DM mice and infected control mice. Levels of IL-6 also increased. 
      Anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody treatment of Mtb-infected acute- and chronic-T2DM mice 
      increased survival (to 100%) and reduced pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine 
      expression. CD11c+ cells were the major source of IL-6 in Mtb-infected T2DM mice. 
      Pulmonary natural killer (NK) cells in Mtb-infected T2DM mice further increased IL-6 
      production by autologous CD11c+ cells through their activating receptors. Anti-NK1.1 
      antibody treatment of Mtb-infected acute-T2DM mice increased survival and reduced 
      pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. Furthermore, IL-6 increased 
      inflammatory cytokine production by T lymphocytes in pulmonary tuberculosis patients 
      with T2DM. Overall, the results suggest that NK-CD11c+ cell interactions increase 
      IL-6 production, which in turn drives the pathological immune response and mortality 
      associated with Mtb infection in diabetic mice.

AB  - Hemophagocytic syndrome is a life-threatening disease characterized by the 
      uncontrolled activation of macrophages, resulting in hemophagocytosis of blood cells 
      in the bone marrow. A 20-year-old gravida at 23-week and 5-day gestation was 
      admitted to hospital to evaluate fever up to 104°F of unknown origin, moderate 
      cytopenia, and elevated levels of liver enzymes. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed 
      hemophagocytic syndrome, and polymerase chain reaction came back positive for 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Supportive care and tuberculosis treatment resulted in 
      clinical improvement. At 27 weeks and 5 days, premature rupture of the membranes 
      occurred, and because of the high probability of reactivating the hemophagocytic 
      syndrome, a cesarean section was performed at 29-week and 2-day gestation. 
      Hemophagocytic syndrome is an uncommon disease which rarely appears during 
      pregnancy. Early diagnosis and treatment can save both maternal and fetal lives.

TI  - Molecular techniques in mycobacterial detection.
PG  - 122-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical utility of the commercial nucleic acid 
      amplification (NAA) tests (ie, Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test, 
      Gen-Probe, Inc and AMPLICOR Mycobacterium tuberculosis Test, Roche Molecular 
      Systems, Inc) for direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. DATA 
      SOURCES: Review of the English-language literature. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of 
      both NAA tests is excellent (sensitivity, > or = 95%; specificity, 100%) when 
      testing respiratory specimens that are smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). 
      Only the Gen-Probe assay is approved for testing respiratory specimens regardless of 
      the AFB smear result. Data from 3 studies showed that the sensitivity of the 
      Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test in smear-negative patients ranged from 83% to 
      85%, and that the specificity was 99%. Both NAA tests have been used to test 
      nonrespiratory specimens; in some studies, the performance was comparable to the 
      performance obtained for respiratory specimens, whereas in others, it was lower. The 
      NAA tests also appear to be reliable tools for rapid detection of M tuberculosis 
      complex in positive broth cultures of all specimen types (except blood). The impact 
      of the NAA tests on patient outcome varies based on the result of the AFB smear. In 
      smear-positive patients, public health and hospital infection-control resources are 
      predominantly affected. The potential for influencing patient outcome is much 
      greater when the AFB smear is negative. In smear-negative patients, the NAA test 
      could provide more rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and subsequent initiation of 
      therapy; eliminate the need for invasive diagnostic procedures, which are both 
      costly and pose an added risk to the patient; and allow earlier discharge of 
      hospitalized patients. Prospective studies concerning the cost-effectiveness of the 
      NAA tests are needed.

TI  - The clinical utility of the urine-based lateral flow lipoarabinomannan assay in 
      HIV-infected adults in Myanmar: an observational study.
PG  - 145
LID - 10.1186/s12916-017-0888-3 [doi]
LID - 145
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of the point-of-care lateral flow lipoarabinomannan (LF-LAM) 
      test may expedite tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in HIV-positive patients. However, the 
      test's clinical utility is poorly defined outside sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: The 
      study enrolled consecutive HIV-positive adults at a tertiary referral hospital in 
      Yangon, Myanmar. On enrolment, patients had a LF-LAM test performed according to the 
      manufacturer's instructions. Clinicians managing the patients were unaware of the 
      LF-LAM result, which was correlated with the patient's clinical course over the 
      ensuing 6 months. RESULTS: The study enrolled 54 inpatients and 463 outpatients 
      between July 1 and December 31, 2015. On enrolment, the patients' median 
      (interquartile range) CD4 T-cell count was 270 (128-443) cells/mm(3). The baseline 
      LF-LAM test was positive in 201/517 (39%). TB was confirmed microbiologically during 
      follow-up in 54/517 (10%), with rifampicin resistance present in 8/54 (15%). In the 
      study's resource-limited setting, extrapulmonary testing for TB was not possible, 
      but after 6 months, 97/201 (48%) with a positive LF-LAM test on enrolment had 
      neither died, required hospitalisation, received a TB diagnosis or received 
      empirical anti-TB therapy, suggesting a high rate of false-positive results. Of the 
      97 false-positive tests, 89 (92%) were grade 1 positive, suggesting poor test 
      specificity using this cut-off. Only 21/517 (4%) patients were inpatients with TB 
      symptoms and a CD4 T-cell count of < 100 cells/mm(3). Five (24%) of these 21 died, 
      three of whom had a positive LF-LAM test on enrolment. However, all three received 
      anti-TB therapy before death - two after diagnosis with Xpert MTB/RIF testing, while 
      the other received empirical treatment. It is unlikely that knowledge of the 
      baseline LF-LAM result would have averted any of the study's other 11 deaths; eight 
      had a negative test, and of the three patients with a positive test, two received 
      anti-TB therapy before death, while one died from laboratory-confirmed cryptococcal 
      meningitis. The test was no better than a simple, clinical history excluding TB 
      during follow-up (negative predictive value (95% confidence interval): 94% (91-97) 
      vs. 94% (91-96)). CONCLUSIONS: The LF-LAM test had limited clinical utility in the 
      management of HIV-positive patients in this Asian referral hospital setting.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy, incremental yield and prognostic value of Determine TB-LAM for 
      routine diagnostic testing for tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients requiring acute 
      hospital admission in South Africa: a prospective cohort.
PG  - 67

LID - 67
AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported that one-third of HIV-positive adults requiring 
      medical admission to a South African district hospital had laboratory-confirmed 
      tuberculosis (TB) and that almost two-thirds of cases could be rapidly diagnosed 
      using Xpert MTB/RIF-testing of concentrated urine samples obtained on the first day 
      of admission. Implementation of urine-based, routine, point-of-care TB screening is 
      an attractive intervention that might be facilitated by use of a simple, low-cost 
      diagnostic tool, such as the Determine TB-LAM lateral-flow rapid test for 
      HIV-associated TB. METHODS: Sputum, urine and blood samples were systematically 
      obtained from unselected HIV-positive adults within 24 hours of admission to a South 
      African township hospital. Additional clinical samples were obtained during 
      hospitalization as clinically indicated. TB was defined by the detection of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis in any sample using Xpert MTB/RIF or liquid culture. The 
      diagnostic yield, accuracy and prognostic value of urine-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) 
      testing were determined, but urine-LAM results did not inform treatment decisions. 
      RESULTS: Consecutive HIV-positive adult acute medical admissions not already 
      receiving TB treatment (n = 427) were enrolled regardless of clinical presentation 
      or symptoms. TB was diagnosed in 139 patients (TB prevalence 32.6%; median CD4 count 
      80 cells/μL). In the first 24 hours of admission, sputum (spot and/or induced) 
      samples were obtained from 37.0% of patients and urine samples from 99.5% of 
      patients (P < 0.001). The diagnostic yields from these specimens were 19.4% 
      (n = 27/139) for sputum-microscopy, 26.6% (n = 37/139) for sputum-Xpert, 38.1% 
      (n = 53/139) for urine-LAM and 52.5% (n = 73/139) for sputum-Xpert/urine-LAM 
      combined (P < 0.01). Corresponding yields among patients with CD4 counts <100 
      cells/μL were 18.9%, 24.3%, 55.4% and 63.5%, respectively (P < 0.01). The diagnostic 
      yield of urine-LAM was unrelated to respiratory symptoms, and LAM assay specificity 
      (using a grade-2 cut-off) was 98.9% (274/277; 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      96.9-99.8). Among TB cases, positive urine-LAM status was strongly associated with 
      mortality at 90 days (adjusted hazard ratio 4.20; 95% CI 1.50-11.75). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Routine testing for TB in newly admitted HIV-positive adults using Determine TB-LAM 
      to test urine provides major incremental diagnostic yield with very high specificity 
      when used in combination with sputum testing and has important utility among those 
      without respiratory TB symptoms and/or unable to produce sputum. The assay also 
      rapidly identifies individuals with a poor prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a major risk factor for the development of tuberculosis 
      (TB). In India, Melghat is among the tribal regions which consist of highest number 
      of malnutrition cases. Because of the paucity of TB data from these malnourished 
      areas there is an urgent need for the development and evaluation of improved TB 
      diagnostic tests. In the present study, three in house developed diagnostic tests 
      namely TB-Ag(antigen) ELISA, Adenosine deaminase (ADA) estimation and IS6110 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay were investigated for the detection of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb.) infection. METHODS: For investigation, blood 
      samples were collected from 128 study subjects from six villages of Melghat tribal 
      area and evaluated using three in house developed assays, namely TB-Ag ELISA, ADA 
      estimation and IS6110 PCR. RESULTS: The TB-Ag ELISA method yielded 83% sensitivity 
      and 94% specificity. The ADA and PCR assay gave a sensitivity of 61% and 49% and 
      specificity of 62% and 98% respectively. A considerable good agreement of 82.81% 
      (k=0.472) between TB-Ag ELISA and PCR was observed. The overall sensitivity of TB-Ag 
      ELISA was significantly higher (p<0.05) than the ADA and PCR while PCR yielded 
      highest specificity among all the three evaluated tests. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded 
      that the routine use of TB-Ag ELISA can be useful for screening of suspected TB 
      patients in the malnourished population where sophisticated laboratory set up is 
      difficult.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease that has been threatening public 
      health for many centuries. The clinical diagnostic procedure for TB is 
      time-consuming and laborious. In the last 20 years, real-time fluorescence-based 
      quantitative PCR (real-time PCR) has become a better alternative for TB diagnosis in 
      clinics due to its sensitivity and specificity. Recently, digital droplet PCR 
      (ddPCR) has been developed, and it might be an ideal alternative to conventional 
      real-time PCR for microorganism detection. In this study, we aimed to assess the 
      capacity of ddPCR and real-time PCR for detecting low levels of circulating 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA. The study involved testing whole blood samples 
      for an MTB DNA target (known as IS6110). Blood samples were obtained from 28 
      patients with pulmonary TB, 28 patients with extrapulmonary TB, and 28 healthy 
      individuals. The results show that ddPCR could be used to measure low levels of MTB 
      DNA, and it has the potential to be used to diagnose pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB 
      based on clinical samples.

TI  - Newer diagnostic modalities for tuberculosis.
PG  - 221-7
AB  - The gold standard for diagnosis of tuberculosis is demonstration of mycobacteria 
      from various body fluids. This is often not possible in children due to 
      pauci-bacillary nature of illness. Significant improvement in understanding of 
      molecular biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has led to development of newer 
      diagnostic techniques of tuberculosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an 
      emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosis of TB in children. However, its role in 
      day-to-day clinical practice needs to be defined. A negative PCR never eliminates 
      possibility of tuberculosis, and a positive result is not always confirmatory. The 
      PCR may be useful in evaluating children with significant pulmonary disease when 
      diagnosis is not readily established by other means, and in evaluating 
      immunocompromised children (HIV infection) with pulmonary disease. In the absence of 
      good diagnostic methods for tuberculosis, a lot of interest has been generated in 
      serodiagnosis. ELISA has been used to detect antibodies to various purified or 
      complex antigens of M. tuberculosis in children. Despite a large number of studies 
      published over the past several years, serology has found little place in the 
      routine diagnosis of tuberculosis in children, even though it is rapid and does not 
      require specimen from the site of disease. Sensitivity and specificity depend on the 
      antigen used, gold standard for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and the type of 
      tubercular infection. Though most of these tests have high specificity, their 
      sensitivity is poor. In addition, these tests may be influenced by factors such as 
      age, prior BCG vaccination and exposure to environmental mycobacteria. The 
      serological tests, theoretically, may not be able to differentiate between infection 
      and disease. At present, serodiagnosis does not appear to have any role in diagnosis 
      of childhood pulmonary tuberculosis. A new test (QuantiFERON-TB or QFT) that 
      measures the release of interferon-gamma in whole blood in response to stimulation 
      by purified protein derivative is comparable with the tuberculin skin testing to 
      detect latent tubercular infection, and is less affected by BCG vaccination. It can 
      also discriminate responses due to nontuberculous mycobacteria, and avoids 
      variability and subjectivity associated with placing and reading the tuberculin skin 
      test. Polymerase chain reaction based test for identification of katG and rpoB 
      mutation which are associated with isoniazid and rifampicin resistance may help in 
      early identification of drug resistance in mycobacterium.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High HIV burden countries have experienced a high burden of pleural TB 
      in HIV-infected patients. OBJECTIVE: To review the epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, 
      diagnosis, and treatment of pleural TB in HIV-infected patients. METHODS: A 
      literature search from 1950 to June 2011 in MEDLINE was conducted. RESULTS: 
      Two-hundred and ninety-nine studies were identified, of which 30 met the inclusion 
      criteria. The immunopathogenesis as denoted by cells and cytokine profiles is 
      distinctly different between HIV and HIV-uninfected pleural TB disease. Adenosine 
      deaminase and interferon gamma are good markers of pleural TB disease even in 
      HIV-infected patients. HIV-uninfected TB suspects with pleural effusions commonly 
      have a low yield of TB organisms however the evidence suggests that in dually 
      infected patients smear and cultures have a higher yield. The Gene Xpert MTB/RIF 
      assay has significant potential to improve the diagnosis of pleural TB in 
      HIV-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pleural TB in HIV-infected patients has a 
      different immunopathogenesis than HIV-uninfected pleural TB and these findings in 
      part support the differences noted in this systematic review. Research should focus 
      on developing an interferon gamma-based point of care diagnostic test and expansion 
      of the role of Gene Xpert in the diagnosis of pleural TB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare and potentially fatal 
      condition that can be primary or secondary. Secondary HLH due to Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (TB) is uncommon. We report a case of tuberculosis-associated HLH in an 
      umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) recipient and discuss its clinical 
      characteristics and challenges. METHODS: Hematologic investigations, bone marrow 
      aspirates, Xpert MTB/RIF test of TB with peripheral blood were performed. Immune 
      modulation with anti-TB therapy was initiated. RESULTS: Subsequent treatment with 
      anti-TB treatment resulted rapid clinical response and disease remission. 
      CONCLUSION: It is important to consider TB as one of the underlying cause of HLH in 
      high-risk patients, particularly those in immunodeficient states. Early diagnosis 
      and treatment can improve the survival rates of patients with 
      tuberculosis-associated HLH.

AB  - Cavities are important in clinical diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) infected 
      by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in the 
      regulation of inflammation, the relation between plasma miRNA and pulmonary 
      tuberculosis with cavity remains unknown. In this study, plasma samples were derived 
      from 89 cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis (CP-TB) patients, 89 non-cavitary pulmonary 
      tuberculosis (NCP-TB) patients and 95 healthy controls. Groups were matched for age 
      and gender. In the screening phase, Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology 
      was employed to analyze miRNA profiles in plasma samples pooled from CP-TB patients, 
      NCP-TB patients and healthy controls. During the training and verification phases, 
      quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted to verify the differential expression of 
      selected miRNAs among groups. Illumina high-throughput sequencing identified 29 
      differentially expressed plasma miRNAs in TB patients when compared to healthy 
      controls. Furthermore, qRT-PCR analysis validated miR-769-5p, miR-320a and miR-22-3p 
      as miRNAs that were differently present between TB patients and healthy controls. 
      ROC curve analysis revealed that the potential of these 3 miRNAs to distinguish TB 
      patients from healthy controls was high, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) 
      ranged from 0.692 to 0.970. Moreover, miR-320a levels were decreased in 
      drug-resistant TB patients than pan-susceptible TB patients (AUC = 0.882). In 
      conclusion, we identified miR-769-5p, miR-320a and miR-22-3p as potential 
      blood-based biomarkers for TB. In addition, miR-320a may represent a biomarker for 
      drug-resistant TB.

AB  - Simple effective tools to monitor the long treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are 
      lacking. Easily measured host derived biomarkers have been identified but need to be 
      validated in larger studies and different population groups. Here we investigate the 
      early response in IP-10 levels (between day 0 and day 7 of TB therapy) to identify 
      bacteriological status at diagnosis among 127 HIV-infected patients starting TB 
      treatment. All participants were then classified as responding or not responding to 
      treatment blindly using a previously described IP-10 kinetic algorithm. There were 
      77 bacteriologically confirmed cases and 41 Xpert MTB/RIF® and culture negative 
      cases. Most participants had a measurable decline in IP-10 during the first 7 days 
      of therapy. Bacteriologically confirmed cases were more likely to have high IP-10 
      levels at D0 and had a steeper decline than clinically diagnosed cases (mean decline 
      difference 2231 pg/dl, 95% CI: 897-3566, p = 0.0013). Bacteriologically confirmed 
      cases were more likely to have a measurable decline in IP-10 at day 7 than 
      clinically diagnosed cases (48/77 (62.3%) vs 13/41 (31.7%), p < 0.001). This study 
      confirms the association between a decrease in IP-10 levels during the first week of 
      treatment and a bacteriological confirmation at diagnosis in a large cohort of HIV 
      positive patients.

TI  - A Survey on Use of Rapid Tests and Tuberculosis Diagnostic Practices by Primary 
      Health Care Providers in South Africa: Implications for the Development of New 
      Point-of-Care Tests.
PG  - e0141453
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0141453 [doi]
LID - e0141453
AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective infectious disease control requires early diagnosis and 
      treatment initiation. Point-of-care testing offers rapid turn-around-times, 
      facilitating same day clinical management decisions. To maximize the benefits of 
      such POC testing programs, we need to understand how rapid tests are used in 
      everyday clinical practice. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey study, 400 
      primary healthcare providers in two cities in South Africa were interviewed on their 
      use of rapid tests in general, and tuberculosis diagnostic practices, between 
      September 2012 and June 2013. Public healthcare facilities were selected using 
      probability-sampling techniques and private healthcare providers were randomly 
      selected from the Health Professional Council of South Africa list. To ascertain 
      differences between the two healthcare sectors 2-sample z-tests were used to compare 
      sample proportions. RESULTS: The numbers of providers interviewed were equally 
      distributed between the public (n = 200) and private sector (n = 200). The most 
      frequently reported tests in the private sector include blood pressure (99.5%), 
      glucose finger prick (89.5%) and urine dipstick (38.5%); and in the public sector 
      were pregnancy (100%), urine dipstick (100%), blood pressure (100%), glucose finger 
      prick (99%) and HIV rapid test (98%). The majority of TB testing occurs in the 
      public sector, where significantly more providers prefer Xpert MTB/RIF assay, the 
      designated clinical TB diagnostic tool by the national TB program, as compared to 
      the private sector (87% versus 71%, p-value >0.0001). Challenges with regard to TB 
      diagnosis included the long laboratory turn-around-time, difficulty in obtaining 
      sputum samples and lost results. All providers indicated that a new POC test for TB 
      should be rapid and cheap, have good sensitivity and specificity, ease of sample 
      acquisition, detect drug-resistance and work in HIV-infected persons. 
      CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The existing centralized laboratory services, poor quality 
      assurance, and lack of staff capacity deter the use of more rapid tests at POC. 
      Further research into the practices and choices of these providers is necessary to 
      aid the development of new POC tests.

      tuberculosis.

LID - 3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious infectious disease in that 90% of those 
      latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis present no symptoms, but possess a 
      10% lifetime chance of developing active TB. To prevent the spread of the disease, 
      early diagnosis is crucial. However, current methods of detection require 
      improvement in sensitivity, efficiency or specificity. In the present study, we 
      conducted a microarray experiment, comparing the gene expression profiles in the 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells among individuals with active TB, latent 
      infection, and healthy conditions in a Taiwanese population. RESULTS: Bioinformatics 
      analysis revealed that most of the differentially expressed genes belonged to immune 
      responses, inflammation pathways, and cell cycle control. Subsequent RT-PCR 
      validation identified four differentially expressed genes, NEMF, ASUN, DHX29, and 
      PTPRC, as potential biomarkers for the detection of active and latent TB infections. 
      Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the expression level of PTPRC 
      may discriminate active TB patients from healthy individuals, while ASUN could 
      differentiate between the latent state of TB infection and healthy condidtion. In 
      contrast, DHX29 may be used to identify latently infected individuals among active 
      TB patients or healthy individuals. To test the concept of using these biomarkers as 
      diagnostic support, we constructed classification models using these candidate 
      biomarkers and found the Naïve Bayes-based model built with ASUN, DHX29, and PTPRC 
      to yield the best performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that gene 
      expression profiles in the blood can be used to identify not only active TB 
      patients, but also to differentiate latently infected patients from their healthy 
      counterparts. Validation of the constructed computational model in a larger sample 
      size would confirm the reliability of the biomarkers and facilitate the development 
      of a cost-effective and sensitive molecular diagnostic platform for TB.

TI  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection in blood using multiplex nested polymerase 
      chain reaction.

LID - 10.5588/ijtld.12.0536 [doi]
AB  - SETTING: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers great promise for the rapid, 
      sensitive and specific diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). However, blood TB PCR is 
      still not standardised. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the Blacklight® Card to standardise 
      TB PCR in blood samples using a multiplex nested PCR method targeting insertion 
      sequence 6110 and MPB64 sequence for use as an auxiliary tool in the diagnosis of 
      TB. DESIGN: The study focused on the standardisation of the Blacklight Card as a new 
      extraction tool and its evaluation using 130 blood samples randomly collected from 
      patients with clinical symptoms of TB. RESULTS: Of 130 cases, PCR was positive in 22 
      samples (17%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 
      respectively 95.7% and 100%; the positive and negative predictive values were 
      respectively 85.1% and 99.2%. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that for the 
      detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 
      the Blacklight Card may be a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of disseminated and 
      extra-pulmonary forms of TB as well as in difficult-to-diagnose cases in which a 
      diagnosis is urgently needed due to the severity of the patient's status.

TI  - Serum protein profiles in domestic pigeons naturally infected with Mycobacterium 
      avium subsp. avium.
PG  - 212-5
LID - 10.1111/vcp.12033 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Avian tuberculosis is an important disease affecting all species of 
      birds and is most often caused by Mycobacterium avium or Mycobacterium genavense. 
      Blood proteins are important diagnostic constituents in gastrointestinal, hepatic, 
      renal, and infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare serum 
      protein profiles of domestic pigeons (Columba livia var. domestica) infected with 
      Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (MAA), with healthy pigeons. METHODS: Serum samples 
      were collected from 80 pigeons with clinical signs of tuberculosis, all kept in the 
      same loft. All birds were necropsied and cultured for mycobacteriosis; positive 
      cultures were typed for MAA by PCR reactions targeting 16S rRNA, IS901 and IS1245. 
      The concentration of total serum proteins was determined by the biuret method and 
      spectrophotometry. Individual protein fractions were analyzed by cellulose acetate 
      electrophoresis and extrapolated based on total protein concentration. For 
      statistical analysis, the infected birds were compared with healthy pigeons. 
      RESULTS: A total of 37 pigeons with culture results positive for MAA were selected 
      and allocated to 2 groups, a culture-positive group with macroscopic lesions of 
      tuberculosis and another without macroscopic lesions. Six protein fractions were 
      identified: prealbumin, albumin, alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta globulins and gamma 
      globulins. Concentrations of total protein, beta globulins and gamma globulins were 
      statistically significantly higher in the infected pigeons when compared with the 
      control group. There were no significant differences between the groups of birds 
      with or without macroscopic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant 
      differences in total protein, and beta and gamma globulin concentrations in all 
      infected pigeons suggest that serum protein electrophoresis represents a nonspecific 
      but valuable indicator for tuberculosis in pigeons.

TI  - Dietary Vitamin D3 Suppresses Pulmonary Immunopathology Associated with Late-Stage 
      Tuberculosis in C3HeB/FeJ Mice.
PG  - 1293-304
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1500931 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant human disease caused by inhalation of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Left untreated, TB mortality is associated with a 
      failure to resolve pulmonary immunopathology. There is currently widespread interest 
      in using vitamin D3 (VitD3) as an adjunct therapy for TB because numerous in vitro 
      studies have shown that VitD3 has direct and indirect mycobactericidal activities. 
      However, to date, there have been no in vivo studies addressing whether VitD3 
      affects experimental TB outcome. In this study, we used C3HeB/FeJ mice to determine 
      whether dietary VitD3 influences the outcome of experimental TB. We observed that 
      although M. tuberculosis burdens did not differ between mice on a VitD3-replete diet 
      (VitD(HI) mice) and mice on a VitD3-deficient diet (VitD(LO) mice), the inflammatory 
      response in VitD(HI) mice was significantly attenuated relative to VitD(LO) 
      controls. Specifically, the expression of multiple inflammatory pathways was reduced 
      in the lungs at later disease stages as were splenocyte IL12/23p40 and IFN-γ levels 
      following ex vivo restimulation. Dietary VitD3 also suppressed the accumulation of T 
      cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes and lung granulomatous regions while 
      concomitantly accelerating the accumulation of F4/80(+) and Ly6C/Ly6G(+) lineages. 
      The altered inflammatory profile of VitD(HI) mice also associated with reductions in 
      pulmonary immunopathology. VitD receptor-deficient (vdr(-/-)) radiation bone marrow 
      chimeras demonstrate that reductions in pulmonary TB immunopathology are dependent 
      on hematopoietic VitD responsiveness. Collectively, our data support a model wherein 
      the in vivo role of VitD3 during TB is not to promote M. tuberculosis killing but 
      rather to function through hematopoietic cells to reduce M. tuberculosis-elicited 
      immunopathology.

AB  - Bovine γδ T cells are amongst the first cells to accumulate at the site of 
      Mycobacterium bovis infection; however, their role in the developing lesion remains 
      unclear. We utilized transcriptomics analysis, in situ hybridization, and a 
      macrophage/γδ T cell co-culture system to elucidate the role of γδ T cells in local 
      immunity to M. bovis infection. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that γδ T cells 
      upregulated expression of several novel, immune-associated genes in response to 
      stimulation with M. bovis antigen. BCG-infected macrophage/γδ T cell co-cultures 
      confirmed the results of our RNAseq analysis, and revealed that γδ T cells from M. 
      bovis-infected animals had a significant impact on bacterial viability. Analysis of 
      γδ T cells within late-stage M. bovis granulomas revealed significant expression of 
      IFN-γ and CCL2, but not IL-10, IL-22, or IL-17. Our results suggest γδ T cells 
      influence local immunity to M. bovis through cytokine secretion and direct effects 
      on bacterial burden.

AB  - Nucleic acid amplification tests are a major diagnostic tool for pulmonary 
      tuberculosis (PTB). Recently, digital PCR (dPCR) assay has improved sensitivity for 
      the detection of small copy numbers of target molecules. The aim of this study is to 
      explore the utility of dPCR for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA in 
      PTB patient plasma. Total DNA was purified from plasma samples of newly diagnosed 
      sputum smear-positive PTB patients. Copy numbers of MTB-specific genes in the 
      samples were quantified with dPCR assays targeted for IS6110 or gyrB. A total of 33 
      PTB patients were enrolled. Significant differences between PTB patients and 
      controls were observed in copy numbers of both targets: IS6110 mean ± SD, 
      144.8 ± 538.3 vs 0.44 ± 0.49 (copies/20 μL, p = 0.004; Mann-Whitney U test) and gyrB 
      mean ± SD, 359.0 ± 2116 vs 0.07 ± 0.28 (copies/20 μL, p = 0.011; Mann-Whitney U 
      test), respectively. This test had sensitivities of 65% or 29% and a specificity of 
      93% or 100% with the IS6110-targeted or gyrB-targeted assays, respectively. A dPCR 
      assay successfully detected MTB DNA in PTB patient plasma. This minimally invasive 
      and accurate method has potential to become an alternative diagnostic option.

AB  - The measurement of bovine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) forms the basis of a diagnostic 
      test for bovine tuberculosis where Mycobacterium bovis sensitised effector T cells 
      produce IFN-γ following in vitro stimulation with tuberculin antigens. In cattle 
      infected with M. bovis it is also known that the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine 
      can inhibit in vitro production of IFN-γ leading to a reduced response in the IFN-γ 
      diagnostic test. In order to investigate this in greater detail, whole blood samples 
      from tuberculin skin test positive and negative cattle were stimulated with bovine 
      and avian tuberculin antigens and in parallel with a neutralising anti-IL-10 
      monoclonal antibody. The results showed that IFN-γ protein levels increased when 
      IL-10 activity was suppressed by Anti - IL-10. By using a standard diagnostic 
      interpretation, the elevated levels of IFN-γ were shown to change the level of 
      agreement between the performance of the single intradermal comparative tuberculin 
      test (SICTT) and IFN-γ assay, depending on the tuberculin treatment. A 
      transcriptomic analysis using RT-qPCR investigated the influence of IL-10 activity 
      on expression of a suite of cytokine genes (IFNG, IL12B, IL10 and CXCL10) associated 
      with antigen-stimulated production of IFN-γ. The IFNG and IL12B genes both 
      experienced significant increases in expression in the presence of Anti-IL-10, while 
      the expression of IL10 and CXCL10 remained unaffected.

TI  - Exploring alternative biomaterials for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in 
      HIV-negative patients by use of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay.
PG  - 4161-6
LID - 10.1128/JCM.01743-13 [doi]
AB  - The utility of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay for detection of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis in sputum samples has been extensively studied. However, the 
      performance of the Xpert assay as applied to other readily accessible body fluids 
      such as exhaled breath condensate (EBC), saliva, urine, and blood has not been 
      established. We used the Xpert assay to test EBC, saliva, urine, and blood samples 
      from HIV-negative, smear- and culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients 
      for the presence of M. tuberculosis. To compare the ability of the assay to perform 
      bacterial load measurements on sputum samples with versus without sample processing, 
      the assay was also performed on paired direct and processed sputum samples from each 
      patient. The Xpert assay detected M. tuberculosis in none of the 26 EBC samples 
      (sensitivity, 0.0%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.0%, 12.9%), 10 of the 26 
      saliva samples (sensitivity, 38.5%; 95% CI, 22.4%, 57.5%), 1 of 26 urine samples 
      (sensitivity, 3.8%; 95% CI, 0.7%, 18.9%), and 2 of 24 blood samples (sensitivity, 
      8.3%; 95% CI, 2.3%, 25.8%). For bacterial load measurements in the different types 
      of sputum samples, the cycle thresholds of the two M. tuberculosis-positive sputum 
      types were well correlated (Spearman correlation of 0.834). This study demonstrates 
      that the Xpert assay should not be routinely used to detect M. tuberculosis in EBC, 
      saliva, urine, or blood samples from HIV-negative patients suspected of having 
      pulmonary tuberculosis. As a test of bacterial load, the assay produced similar 
      results when used to test direct versus processed sputum samples. Sputum remains the 
      optimal sample type for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative patients 
      with the Xpert assay.

TI  - Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in blood by use of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay.
PG  - 2317-22
LID - 10.1128/JCM.00332-13 [doi]
AB  - We have developed a novel blood lysis-centrifugation approach for highly sensitive 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection in large volumes of blood with the Xpert 
      MTB/RIF assay. One through 20 ml of blood was spiked with 0.25 to 10 CFU/ml of the 
      M. tuberculosis surrogate M. bovis BCG. Multiple replicates of each sample were 
      processed by a new lysis-centrifugation method and tested with the Xpert MTB/RIF 
      assay. The assay was very sensitive with increased blood volumes. In the 20-ml 
      samples, BCG was detected in blood spiked with 10, 5, 1, and 0.25 CFU/ml 100, 100, 
      83, and 57% of the time, respectively, compared to 100, 66, 18, and 18%, of the 
      time, respectively, in 1-ml blood samples. Assay sensitivity was influenced by the 
      type of anticoagulant used, with acid-citrate-dextrose solution B (ACD-B) providing 
      the best results. A limit of detection of 10 CFU/ml was established with BCG spiked 
      into ACD-B-treated blood, and 92, 36, and 33% of the samples with 5, 1, and 0.5 
      CFU/ml, respectively, were assay positive. The lysis buffer was stable both at room 
      temperature and at 4°C for 2 months. The assay was tested with blood stored for 8 
      days without a change in sensitivity as measured by cycle threshold. This new assay 
      format extends the capability of the Xpert MTB/RIF test, enabling up to 20 ml of 
      blood to be tested rapidly for the presence of M. tuberculosis. This approach may be 
      a useful method to detect extrapulmonary tuberculosis and the risk of death in 
      immunocompromised patients.

TI  - Quality control in nucleic acid testing--where do we stand?
PG  - S13-21
AB  - Quality control has been playing an increasingly important role in the 
      implementation of nucleic acid amplification techniques (NATs) for clinical 
      diagnosis since the introduction of these methods in the early 1990s. Initial 
      multicenter studies involving hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) revealed 
      serious problems in specificity (false-positive rates of ca. 40%) and sensitivity, 
      large variations in quantitative results, and a plethora of units (largely not 
      comparable between assays). The problem areas identified included the need for 
      standardized reagents and common units, contamination control mechanisms, inhibition 
      control mechanisms, genotype-independent detection and quantitation, facilitated 
      nucleic acid isolation procedures, clinically relevant dynamic ranges, and internal 
      run controls. Progress made in each of these areas will be discussed. In addition to 
      the above-mentioned problem areas, the value of external quality control of existing 
      and evolving NATs was recognized. To this end, the European Union Quality Control 
      Concerted Action for Nucleic Acid Amplification in Diagnostic Virology was 
      established in May 1998. During its three-and-a-half years of existence, a total of 
      14 proficiency panels containing 8-13 well-characterized, simulated clinical samples 
      of various viral loads and genotypes were prepared for herpesviruses (herpes simplex 
      virus, human cytomegalovirus), blood-borne viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV-1), enteroviruses, 
      and Chlamydia trachomatis, distributed to up to 20 different countries, and tested 
      by up to 97 different laboratories. The results show dramatic improvement in 
      specificity (false-positive rates <3% for most panels), presumably due to a 
      generally greater expertise of participating laboratories, more frequent use of 
      enzymatic or mechanical contamination control mechanisms, and increased utilization 
      of standardized reagents (commercial kits). However, considerable problems with 
      sensitivity remain (false-negative rates up to 50%), reflecting the high detection 
      limits of some commercial viral load kits still on the market as well as inadequate 
      standardization of quantitation controls between assay systems. In conclusion, 
      although considerable progress has been made, quality control of NATs in clinical 
      diagnosis remains an ongoing challenge.

AB  - This study reports on the diagnostic potential of IFN-γ release assays and serology 
      for Mycobacterium bovis in six naturally M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) 
      exposed bulls of which four were intratracheally infected with a Belgian field 
      strain of M. bovis. Heparinized blood, serum and fecal samples were collected at 
      regular time intervals for mycobacteria-specific IFN-γ release assays, antibody 
      analysis and for Map culture respectively. Single intradermal skin test (SIT) with 
      bovine tuberculin (PPD-B) was performed on day 115 and animals were sacrificed on 
      day 133 after M. bovis infection. Organs were collected and stored for 
      histopathological examination, modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining and bacteriological 
      analysis of M. bovis and Map by culture and RT-PCR. Prior to infection five animals 
      showed positive IFN-γ responses to avian PPD (PPD-A) and four were positive in Map 
      PCR (IS900) on faeces. Three M. bovis infected animals reacted as early as day 14 
      with sustained higher PPD-B than PPD-A specific IFN-γ responses, whereas the fourth 
      animal (with the strongest PPD-A response prior to infection) showed sustained 
      higher PPD-B specific IFN-γ levels only a day 56 after infection. Two of the 
      infected animals had a sustained positive IFN-γ response to the ESAT-6/CFP-10/TB7.7 
      (QuantiFERON(®)-TB Gold) peptide cocktail as early as day 14, among which the animal 
      with the initial high PPD-A response. Later during infection, positive responses 
      were found to ESAT-6 peptides in three infected bulls and to CFP-10 peptides in all 
      four infected bulls. One of the control animals reacted intermittently to the 
      ESAT-6/CFP10/TB7.7 cocktail. Prior to SIT, weak but positive MPB83/MBP70 specific 
      antibody responses were detected in two of the infected bulls. All four M. bovis 
      infected bulls reacted with a positive skin test and showed, as reported by others, 
      increased mycobacteria specific IFN-γ production and increased positive responses in 
      MPB83/MBP70 specific serology after SIT. At autopsy, M. bovis lesions were detected 
      in all four experimentally infected bulls. Our results indicate that in Map exposed 
      cattle, M. bovis diagnosis using IFN-γ assays needs a combination of PPD-B/A and 
      ESAT-6/CFP10 for early and optimal sensitivity and that sensitivity of MPB83/MBP70 
      serodiagnosis is dramatically increased by prior skin testing. Map exposure did not 
      interfere with the development of SIT in M. bovis infected animals, but resulted in 
      a false positive M. bovis specific IFN-γ and antibody response after SIT in one of 
      the two control animals (which remained negative in skin-test).

TI  - [Diagnostics for pulmonary tuberculosis in adults].
PG  - 489-90, 492-4, 496
AB  - The incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is decreasing in Western Europe. 
      However, TB should not be considered to be a rare disease, particularly in 
      immigrants and in immunocompromised persons (i.e. HIV infection). The clinical 
      presentation is often atypical in immunocompromised persons. In general, the extent 
      of the disease is underestimated by the clinical presentation. X-ray and a 
      sequential investigation of three samples of sputum including microscopy, culture 
      and susceptibility testing for the first-line drugs should be obtained. Tuberculin 
      testing is useful in the diagnosis of latent TB and in screening persons with close 
      contact to patients with active disease. New blood tests based on the detection of 
      interferon-g released by antigen specific T-cells have some advantages compared to 
      tuberculin testing.

TI  - Association of IL-37 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to tuberculosis in Saudi 
      subjects.
PG  - 778-786
LID - 10.1111/1348-0421.12444 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide. IL-37, a 
      novel member of the IL-1 family, has anti-inflammatory activity. Various cytokine 
      genes polymorphisms are reportedly associated with susceptibility to TB infection. 
      However, an association between genetic variations in the IL-37 gene and 
      susceptibility to TB infection has not been investigated. The aim of this 
      case-control study was therefore to identify such an association in Saudi subjects, 
      in which five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-37 gene were 
      assessed. Serum concentrations of IL-37 were evaluated using ELISA, and genetic 
      variants genotyped by multiplex PCR and ligase detection reaction. It was found that 
      the C/C genotype of rs2723176 (-6962 A/C) occurs significantly more frequently in 
      patients with active TB and that the C allele of this SNP is associated with TB. In 
      addition, the C allele of rs2723176 SNP was associated with high circulating 
      concentrations of IL-37. However, the genotype and allele frequency of the other 
      four SNPs (rs3811046, rs3811047, rs2723186 and rs2723187) were not significantly 
      associated with TB infection. In conclusion, the present data suggest that rs2723176 
      SNP of IL-37 is involved in the development of TB infection. Furthermore, high 
      circulating concentrations of IL-37 may have a negative effect on protective 
      immunity against TB infection.

AB  - Microscopic examination of sputum smears (search for acid-fast bacilli or AFB) is 
      the most rapid procedure for diagnosis of contagious tuberculosis. Gene 
      amplification is not yet reliable for direct detection of M. tuberculosis in 
      clinical specimens that are AFB smear-negative. Culture (3 to 8 weeks on 
      Lowenstein-Jensen medium or 1 to 4 weeks in liquid media) remains essential to 
      identify AFB and conduct antibiotic susceptibility testing. AFB from culture can be 
      identified in a few hours by molecular approaches with specific DNA probes. Results 
      of susceptibility testing, even in liquid media, are not available until 2 to 4 
      weeks after the recovery of specimens, although mutations of the rpoB and katG 315 
      genes, which confer resistance to rifampin and isoniazid, can be detected within 
      hours by molecular hybridization with specific probes fixed on strips. Immunologic 
      tests that measure the interferon gamma produced by sensitized lymphocytes are 
      promising tools for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Mycobacterium bovis frequently infects wild and farm deer 
      species with tuberculosis. This study investigated mycobacterial infection in two 
      native deer species Cervus unicolor swinhoei (Formosan Sambar, Sambar) and C. nippon 
      taiouanus (Formasan Sika, Sika). METHODS: Based on different sampling sources of 19 
      intradermal tuberculin test (ITT) Sambar, mycobacterial infection and/or species 
      were detected by acid-fast stain, duplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
      multiplex nested PCR (mnPCR) methods, traditional mycobacterial culture and gross 
      lesion. Blood samples of 167 Sambar deer and 147 Sika deer were then tested by 
      duplex PCR and mnPCR methods to investigate the prevalence of mycobacterial 
      infection. Sequence variations of these mycobacterial species were analyzed as well. 
      RESULTS: Duplex PCR and mnPCR assays could differentiate between MTBC (M. bovis and 
      M. tuberculosis) and M. avium, as well as between M. bovis and M. tuberculosis, 
      respectively. These PCR methods showed a higher detection rate than traditional 
      culture and matched the gross lesions examined in 19 ITT-examined Sambar. Therefore, 
      the mycobacterial infection in blood samples of 314 deer samples was detected using 
      these PCR methods. Duplex PCR and mnPCR showed an identical prevalence of 16.1% in 
      Sambar and 8.2% in Sika and a significant difference in prevalence between these two 
      deer species. M. bovis and M. tuberculosis were the species detected in feedlot 
      Sambar and Sika. M. tuberculosis was found only and first in Sambar fed in central 
      Taiwan. Sequence analysis revealed diverse genetic variations in M. bovis and M. 
      tuberculosis associated with deer subspecies. CONCLUSION: Multiplex PCR methods were 
      established, and M. bovis and M. tuberculosis were identified in feedlot deer in 
      Taiwan. Sequence variations indicated diverse sources of both mycobacterial species.

TI  - Diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis and host RNA expression in Africa.
PG  - 1712-1723
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1303657 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Improved diagnostic tests for tuberculosis in children are needed. We 
      hypothesized that transcriptional signatures of host blood could be used to 
      distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in African children who either were or 
      were not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). METHODS: The study 
      population comprised prospective cohorts of children who were undergoing evaluation 
      for suspected tuberculosis in South Africa (655 children), Malawi (701 children), 
      and Kenya (1599 children). Patients were assigned to groups according to whether the 
      diagnosis was culture-confirmed tuberculosis, culture-negative tuberculosis, 
      diseases other than tuberculosis, or latent tuberculosis infection. Diagnostic 
      signatures distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases and from latent 
      tuberculosis infection were identified from genomewide analysis of RNA expression in 
      host blood. RESULTS: We identified a 51-transcript signature distinguishing 
      tuberculosis from other diseases in the South African and Malawian children (the 
      discovery cohort). In the Kenyan children (the validation cohort), a risk score 
      based on the signature for tuberculosis and for diseases other than tuberculosis 
      showed a sensitivity of 82.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.6 to 94.3) and a 
      specificity of 83.6% (95% CI, 74.6 to 92.7) for the diagnosis of culture-confirmed 
      tuberculosis. Among patients with cultures negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      who were treated for tuberculosis (those with highly probable, probable, or possible 
      cases of tuberculosis), the estimated sensitivity was 62.5 to 82.3%, 42.1 to 80.8%, 
      and 35.3 to 79.6%, respectively, for different estimates of actual tuberculosis in 
      the groups. In comparison, the sensitivity of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for molecular 
      detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in cases of culture-confirmed tuberculosis was 
      54.3% (95% CI, 37.1 to 68.6), and the sensitivity in highly probable, probable, or 
      possible cases was an estimated 25.0 to 35.7%, 5.3 to 13.3%, and 0%, respectively; 
      the specificity of the assay was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: RNA expression signatures 
      provided data that helped distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in African 
      children with and those without HIV infection. (Funded by the European Union Action 
      for Diseases of Poverty Program and others).

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant human health issue. More effective 
      biomarkers for use in tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, including 
      markers that can discriminate between healthy individuals and those with latent 
      infection, are urgently needed. To identify a set of such markers, we used Solexa 
      sequencing to examine microRNA expression in the serum of patients with active 
      disease, healthy individuals with latent TB, and those with or without prior BCG 
      inoculation. We identified 24 microRNAs that are up-regulated (2.85-1285.93 fold) 
      and 6 microRNAs that are down-regulated (0.003-0.11 fold) (P<0.05) in patients with 
      active TB relative to the three groups of healthy controls. In addition, 75 
      microRNAs were up-regulated (2.05-2454.58 fold) and 11 were down-regulated 
      (0.001-0.42 fold) (P<0.05) in latent-TB infected individuals relative to BCG- 
      inoculated individuals. Of interest, 134 microRNAs were differentially-expressed in 
      BCG-inoculated relative to un-inoculated individuals (18 up-regulated 2.9-499.29 
      fold, 116 down-regulated 0.0002-0.5 fold), providing insights into the effects of 
      BCG inoculation at the microRNA level. Target prediction of differentially-expressed 
      microRNAs by microRNA-Gene Network analysis and analysis of pathways affected 
      suggest that regulation of the host immune system by microRNAs is likely to be one 
      of the main factors in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. qRT-PCR validation 
      indicated that hsa-miR-196b and hsa-miR-376c have potential as markers for active TB 
      disease. The microRNA differential-expression profiles generated in this study 
      provide a good foundation for the development of markers for TB diagnosis, and for 
      investigations on the role of microRNAs in BCG-inoculated and latent-infected 
      individuals.

TI  - Circulating granulysin levels in healthcare workers and latent tuberculosis 
      infection estimated using interferon-gamma release assays.
PG  - 580
LID - 580
AB  - BACKGROUND: Granulysin (GNLY) is produced by human lymphocyte subpopulations and 
      exhibits antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We examined the 
      association between GNLY levels in blood and latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. 
      METHODS: Latency of TB infection among Vietnamese healthcare workers was estimated 
      using interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), and serum GNLY concentrations were 
      measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The levels of GNLY expression in 
      whole blood and the presence of GNLY alleles with the exon-4 polymorphism rs11127 
      were also determined using PCR-based methods. RESULTS: Among 109 study participants, 
      41 (37.6 %) were IGRA positive and had significantly lower serum GNLY concentrations 
      compared with IGRA-negative participants (adjusted mean, 95 % confidence interval; 
      2.03, 1.72-2.44 vs. 2.48, 2.10-2.92 ng/ml, P = 0.0127; analysis of covariance). 
      Serum GNLY concentrations and TB antigen-stimulated interferon-gamma values were 
      weakly inversely correlated (r = -0.20, P = 0.0333). Serum GNLY concentrations 
      varied with GNLY genotypes even after adjustment for gender and age (adjusted P = 
      0.0015) and were moderately correlated with GNLY expression in blood cells (r = 
      0.40, P < 0.0001). In subsequent analyses, low serum GNLY concentrations were 
      significantly associated with IGRA status (adjusted odds ratio and 95 % confidence 
      interval, 0.55 and 0.31-0.98, respectively), although GNLY genotype and mRNA levels 
      were not. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased GNLY, presumably at the protein level, is linked to 
      the immunological condition of latent TB infection.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare two diagnostic methods for the detection of 
      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection in lymph nodes with granulomatous 
      lymphadenitis from slaughtered domestic pigs. Fifty affected lymph nodes were 
      collected from 50 pigs and examined microscopically and by polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR). Microscopically, granulomatous lesions were observed in 92% of the samples, 
      consisting mostly of central necrosis (78%) with dystrophic calcification (46%) and 
      associated with inflammatory infiltration by epithelioid giant cells, lymphocytes, 
      neutrophils (92%), eosinophils (60%) and Langhans-type cells (70%). In 64% of the 
      lesions, a capsule of connective tissue was found. Acid-fast bacilli were observed 
      in all cases. PCR detected DNA from Mycobacterium spp. in 82% (41/50) of the lymph 
      nodes. MAC was confirmed in 58% (24/41) and M. avium avium/silvaticum subspecies in 
      39% (16/41). The results of this study suggest that combined histopathology and PCR 
      of lymph nodes are useful in the diagnosis of granulomatous lymphadenitis in 
      slaughtered pigs.

TI  - Diagnosis of tuberculosis and drug resistance: what can new tools bring us?
PG  - 860-70
LID - 10.5588/ijtld.12.0180 [doi]
AB  - This is an exciting time for tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics. The technology for rapid 
      diagnosis of TB and rifampicin (RMP) resistance in pulmonary sputum smear-positive 
      specimens is well advanced, and assays have high specificity with good sensitivity. 
      Nevertheless, the current sensitivity of TB detection means that these assays still 
      cannot replace the standard diagnostic methods for TB or conventional drug 
      susceptibility testing (DST). In extra-pulmonary specimens, the performance of 
      molecular tools varies and should be considered separately for each specimen type. 
      Evidence for the use of these assays for TB and drug resistance detection in 
      individuals co-infected with TB and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is 
      limited. As the positive predictive value for RMP resistance reaches ≥ 90% only when 
      the prevalence of RMP resistance in new TB patients is >15%, which is rare globally, 
      many cases with such resistance will be false-resistant, emphasising the need for a 
      secondary confirmative test. Similarly, increased (or incorrect) diagnosis of TB may 
      compromise programme effectiveness by increasing the numbers of individuals 
      requiring anti-tuberculosis treatment, unless it is carefully planned. For the 
      future, 1) assays with greater sensitivity for TB detection are needed; 2) rapid 
      diagnostics for paediatric TB are important, and there is a need for carefully 
      designed studies, including those involving HIV-positive children; 3) more clinical 
      data need to be obtained from longitudinal studies, especially related to the 
      influence of rapid diagnostics on disease outcome; and 4) point-of-care tests using 
      untreated sputum, blood or urine and little or no equipment would be of immeasurable 
      benefit. Although great progress has been made, we are not there yet.

TI  - The circular RNA of peripheral blood mononuclear cells: Hsa_circ_0005836 as a new

AB  - It has been reported that circular RNA (circRNA) is associated with human cancer. 
      However, few studies have been reported in active pulmonary tuberculosis (APTB). The 
      global circRNA expression was detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMCs) of APTB patients (n=5) and health controls (HC) (n=5) by using 
      high-throughput sequencing. According to the systematical bioinformatics analysis, 
      the basic content of circRNAs and their fold changes in the two groups were 
      calculated. We selected 6 significant differentially expressed circRNAs, 
      hsa_circ_0005836, hsa_circ_0009128, hsa_circ_0003519, hsa_circ_0023956, 
      hsa_circ_0078768, and hsa_circ_0088452 and validated the expression in PBMCs from 
      APTB (n=10) and HC (n=10) by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase 
      chain reactions (qRT-PCRs). Further, the verification of these specific circRNAs 
      (hsa_circ_0005836 and hsa_circ_0009128) between APTB (n=34) and HC (n=30) in PBMCs 
      was also conducted by qRT-PCRs. The RNA-seq data showed the significant differential 
      expression of the 523 circRNAs between the APTB and HC groups (199 circRNAs were 
      significantly up-regulated and 324 circRNAs were down-regulated). Hsa_circ_0005836 
      and hsa_circ_0009128 expression was significantly down-regulated in the PBMCs of 
      APTB (P<0.05) in the samples of APTB compared to HC in our study. The gene ontology 
      based enrichment analysis of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNAs network showed that cellular 
      catabolic process (P=7.10E-08), regulation of metabolic process (P=2.10E-06), 
      catalytic activity (P=3.67E-08), protein binding (P=1.71E-07), cell part 
      (P=3.46E-06), intracellular part (P=1.71E-07), and intracellular (P=3.67E-08) were 
      recognized in the comparisons between APTB and HC. Based on KEGG analysis, HTLV-I 
      infection, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, neurotrophin signaling pathway and mTOR 
      signaling pathway were relevant during tuberculosis bacillus infection. We found for 
      the first time that hsa_circ_0005836 and hsa_circ_0009128 were significantly 
      down-regulated in the PBMCs of APTB compared with HC. Our findings indicate 
      hsa_circ_0005836 might serve as a novel potential biomarker for TB infection.

TI  - Modified TB rapid test by proteinase K for rapid diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis.
PG  - 201-7
LID - 10.1111/apm.12490 [doi]
AB  - The diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis continues to be a challenge due to the low 
      sensitivity of traditional diagnostic methods. Better and more rapid tests are 
      needed for diagnosis of pleural TB. In this study, pleural fluids were tested with 
      rapid test to determine Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB antigen). Affinity 
      chromatography was used to purify specific polyclonal antibodies against MTB 
      antigen. Pleural samples after decontamination were treated with proteinase K. Rapid 
      test for pleural fluids was prepared by specific antibody. Rapid test was performed 
      on 85 pleural fluid patients. The patients had a mean age of 46.55 ± 15.96 years and 
      38 were men. The performance of rapid test, using proteinase K, was found to be the 
      most impressive: sensitivity 93%, specificity 94%, PPV 90%, and NPV 96% compared 
      with adenosine deaminase test (ADA), PCR, smear, and culture. The present study did 
      demonstrate that modified TB rapid test can substantially improve the diagnosis of 
      extrapulmonary TB.

TI  - Early control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection requires il12rb1 expression by 
      rag1-dependent lineages.
PG  - 3828-41
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00426-12 [doi]
AB  - IL12RB1 is essential for human resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. 
      In the absence of a functional IL12RB1 allele, individuals exhibit susceptibility to 
      disseminated, recurrent mycobacterial infections that are associated with defects in 
      both RAG1-dependent and RAG1-independent hematopoietic lineages. Despite this 
      well-established association, a causal relationship between M. tuberculosis 
      susceptibility and IL12RB1 deficiency in either RAG1-dependent or RAG1-independent 
      lineages has never been formally tested. Here, we use the low-dose aerosol model of 
      experimental tuberculosis (TB) to both establish that infected il12rb1(-/-) mice 
      recapitulate important aspects of TB in IL12RB1 null individuals and, more 
      importantly, use radiation bone marrow chimeras to demonstrate that restriction of 
      il12rb1 deficiency solely to rag1-dependent lineages (i.e., T and B cells) allows 
      for the full transfer of the il12rb1(-/-) phenotype. We further demonstrate that the 
      protection afforded by adaptive lymphocyte il12rb1 expression is mediated partially 
      through ifng and that, within the same infection, il12rb1-sufficient T cells exhibit 
      dominance over il12rb1-deficient T cells by enhancing ifng expression in the latter 
      population. Collectively, our data establish a basic framework in which to 
      understand how IL12RB1 promotes control of this significant human disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical and epidemiological significance of HIV-associated 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis bloodstream infection (BSI) is incompletely understood. 
      We hypothesised that M tuberculosis BSI prevalence has been underestimated, that it 
      independently predicts death, and that sputum Xpert MTB/RIF has suboptimal 
      diagnostic yield for M tuberculosis BSI. METHODS: We did a systematic review and 
      individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of studies performing routine 
      mycobacterial blood culture in a prospectively defined patient population of people 
      with HIV aged 13 years or older. Studies were identified through searching PubMed 
      and Scopus up to Nov 10, 2018, without language or date restrictions and through 
      manual review of reference lists. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed 
      with an adapted QUADAS-2 framework. IPD were requested for all identified studies 
      and subject to harmonised inclusion criteria: age 13 years or older, HIV positivity, 
      available CD4 cell count, a valid mycobacterial blood culture result (excluding 
      patients with missing data from lost or contaminated blood cultures), and meeting 
      WHO definitions for suspected tuberculosis (presence of screening symptom). 
      Predicted probabilities of M tuberculosis BSI from mixed-effects modelling were used 
      to estimate prevalence. Estimates of diagnostic yield of sputum testing with Xpert 
      (or culture if Xpert was unavailable) and of urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing 
      for M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by two-level random-effect meta-analysis. 
      Estimates of mortality associated with M tuberculosis BSI were obtained by 
      mixed-effect Cox proportional-hazard modelling and of effect of treatment delay on 
      mortality by propensity-score analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, 
      number 42016050022. FINDINGS: We identified 23 datasets for inclusion (20 published 
      and three unpublished at time of search) and obtained IPD from 20, representing 
      96·2% of eligible IPD. Risk of bias for the included studies was assessed to be 
      generally low except for on the patient selection domain, which was moderate in most 
      studies. 5751 patients met harmonised IPD-level inclusion criteria. Technical 
      factors such as number of blood cultures done, timing of blood cultures relative to 
      blood sampling, and patient factors such as inpatient setting and CD4 cell count, 
      explained significant heterogeneity between primary studies. The predicted 
      probability of M tuberculosis BSI in hospital inpatients with HIV-associated 
      tuberculosis, WHO danger signs, and a CD4 count of 76 cells per μL (the median for 
      the cohort) was 45% (95% CI 38-52). The diagnostic yield of sputum in patients with 
      M tuberculosis BSI was 77% (95% CI 63-87), increasing to 89% (80-94) when combined 
      with urine LAM testing. Presence of M tuberculosis BSI compared with its absence in 
      patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis increased risk of death before 30 days 
      (adjusted hazard ratio 2·48, 95% CI 2·05-3·08) but not after 30 days (1·25, 
      0·84-2·49). In a propensity-score matched cohort of participants with HIV-associated 
      tuberculosis (n=630), mortality increased in patients with M tuberculosis BSI who 
      had a delay in anti-tuberculosis treatment of longer than 4 days compared with those 
      who had no delay (odds ratio 3·15, 95% CI 1·16-8·84). INTERPRETATION: In critically 
      ill adults with HIV-tuberculosis, M tuberculosis BSI is a frequent manifestation of 
      tuberculosis and predicts mortality within 30 days. Improved diagnostic yield in 
      patients with M tuberculosis BSI could be achieved through combined use of sputum 
      Xpert and urine LAM. Anti-tuberculosis treatment delay might increase the risk of 
      mortality in these patients. FUNDING: This study was supported by Wellcome 
      fellowships 109105Z/15/A and 105165/Z/14/A.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection has been suggested to 
      contribute to the pathogenesis of erythema nodosum (EN) and nodular vasculitis (NV), 
      the classic forms of panniculitis. However, there is little evidence to demonstrate 
      the presence of MTB in the skin lesions. This study is aimed at evaluating the 
      association between MTB infection and the development of EN and NV in a Chinese 
      population. METHODS: A total of 107 patients (36 EN, 27 NV, and 44 others) with 
      vasculitis and 40 control cases with other skin diseases were recruited and their 
      skin lesion samples were subjected to real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      analysis of the IS6110 and mpt64 gene fragments of MTB. Their blood mononuclear 
      cells were tested for MTB antigen-specific IFN-γ responses by QuantiFERON®-TB Gold 
      In-Tube (IT) assays. RESULTS: PCR analysis revealed that 7/23 (30.4%) and 7/18 
      (38.9%) of the EN and NV samples were positive for the IS6110 DNA, respectively, 
      which were significantly higher than 3/34 (8.8%) of other vasculitis (OV) and 3/40 
      (7.5%) of the control samples (p<0.05). The nested Real-Time PCR assay indicated 
      that 6/7 (86%) of the IS6110-positive EN samples, all of the IS6110-positive NV and 
      control samples, but only 1/3 of the IS6110-positive OV samples, were positive for 
      the mpt64 gene. Similarly, 19/32 (59.4%) of the EN patients, 20/26 (76.9%) of the NV 
      patients, and 17/36 (47.2%) of the OV patients were positive for MTB 
      antigen-specific IFN-γ responses, which were significantly higher than 6/40 (15%) of 
      the controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our data strongly suggest that MTB infection and 
      active TB are associated with the development of NV and EN in Chinese.

AB  - We investigated the diagnostic values of microRNA-31 in peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs) for pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis in Chinese patients. Sixty-five 
      children with TB were selected for this study, which was conducted at the Department 
      of Infectious Diseases People's Hospital of Laiwu City between December 2013 and 
      December 2014. Sixty healthy children, selected in parallel, served as the control 
      group. Real-time PCR was used to detect miR-31 expression in PBMCs. Serum levels of 
      IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB, and IFN-γ was detected by ELISA. ROC curve was employed to 
      evaluate the diagnostic value of miR-31 in pediatric TB. Results show that 
      expression of miRNA-31 in pediatric TB patients was significantly lower than that in 
      normal children (0.48 ± 0.15 vs 1.23 ± 0.36, P < 0.05). By contrast, serum levels of 
      the innate immune response cytokines, IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB, and IFN-γ, were 
      significantly higher in pediatric TB patients compared with normal children (P < 
      0.05). Furthermore, miRNA-31 expression was negatively correlated with serum levels 
      of IL-6 (t = 69.91, P < 0.001), TNF-α (t = 10.96, P < 0.001), NF-κB (t = 39.94, P < 
      0.001), and IFN -γ (t = 37.94, P < 0.001). The cut-off threshold of miR-31 for 
      pediatric TB diagnosis is 0.835 with a sensitivity of 98.5% and a specificity of 
      86.7%. Therefore, miR-31 has the potential to be a diagnostic marker in pediatric TB 
      patients.

LID - e38429
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite great efforts to improve diagnosis and treatment, tuberculosis 
      (TB) remains a major health problem worldwide, especially in developing countries. 
      Lack of concrete immune markers is still the obstacle to properly evaluate active 
      TB. Therefore, identification of more validated biomarkers and phenotypic signatures 
      is imperative. In particular, T cell-related biomarkers are more significant. 
      METHODOLOGY: To understand the nature of CD4(+) T cell-derived signatures involved 
      in infection and disease development, we examined and analyzed whole genome 
      expression profiles of purified CD4(+) T cells from healthy individuals (HD), two 
      distinct populations with latent infection (with low or high IFN-γ levels, 
      LTB(L)/LTB(H)) and untreated TB patients. Following, we validated the expression 
      profiles of genes in the peripheral CD4(+) T cells from each group and examined 
      secretion levels of distinct cytokines in serum and pleural effusion. PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: Our bio-informatic analyses indicate that the two latent populations and 
      clinical TB patients possess distinct CD4(+) T cell gene expression profiles. 
      Furthermore, The mRNA and protein expression levels of B cell activating factor 
      (BAFF), which belongs to the TNF family, and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) 
      were markedly up-regulated at the disease stage. In particular, the dramatic 
      enhancement of BAFF and APRIL in the pleural effusion of patients with tuberculosis 
      pleurisy suggests that these proteins may present disease status. In addition, we 
      found that the BAFF/APRIL system was closely related to the Th1 immune response. Our 
      study delineates previously unreported roles of BAFF and APRIL in the development of 
      tuberculosis, and these findings have implications for the diagnosis of the disease. 
      Our study also identifies a number of transcriptional signatures in CD4(+) T cells 
      that have the potential to be utilized as diagnostic and prognostic tools to combat 
      the tuberculosis epidemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Substantial evidence exists for HLA and other host genetic factors being 
      determinants of susceptibility or resistance to infectious diseases. However, very 
      little information is available on the role of host genetic factors in HIV-TB 
      coinfection. Hence, a longitudinal study was undertaken to investigate HLA 
      associations in a cohort of HIV seropositive individuals with and without TB in 
      Bangalore, South India. METHODS: A cohort of 238 HIV seropositive subjects were 
      typed for HLA-A, B, and DR by PCR-SSP and followed up for 5 years or till 
      manifestation of Tuberculosis. HLA data of 682 HIV Negative healthy renal donors was 
      used as control. RESULTS: The ratio of males and females in HIV cohort was 
      comparable (50.4% and 49.6%). But the incidence of TB was markedly lower in females 
      (12.6%,) than males (25.6%). Further, HLA-B*57 frequency in HIV cohort was 
      significantly higher among females without TB (21.6%, 19/88) than males (1.7%, 
      1/59); P = 0.0046; OR = 38. CD4 counts also were higher among females in this 
      cohort. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that HIV positive women with HLA-B*57 have 
      less occurrence of TB as compared to males.

TI  - Prevalence of hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus in a group of 
      patients newly diagnosed with active tuberculosis in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil.
PG  - 255-259

AB  - BACKGROUND: Porto Alegre is the Brazilian state capital with second highest 
      incidence of tuberculosis (TB) and the highest proportion of people infected with 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) among patients with TB. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
      infection increases the risk of anti-TB drug-induced hepatotoxicity, which may 
      result in discontinuation of the therapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was (i) 
      to estimate prevalence of HCV and HIV in a group of patients newly diagnosed with 
      active TB in a public reference hospital in Porto Alegre and (ii) to compare 
      demographic, behavioural, and clinical characteristics of patients in relation to 
      their HCV infection status. METHODS: One hundred and thirty-eight patients with TB 
      were tested for anti-HCV antibody, HCV RNA, and anti-HIV1/2 antibody markers. HCV 
      RNA from real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive samples was submitted to 
      reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The 5' non-coding region of the HCV 
      genome was sequenced, and genotypes of HCV isolates were determined. FINDINGS: 
      Anti-HCV antibody, HCV RNA, and anti-HIV antibodies were detected in 27 [20%; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI), 13-26%], 17 (12%; 95% CI, 7-18%), and 34 (25%; 95% CI, 
      17-32%) patients, respectively. HCV isolates belonged to genotypes 1 (n = 12) and 3 
      (n = 4). Some characteristics were significantly more frequent in patients infected 
      with HCV. Among them, non-white individuals, alcoholics, users of illicit drugs, 
      imprisoned individuals, and those with history of previous TB episode were more 
      commonly infected with HCV (p < 0.05). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: HCV screening, including 
      detection of anti-HCV antibody and HCV RNA, will be important to improving the 
      management of co-infected patients, given their increased risk of developing TB 
      treatment-related hepatotoxicity.

PG  - 378-84
LID - 10.1002/lary.25540 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The whole-blood interferon (IFN)-γ release assay (IGRA) has 
      been studied mainly for diagnosing latent tuberculosis (TB). We prospectively 
      evaluated its diagnostic usefulness in patients with suspected cervical TB 
      lymphadenitis. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: An IGRA was 
      performed in subjects with suspected TB lymphadenitis. To evaluate the diagnostic 
      performance of the IGRA, we calculated the sensitivity and specificity of culture, 
      radiologic imaging, polymerase chain reaction testing, fine needle aspiration, and 
      excisional biopsy. RESULT: Of the 271 adult patients with suspected TB 
      lymphadenitis, 42 were diagnosed with the disease. The overall sensitivity and 
      specificity of the IGRA were 78.8% and 95.5%, respectively. When the cutoff value of 
      IFN-γ was set to 0.26 IU/mL, it met the inclusion criteria for suspicious TB 
      lymphadenitis, with sensitivity and specificity of 83.3% and 95.1%, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The IGRA is useful in diagnosing TB lymphadenitis, with high 
      sensitivity and specificity. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for extrapulmonary tuberculosis specimens: 
      establishing a laboratory testing algorithm for South Africa.
PG  - 1818-23
LID - 10.1128/JCM.03553-13 [doi]
AB  - South Africa implemented Xpert MTB/RIF as the initial diagnostic test for pulmonary 
      tuberculosis (TB). Xpert MTB/RIF's accuracy for diagnosing extrapulmonary 
      tuberculosis (EPTB) was investigated. EPTB specimens (n = 7,916) from hospitalized 
      patients received over a 6-month period at a high-throughput TB referral laboratory 
      in Johannesburg were investigated. Large-volume specimens were centrifuged, tissue 
      biopsy specimens homogenized, and all specimens checked for growth of contaminating 
      bacteria on blood agar. Contaminated samples received NALC-NaOH 
      (N-acetyl-l-cysteine-sodium hydroxide) decontamination prior to liquid culture. 
      Residual specimens (volumes > 1 ml) after inoculation of culture (n = 1,175) were 
      tested using the Xpert MTB/RIF sputum protocol. Using culture as the reference, 
      Xpert MTB/RIF's overall sensitivity was 59% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 53% 
      to 65%) and specificity was 92% (CI, 90% to 94%), with the highest sensitivities of 
      91% (95% CI, 78% to 97%) for pus, 80% (95% CI, 56% to 94%) for lymph node aspirates, 
      and 51% (95% CI, 44% to 58%) for fluids (ascitic, 59%; pleural, 47%). A difference 
      in sensitivities was noticed between specimens classified as having a thick (87% 
      [95% CI, 76% to 94%]) versus clear (watery) (48% [95% CI, 36% to 61%]) appearance. 
      This was unchanged with traces of blood (52% [95% CI, 44% to 60%]) or 
      precentrifugation (57% [95% CI, 28% to 82%]) among clear specimens. Xpert MTB/RIF 
      generated an additional 124 specimen results that were contaminated by Mycobacterial 
      Growth Indicator Tubes (MGIT; 10.5%) and diagnosed rifampin (RIF) resistance earlier 
      (9.6% [25/260]). Xpert MTB/RIF's performance on EPTB specimens provides very 
      promising results and should be considered for incorporation into national TB 
      guidelines. Xpert MTB/RIF is less affected by contaminating bacteria and reduces 
      laboratory labor and diagnostic delay compared to traditional methods.

AB  - Interferon (IFN)-γ release assays have limited sensitivity and cannot differentiate 
      between active tuberculosis (TB) disease and latent TB infection (LTBI). Numerous 
      cytokines and regulator factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis and control 
      of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Additional cytokines and chemokines 
      associated with M. tuberculosis infection may improve the performance of IFN-γ 
      release assays. We developed a real-time RT-PCR TaqMan assay for targeting levels of 
      eight human targets [IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-10, 
      CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and evaluated the assay with three different study 
      groups. Results showed that the sensitivity of TNF-α, IL-2R, and CXCL10 in the 
      active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) group was 96.43%, 96.43%, and 100%, 
      respectively. The sensitivity of IL-2R and CXCL10 in the latent tuberculosis 
      infection group was 86.36% and 81.82%, respectively. Statistical results showed that 
      TNF-α and CXCL9 were the best individual markers for differentiating between the 
      PTB, LTBI, and non-TB groups. For optimal sensitivity and differentiation of M. 
      tuberculosis infection status, the simultaneous detection of multiple targets was 
      attempted. The combination of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2R, and the combination of TNF-α, 
      IL-2R, CXCL9, and CXCL10 showed the best performance for detecting active PTB (both 
      100% positivity) and LTBI (86.36% and 81.82% positivity, respectively). These 
      results imply that the combination of suitable markers is useful in efficiently 
      diagnosing TB and differentiating M. tuberculosis infection status.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Laboratory and clinical features of childhood tuberculosis (TB) are 
      non-specific and establishing an accurate diagnosis remains a challenge. This study 
      evaluated a Single tube nested-PCR (STNPCR) to detect genomic DNA of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis complex in blood and urine. METHODS: Biological samples were obtained 
      from children (<15 years old) with clinical suspicion of pulmonary and 
      extrapulmonary TB at public hospitals in Recife-Pernambuco, Brazil. Cultures yielded 
      negative results in a majority of childhood TB cases, which are generally 
      paucibacillary. A set of clinical, epidemiological, radiological, and laboratory 
      criteria with evident clinical improvement after anti-TB treatment were frequently 
      used to define childhood TB cases. RESULTS: Ninety children with clinical suspicion 
      were enrolled in this study (44 with TB and 46 without TB). The pulmonary TB group 
      had 20 confirmed cases and 46 negative controls, while the extrapulmonary TB group 
      had 24 confirmed cases. The STNPCR showed sensitivities to pulmonary and 
      extrapulmonary TB of 47.4% and 52.2% (blood) and 38.8% and 20% (urine), 
      respectively. Considering the low performance of STNPCR on separate samples, we 
      decided to perform a combined analysis (parallel sensitivity analysis) of the 
      results from blood and urine samples. The parallel sensitivity increased to 65% in 
      blood and 62.5% in urine. The specificity in both samples ranged from 93.5-97.8%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although STNPCR showed moderate sensitivity, the specificity is high; 
      therefore, the test can be used as an auxiliary tool to diagnose TB in children. It 
      is a rapid test that demonstrated better performance than other diagnostic tests in 
      paucibacillary samples as it does in childhood tuberculosis.

LID - 10.1017/S0950268813000265 [doi]
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted from 10 January to 9 April 2012, to determine 
      the seroprevalence of tuberculosis (TB) of all captive Asian elephants and their 
      handlers in six locations in Peninsular Malaysia. In addition, trunk-wash samples 
      were examined for tubercle bacillus by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
      For 63 elephants and 149 elephant handlers, TB seroprevalence was estimated at 20.4% 
      and 24.8%, respectively. From 151 trunkwash samples, 24 acid-fast isolates were 
      obtained, 23 of which were identified by hsp65-based sequencing as non-tuberculous 
      mycobacteria. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific PCR was positive in the 
      trunk-wash samples from three elephants which were also seropositive. Conversely, 
      the trunk wash from seven seropositive elephants were PCR negative. Hence, there was 
      evidence of active and latent TB in the elephants and the high seroprevalence in the 
      elephants and their handlers suggests frequent, close contact, two-way transmission 
      between animals and humans within confined workplaces.

TI  - High prevalence of oxacillinases in clinical multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter 
      baumannii isolates from the Tshwane region, South Africa - an update.
PG  - 521
LID - 10.1186/s12879-015-1246-8 [doi]
LID - 521
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is an important hospital-acquired pathogen in 
      healthcare facilities that frequently causes bacteraemia and ventilator-associated 
      pneumonia in intensive care units. Acinetobacter baumannii can be isolated from 
      various sites in the hospital environment like medical equipment, bed linen, medical 
      personnel and indwelling catheters. It is difficult to treat A. baumannii infections 
      because of their highly resistant antimicrobial profiles. The purpose of this study 
      was to determine the prevalence of β-lactamase genes in multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
      clinical A. baumannii isolates using Multiplex-PCR (M-PCR) assays. METHODS: One 
      hundred MDR A. baumannii isolates were collected from the diagnostic division of the 
      Department of Medical Microbiology after routine analysis of the submitted 
      specimens. All collected isolates were identified and tested for susceptibility 
      using the VITEK 2® system (bioMérieux, France). Six isolates were excluded from this 
      study because the isolates were incorrectly identified as A. baumannii with the 
      VITEK 2® system (bioMérieux, France). Molecular tests, namely M-PCR assays, 
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were 
      performed. MLST analyses were performed on representative isolates from the four 
      major pulsotypes (≥5 isolates with 80 % similarity) and selective isolates from each 
      minor pulsotype. RESULTS: All the A. baumannii isolates showed 100 % resistance to 
      ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, cefuroximine axetil, cefoxitin, cefotaxime and 
      nitrofurantoin. Seven percent of the isolates were resistant to amikacin. Two 
      percent of the isolates were classified as having intermediate susceptibility to 
      tigecycline. A. baumannii isolates showed an antibiotic resistance profile of 67 % 
      and higher to antibiotics, such as ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, 
      gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. None of the isolates 
      were resistant to colistin. The M-PCR assays showed that 99 % of the isolates 
      contained the OXA-51 gene and 77 % contained the OXA-23 gene. None of the isolates 
      contained the GES, GIM, IMP, KPC, NDM, OXA-24, OXA-58, PER, SIM, SPM, VEB and VIM 
      genes. Representative A. baumannii isolates were grouped into five existing sequence 
      types (ST): ST106, ST258, ST339, ST502, ST758 and ST848. Isolates belonging to the 
      pan-European clonal lineages I and II (EUI and EUII) were identified. CONCLUSION: 
      The high prevalence of MDR A. baumannii isolates has a severe impact on available 
      treatment choices and this in return impacts on treatment outcomes in the studied 
      healthcare facilities. The most dominant ST among the collected isolates was ST758, 
      member of the EUI group. The presence of the OXA-23 gene was not restricted to a 
      specific ST. Continuous research and surveillance is necessary to monitor the 
      circulating β-lactamase genes in clinical settings to guide infection control 
      policies in order to try and curb the spread of this bacterium.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autopsy studies of HIV/AIDS-related hospital deaths in sub-Saharan 
      Africa reveal frequent failure of pre-mortem diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), which 
      is found in 34-64 % of adult cadavers. We determined the overall prevalence and 
      predictors of TB among consecutive unselected HIV-positive adults requiring acute 
      hospital admission and the comparative diagnostic yield obtained by screening urine 
      and sputum samples obtained on day 1 of admission with Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert). 
      METHODS: To determine overall TB prevalence accurately, comprehensive clinical 
      sampling (sputum, urine, blood plus other relevant samples) was done and TB was 
      defined by detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in any sample using Xpert and/or 
      mycobacterial liquid culture. To evaluate a rapid screening strategy, we compared 
      the diagnostic yield of Xpert testing sputum samples and urine samples obtained with 
      assistance from a respiratory study nurse in the first 24 h of admission. RESULTS: 
      Unselected HIV-positive acute adult new medical admissions (n = 427) who were not 
      receiving TB treatment were enrolled irrespective of clinical presentation or 
      symptom profile. From 2,391 cultures and Xpert tests done (mean, 5.6 tests/patient) 
      on 1,745 samples (mean, 4.1 samples/patient), TB was diagnosed in 139 patients 
      (median CD4 cell count, 80 cells/μL). TB prevalence was very high (32.6 %; 95 % CI, 
      28.1-37.2 %; 139/427). However, patient symptoms and risk factors were poorly 
      predictive for TB. Overall, ≥1 non-respiratory sample(s) tested positive in 115/139 
      (83 %) of all TB cases, including positive blood cultures in 41/139 (29.5 %) of TB 
      cases. In the first 24 h of admission, sputum (spot and/or induced samples) and 
      urine were obtainable from 37.0 % and 99.5 % of patients, respectively (P <0.001). 
      From these, the proportions of total TB cases (n = 139) that were diagnosed by Xpert 
      testing sputum, urine or both sputum and urine combined within the first 24 h were 
      39/139 (28.1 %), 89/139 (64.0 %) and 108/139 (77.7 %) cases, respectively (P 
      <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The very high prevalence of active TB and its non-specific 
      presentation strongly suggest the need for routine microbiological screening for TB 
      in all HIV-positive medical admissions in high-burden settings. The incremental 
      diagnostic yield from Xpert testing urine was very high and this strategy might be 
      used to rapidly screen new admissions, especially if sputum is difficult to obtain.

AB  - Our understanding of the correlation of Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guerin 
      (BCG)-mediated immune responses and protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      (Mtb) infection is still limited. We have recently characterized a Wistar rat model 
      of experimental tuberculosis (TB). In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy 
      of BCG vaccination in this model. Upon Mtb challenge, BCG vaccinated rats controlled 
      growth of the bacilli earlier than unvaccinated rats. Histopathology analysis of 
      infected lungs demonstrated a reduced number of granulomatous lesions and lower 
      parenchymal inflammation in vaccinated animals. Vaccine-mediated protection 
      correlated with the rapid accumulation of antigen specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells 
      in the infected lungs. Immunohistochemistry further revealed higher number of CD8(+) 
      cells in the pulmonary granulomas of vaccinated animals. Evaluation of pulmonary 
      immune responses in vaccinated and Mtb infected rats by real time PCR at day 15 
      post-challenge showed reduced expression of genes responsible for negative 
      regulation of Th1 immune responses. Thus, early protection observed in BCG 
      vaccinated rats correlated with a similarly timed shift of immunity towards the Th1 
      type response. Our data support the importance of (i) the Th1-Th2 balance in the 
      control of mycobacterial infection and (ii) the value of the Wistar rats in 
      understanding the biology of TB.

TI  - Role of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in rapid diagnosis of tuberculous mycobacteria in 
      different clinical samples.
PG  - 81-4
AB  - The study was aimed for molecular detection of mycobacterial DNA in different 
      clinical samples using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system and rapid 
      diagnosis of tuberculosis. A total of 508 clinical specimens (blood 343, menstrual 
      fluid 53, endometrial tissue 43, body fluid 36, pus from lymph nodes 18, sputum 8, 
      urine 5 and semen 2) were included in this study. We extracted DNA using QIAamp DNA 
      Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and performed real-time assay using Rotor-Gene Q machine 
      from Corbett Research, Australia for specific amplification of IS6110 sequence of 
      mycobacterial genome. The RT-PCR result was also compared with bacterial culture and 
      acid-fast bacillus staining. RT-PCR assay showed positivity in 52 cases and negative 
      in 456 cases. Corresponding positive results in culture and acid-fast bacillus 
      staining methods were 49 cases and 24 cases respectively. The sensitivity and 
      specificity of detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis by RT-PCR were 93.87% and 98.69% 
      respectively taking positive culture results as reference standards. The overall 
      positive and negative predictive values were 88.46% and 99.34% respectively. RT-PCR 
      is a useful diagnostic tool for rapid and sensitive detection of mycobacteria in 
      different clinical samples. The easy processing, fast reporting and relative lack of 
      contamination issues make it worthy as a possible replacement to time consuming 
      culture techniques. Moreover, it has added advantage of quantification of 
      mycobacterial DNA, hence bacterial load.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Molecular analyses are auxiliary tools for detecting Koch's bacilli in 
      clinical specimens from patients with suspected tuberculosis (TB). However, there 
      are still no efficient diagnostic tests that combine high sensitivity and 
      specificity and yield rapid results in the detection of TB. This study evaluated 
      single-tube nested polymerase chain reaction (STNPCR) as a molecular diagnostic test 
      with low risk of cross contamination for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 
      clinical samples. METHODS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
      was detected in blood and urine samples by STNPCR followed by agarose gel 
      electrophoresis. In this system, reaction tubes were not opened between the two 
      stages of PCR (simple and nested). RESULTS: STNPCR demonstrated good accuracy in 
      clinical samples with no cross contamination between microtubes. Sensitivity in 
      blood and urine, analyzed in parallel, was 35%-62% for pulmonary and 41%-72% for 
      extrapulmonary TB. The specificity of STNPCR was 100% in most analyses, depending on 
      the type of clinical sample (blood or urine) and clinical form of disease (pulmonary 
      or extrapulmonary). CONCLUSIONS: STNPCR was effective in detecting TB, especially 
      the extrapulmonary form for which sensitivity was higher, and had the advantage of 
      less invasive sample collection from patients for whom a spontaneous sputum sample 
      was unavailable. With low risk of cross contamination, the STNPCR can be used as an 
      adjunct to conventional methods for diagnosing TB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is still a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge 
      with high proportion of smear- and culture- negative incidences worldwide. The 
      conventional diagnostic tests are time-consuming and have a low sensitivity. Digital 
      PCR is a novel technology which can detect target sequences with relatively low 
      abundance and obtain the absolute copy numbers of the targets. METHODS: We assessed 
      the accuracy of dPCR in TB diagnosis using more than 250 specimens, and for the 
      first time, we selected M.tuberculosis-specific IS1081 in addition to widely used 
      IS6110 as the amplification targets for dPCR. The quantification of target DNA was 
      calculated using QuantaSoft Version 1.7.4.0917 (BioRad), and SPSS version 13.0 
      software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: 
      IS6110-dPCR was more sensitive than IS1081, with the sensitivity and specificity 
      accounting for 40.6 and 93.4% respectively. When we classified the TB patients by 
      personal factors for high copy number of M.tuberculosis derived DNA in plasma: 
      bilateral TB, extrapulmonary TB and disseminated TB, the sensitivity of both IS6110- 
      and IS1081- dPCR was the highest in patients with disseminated TB (IS6110, 100%; 
      IS1081, 68.8%), while their sensitivity was a bit higher in patients with 
      extrapulmonary TB (IS6110, 50.0%; IS1081, 39.3%) than that in bilateral TB (IS6110, 
      43.3%; IS1081, 33.3%). Compared with traditional TB diagnostic tests, joint 
      detection IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR was not as sensitive as smear microscope or 
      mycobacterial culture, but it was higher than IS6110 qPCR (p < 0.05) and was able to 
      detect 47.4% of smear-negative TB patients. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that 
      plasma IS6110-dPCR is a rapid, moderate accurate and less-invasive method to detect 
      M.tuberculosis DNA in plasma of TB patients and IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR has a potential 
      to aid diagnosis of smear-negative TB.

TI  - Blood neutrophil counts in HIV-infected patients with pulmonary tuberculosis: 
      association with sputum mycobacterial load.
PG  - e67956
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0067956 [doi]
LID - e67956
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that neutrophils play a role in the host 
      response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We determined whether neutrophil counts in 
      peripheral blood are associated with tuberculosis (TB) and with mycobacterial load 
      in sputum in HIV-infected patients. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adults enrolling 
      in an antiretroviral treatment (ART) clinic in a Cape Town township were screened 
      for TB regardless of symptoms. Paired sputum samples were examined using liquid 
      culture, fluorescence microscopy, and the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Absolute neutrophil 
      counts (ANC) were measured in blood samples. Of 602 HIV-infected patients screened, 
      523 produced one or more sputum samples and had complete results available for 
      analysis. Among these 523 patients, the median CD4 count was 169×10(9)/L (IQR, 
      96-232) and median ANC was 2.6×10(9)/L (IQR, 1.9-3.6). Culture-positive pulmonary 
      tuberculosis was diagnosed in 89 patients. Patients with TB had a median ANC of 
      3.4×10(9)/L (IQR, 2.4-5.1) compared to 2.5×10(9)/L (IQR, 1.8-3.4) among those who 
      were culture negative (p<0.0001). In multivariable analyses, having pulmonary TB was 
      associated with an adjusted risk ratio (aRR) of 2.6 (95%CI, 1.5-4.5) for having an 
      ANC level that exceeded the median value (ANC ≥2.6×10(9)/L; p = 0.0006) and an aRR 
      of 6.8 (95%CI, 2.3-20.4) for having neutrophilia defined by a neutrophil count 
      exceeding the upper limit of the normal range (ANC >7.5×10(9)/L; p = 0.0005). 
      Patients were then classified into four mutually exclusive groups with increasing 
      sputum mycobacterial load as defined by the results of culture, Xpert MTB/RIF and 
      sputum smear microscopy. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that increasing sputum 
      mycobacterial load was positively associated with blood ANC ≥2.6×10(9)/L and with 
      neutrophilia. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Increased blood neutrophil counts were 
      independently associated with pulmonary TB and sputum mycobacterial burden in this 
      HIV-infected patient group. This observation supports the growing body of literature 
      regarding the potential role for neutrophils in the host response to TB.

TI  - B-cells with a FasL expressing regulatory phenotype are induced following successful 
      anti-tuberculosis treatment.
PG  - 57-67
LID - 10.1002/iid3.140 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Studies show that B-cells, in addition to producing antibodies and 
      antigen-presentation, are able to produce cytokines as well. These include 
      regulatory cytokines such as IL-10 by regulatory B-cells. Furthermore, a rare 
      regulatory subset of B-cells have the potential to express FasL, which is a 
      death-inducing ligand. This subset of B-cells have a positive role during autoimmune 
      disease, but has not yet been studied during tuberculosis. These FasL-expressing 
      B-cells are induced by bacterial LPS and CpG, thus we hypothesized that this 
      phenotype might be induced during tuberculosis as well. METHODS: B-cells from 
      participants with TB (at diagnosis and during treatment) and controls were 
      collected, and analyzed by means of real-time PCR and flow cytometry. In addition to 
      this, BAL was collected from TB participants as well and analyzed by means of MAGPix 
      (multi-cytokine) technology. RESULTS: Gene expression analysis show that FASL 
      transcript levels increase by the end of treatment. Similarly, phenotypic analysis 
      show that there is a higher frequency of FasL-expressing B-cells by the end of 
      treatment. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results indicate that these 
      FasL-expressing B-cells are being induced during anti-TB treatment, and thus may 
      play a positive role. Further studies are required to elucidate this.

TI  - Blood and urine samples as useful sources for the direct detection of tuberculosis 
      by polymerase chain reaction.
PG  - 141-6
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the utility of the polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) assay in blood and urine for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). We 
      prospectively evaluated the usefulness of PCR performed in blood and urine samples 
      from patients with proved or probable TB compared with a control group of patients. 
      The PCR technique was performed using IS6110 primers. We included in the study 57 
      patients (43 with definite TB and 14 with probable TB) and 26 controls. Blood and 
      urine samples were drawn at the time of microbiologic diagnosis and 3, 6, 9, and 12 
      months later. Cultures were positive in the early period (<1 month after treatment) 
      in 11 of 57 patients (19%) with probable or definite TB, in comparison with 42% of 
      patients (24/57) who yielded a positive PCR (P = 0.02). Urine samples increased the 
      sensitivity of PCR determination in blood samples by 10%. The PCR in blood and/or 
      urine was positive in 41% of patients with pulmonary TB, in 36% of patients with 
      extrapulmonary TB, and in 50% of patients with disseminated TB. Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis was still detectable by PCR in 5 of 13 patients with cured TB after 1 
      or more months of antituberculous treatment. The PCR detection of M. tuberculosis in 
      blood and urine samples is useful for the diagnosis of different clinical forms of 
      TB, mostly in those patients in which sample extraction is difficult or requires 
      aggressive techniques. The sensitivity of this technique could be improved studying 
      more than 1 sample in each patient, even after initiating an antituberculous 
      treatment.

AB  - The paleopathological analysis of a well-preserved young adult female skeleton from 
      the AD 7-8th century (Avar Age) in Hungary revealed multiple lytic lesions in all of 
      the thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies. The lesions were characterized by smooth 
      marginal zones and space-occupying mass appearance. The considerable loss of spongy 
      bone in the thoracolumbar vertebrae resulted in angular deformity and fusion, 
      characteristic of the healing stage of TB. Osteolytic lesions were also observed on 
      the vertebral processes, ribs and sternum. On the endocranial surface, abnormal 
      blood vessel impressions were revealed, indicating some kind of meningitis. The 
      X-ray and CT analysis of the affected bones detected abnormal structures and cystic 
      zones of destruction. The lesions were however not always bordered by areas of 
      increased density, which is typical in cystic TB. Vertebral remains were also 
      subjected to biomolecular analysis in two different laboratories, which attested the 
      presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) DNA and supported the 
      paleopathological diagnosis of TB. Spoligotyping analysis confirmed the presence of 
      MTBC DNA and more specifically an infection caused by bacteria belonging to the M. 
      tuberculosis lineage. This case study provides new data for the paleoepidemiology of 
      TB in this geographical area and historical period, and draws attention to the great 
      variability of TB lesions in the human skeleton.

TI  - Predictive value of anemia for tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients in Sub-Saharan 
      Africa: an indication for routine microbiological investigation using new rapid 
      assays.
PG  - 33-40
LID - 10.1097/QAI.0000000000000091 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between anemia and undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) in 
      patients living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa is incompletely defined. We assessed 
      the prevalence of TB among those with HIV-related anemia and evaluated new means of 
      rapid TB diagnosis. METHODS: Blood hemoglobin levels were measured in unselected 
      antiretroviral treatment-naive patients in Cape Town, South Africa, and anemia was 
      classified according to World Health Organization criteria. All patients were 
      screened for TB by testing paired sputum samples using liquid culture (reference 
      standard), fluorescence microscopy, and Xpert MTB/RIF. Urine samples were tested for 
      lipoarabinomannan (LAM) using the Determine TB-LAM diagnostic assay. RESULTS: Of 602 
      adults screened, 485 had complete results. Normal hemoglobin levels were found in 
      44.5% (n = 216) of patients, and mild, moderate, or severe anemia were present in 
      24.9% (n = 121), 25.4% (n = 123) and 5.2% (n = 25) of patients, respectively. 
      Culture-confirmed pulmonary TB was diagnosed in 8.8% (19/216) of those without 
      anemia compared with 16.5% (20/121), 26.0% (32/123), and 40.0% (10/25) among those 
      with mild, moderate, or severe anemia, respectively (P < 0.001). Anemia was a strong 
      independent predictor of TB. The sensitivities of diagnostic assays were much higher 
      among those with moderate/severe anemia compared with those with no/mild anemia 
      using sputum microscopy (42.9% vs 15.4%), urine LAM (54.8% vs 0%), sputum microscopy 
      plus urine LAM (71.4% vs 15.4%), and sputum Xpert (73.8% vs 41.0%) (P < 0.01 for 
      all). CONCLUSIONS: A very high prevalence of undiagnosed TB was found in patients 
      with moderate or severe anemia. Such patients should be prioritized for routine 
      microbiological investigation using rapid diagnostic assays.

TI  - Concordant or discordant results by the tuberculin skin test and the quantiFERON-TB 
      test in children reflect immune biomarker profiles.
PG  - 265-74
LID - 10.1038/gene.2014.13 [doi]
AB  - The tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON-TB-Gold-In-tube (QFTGIT) are 
      adjunctive tests used in the diagnosis of pediatric tuberculosis (TB). Neither test 
      can rule out TB; however, a positive test usually triggers preventive treatment in 
      TB contacts aged <5 years. TST and QFTGIT can give divergent results and it is 
      unclear how discordant results should be interpreted in terms of TB risk and 
      preventive treatment. To understand the immune processes underlying concordant or 
      discordant TST and QFTGIT results, we analyzed immune responses in children from 
      Palamaner Taluk in India (a TB-endemic region with routine neonatal BCG vaccination) 
      who were referred to a TB case verification ward on suspicion of TB. Two hundred and 
      ten children aged <3 years were classified according to their TST and QFTGIT 
      results, and their immune responses analyzed by 
      dual-colour-Reverse-Transcriptase-Multiple-Ligation-dependent-Probe-Amplification, 
      using a panel of 45 genes and a 10-plex antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay. We show that immune biomarkers FPR1, TNFRSF1A and interferon (IFN)-γ are 
      upregulated (all P<0.05) in concordant test-positive children, whereas BPI is 
      downregulated (P<0.05). In contrast, SEC14L1 (P=0.034) and Interferon gamma-induced 
      protein 10 (IP-10) (P=0.001) are differentially expressed between the TST+QFTGIT- 
      /TST-QFTGIT+ groups. Known TB exposure was more frequent in concordant positive 
      children and results were consistent with elevated expression of genes associated 
      with inflammatory responses. Children with discordant test results displayed a mixed 
      profile with activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory markers. TST and/or 
      QFTGIT positivity appears to reflect distinct but overlapping aspects of host 
      immunity.

TI  - The etiologic diagnosis of infectious discitis is improved by amplification-based 
      DNA analysis.
PG  - 2985-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blood cultures and cultures of disc material are required to identify and 
      treat bacterial agents responsible for septic spondylodiscitis, but these methods 
      have limited sensitivities. We undertook this study to compare nonculture 
      amplification-based DNA analysis with conventional culture of disc aspirate. 
      METHODS: Nineteen patients with spondylodiscitis, including 11 with a history of 
      spinal surgery, presented with negative blood cultures and underwent percutaneous 
      disc or epidural abscess puncture for bacterial diagnosis. Amplification by 
      polymerase chain reaction was performed on 16S ribosomal DNA universal target genes 
      and femA staphylococci-specific target genes in all patients, and on the upstream 
      p34 mycobacterial gene in 1 patient. Species identification relied on amplicon 
      sequencing and comparison with templates from GenBank. Amplification of the femA 
      gene led to subsequent testing for methicillin resistance by amplification of the 
      mecA gene. Further assessment using a staphylococci- and methicillin 
      resistance-specific DNA array was performed on 3 samples. RESULTS: Microbiologic and 
      molecular assays identified the causative organism in 14 of 19 patients (74%) and 19 
      of 19 patients (100%), respectively. In culture-positive patients, DNA-based and 
      microbiologic results were highly correlated. Five agents (Staphylococcus simulans, 
      Staphylococcus sciuri, Brucella species, Actinomyces israelii, and Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis complex) were identified only by DNA-based methods. In 1 sample, 
      Corynebacterium jeikeium and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were both cultured, 
      whereas DNA analysis identified only Staphylococcus hominis. CONCLUSION: DNA-based 
      methods are highly sensitive and specific. They can usefully complement standard 
      microbiologic methods for identifying the cause of infectious spondylodiscitis and 
      contribute to species-specific therapeutic orientation in patients with negative 
      blood and disc aspirate cultures.

TI  - [Th2 differentiation features of Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat resistant 
      antigen-activated human γδT cells and the regulation of transcription factor 
      T-bet/GATA-3 on differentiation].
PG  - 72-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate Th2 differentiation features of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      heat resistant antigens (MTB-HAg)-activated human γδT cells and the regulation of 
      transcription factor T-box expression in T cells (T-bet) and GATA-binding protein 3 
      (GATA-3) on differentiation. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
      were stimulated with MTB-HAg to generate MTB-HAg-activated T cells (MTBAT) and 
      expanded in the neutral condition or Th2 polarizing condition. After restimulation 
      for 6 hours with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 10 ng/mL), ionomycin (500 ng/mL) 
      and monensin (2.5 μmol/L), intracellular cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-4) of γδT cells and 
      αβT cells among MTBAT were detected by four-color fluorescence mAb staining combined 
      with flow cytometry. The highly purified γδT cells and CD4⁺ T cells were sorted by 
      flow cytometer from MTBAT that were cultured in neutral and Th2 polarizing 
      conditions for 28 days. The expressions of T-bet and GATA-3 mRNA in purified γδT 
      cells and CD4⁺ T cells were determined by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) 
      technique. RESULTS: γδT cells among MTBAT cultured in the neutral or Th2 polarizing 
      condition predominantly produced IFN-γ, whereas the percentage of IFN-γ⁺ αβT cells 
      significantly decreased in the Th2 polarizing condition as the culture time went by. 
      Compared with the neutral condition, Th0 type (IFN-γ⁺ IL-4⁺) γδT cells significantly 
      increased, and Th2 type (IFN-γ⁻ IL-4⁺) αβT cells also significantly increased in the 
      Th2 polarizing condition. RT-PCR showed that mRNA expression of T-bet was still at a 
      high level in γδT cells that were expanded in the Th2 polarizing condition, but at a 
      low level in Th2 polarized CD4⁺ T cells. Moreover, the mRNA expressions of GATA-3 in 
      both Th2 polarized γδT cells and CD4⁺T cells were up-regulated. CONCLUSION: In the 
      Th2 polarizing condition, the majority of γδT cells in MTBAT still remained Th1 
      profile, whereas the portion of γδT cells differentiated into Th0 type cells. Both 
      transcription factor T-bet and GATA-3 failed to display a fully cross-regulation 
      function in Th2 polarized γδT cells.

AB  - Identification of blood biomarkers that can be useful for predicting Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (M.TB) infection, effect of therapy and Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) TB 
      infected individuals is clinically useful for combating tuberculosis epidemic. In 
      this study, we have evaluated the levels of selected miRNAs in serum of TB and MDR 
      TB patients. In addition, we have studied their levels in serum of patients 
      post-therapy. The levels of 4-miRNAs (miR-16, miR-29a, miR-125b and miR-155) were 
      measured in 30 newly diagnosed TB patients, 19 Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) TB 
      patients, 10 patients who completed TB therapy and were TB negative. 30 healthy 
      individuals were recruited as controls. The levels of the miRNAs were estimated by 
      qRT-PCR. Of the four miRNAs studied, the levels of miR-16 were significantly 
      elevated and miR-155 were significantly reduced in serum of TB patients as compared 
      to uninfected controls. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of miR-16 
      and miR-155 exhibited a significant distinguishing efficiency with an AUC value of 1 
      (95% CI, 1 to 1) and 0.967 (95% CI, 0.92-1.04) respectively. Following the therapy, 
      the levels of miR-16 and miR-155 returned to those observed in healthy subjects. In 
      patients with MDR TB, miR-155 was lower as compared to healthy controls and TB 
      treated group but higher as compared to TB naïve patients. miR-16 levels were lowest 
      in serum of MDR TB patients compared to TB naïve, TB treated group and healthy 
      controls. In conclusion, miR-16 and miR-155 in serum may act as surrogate biomarker 
      for studying TB infection, progression of therapy and MDR TB.

TI  - Value of bone marrow biopsy in children with suspected disseminated mycobacterial 
      disease.
PG  - 200-4, i
AB  - BACKGROUND: Disseminated tuberculosis (TB) is a severe form of disease that can be 
      difficult to diagnose or exclude. The diagnostic role of bone marrow biopsy and 
      culture in children with suspected disseminated TB is not clearly defined. 
      METHODOLOGY: In a prospective hospital-based study conducted from November 2007 to 
      October 2008, bone marrow biopsy and culture were performed in all children referred 
      with possible disseminated TB; relevant clinical and laboratory data were reviewed. 
      RESULTS: Thirty-five children were included in the study. An alternative diagnosis 
      was established in 10 (29%) and mycobacterial disease confirmed or probable in 25 
      (71%). Among those with mycobacterial disease, multiple respiratory specimens 
      provided the best yield (17/25; 68%). Bone marrow histology and/or culture were 
      positive in 5/25 (20%), but were frequently collected after initiation of TB 
      treatment. Blood cultures were positive in only one patient. Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis accounted for 16/19 (84%) confirmed cases, M.bovis bacille 
      Calmette-Guérin for one, M. avium complex for one, and one was culture-negative. 
      Histology results were available within 24 hours; TB was confirmed exclusively by 
      bone marrow in two cases. CONCLUSION: Bone marrow biopsy is a valuable diagnostic 
      procedure in children with suspected disseminated mycobacterial disease. Ideally, 
      patients should be referred prior to treatment initiation.

AB  - Tuberculous pericarditis develops either via hematogenous or lymphangeal spread, or 
      directly from pulmonary lesions. Tuberculous pericarditis begins with fibrin 
      deposits, granuloma formation, and the presence of live acid-fast bacilli. A 
      pericardial effusion, which is serous but often contains some blood with a high 
      level of protein. Recently, PCR technology has been employed to amplify M. 
      Tuberculosis DNA from pericardial fluid. The elevation of ADA (> 45 U/l) is 
      supportive of the diagnosis. Tuberculous pericarditis is detected clinically either 
      in the effusive stage by nonspecific systemic syndrome or after the development of 
      constrictive pericarditis. The short-course treatment of tuberculous pericarditis 
      should consist of three-drug regimen, such as INH, RFP, PZA, SM, EB. The use of 
      prednisolone is controversial. Tuberculous myocarditis is extremely rare because of 
      low affinity between M. Tuberculosis and myocardium. Most cases of tuberculous 
      pericarditis are clinically silent and diagnosed at autopsy.

AB  - In this study, we found that a subpopulation of CD4(+)CD25(+) (85% Foxp3(+)) cells 
      from persons with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) inhibits growth of M. 
      tuberculosis (M. tb) in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). A soluble factor, 
      Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (D4GDI), produced by apoptotic CD4(+)CD25(+) (85% 
      Foxp3(+)) cells is responsible for this inhibition of M. tb growth in human 
      macrophages and in mice. M. tb-expanded CD4(+C)D25(+)Foxp3(+)D4GDI(+) cells do not 
      produce IL-10, TGF-β and IFN-γ. D4GDI inhibited growth of M. tb in MDMs by enhancing 
      production of IL-1β, TNF-α and ROS, and by increasing apoptosis of M. tb-infected 
      MDMs. D4GDI was concentrated at the site of disease in tuberculosis patients, with 
      higher levels detected in pleural fluid than in serum. However, in response to M. 
      tb, PBMC from tuberculosis patients produced less D4GDI than PBMC from persons with 
      LTBI. M. tb-expanded CD4+CD25+ (85% Foxp3(+)) cells and D4GDI induced intracellular 
      M. tb to express the dormancy survival regulator DosR and DosR-dependent genes, 
      suggesting that D4GDI induces a non-replicating state in the pathogen. Our study 
      provides the first evidence that a subpopulation of CD4(+)CD25(+) (85% Foxp3+) cells 
      enhances immunity to M. tb, and that production of D4GDI by this subpopulation 
      inhibits M. tb growth.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Currently only limited data exist regarding the availability and 
      clinical use of molecular and immunological tests for tuberculosis (TB) in the 
      European setting. METHODS: Web-based survey of 
      Paediatric-Tuberculosis-Network-European-Trialsgroup (ptbnet) and 
      Tuberculosis-Network-European-Trialsgroup (TBnet) members conducted June to December 
      2013. Both networks comprise clinicians, microbiologists, epidemiologists and 
      researchers predominately based in Europe. RESULTS: 191 healthcare professionals 
      from 31 European countries participated. Overall, 26.8% of respondents did not have 
      access to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay; only 44.6% had access to the assay in-house. 
      However, a substantial proportion had access to other commercial and/or 
      non-commercial PCR-based assays for TB (68.8% and 31.8%, respectively). Only 6.4% 
      did not have access to any PCR-based assays for TB. A large proportion of 
      participants with access to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay had used it for the analysis of 
      non-respiratory samples [pleural fluid: 36.5%, gastric aspirates: 34.7%, 
      cerebrospinal fluid: 34.7%, stool samples: 4.3%, blood/serum: 2.6%, 'other samples' 
      (which included biopsy/tissue samples, lymph node aspirates, joint aspirates and 
      urine samples): 16.5%]. Regarding interferon-gamma release assays, a greater 
      proportion of respondents had access to the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay (84.7%) than 
      to the T-SPOT.TB assay (52.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Both immunological and molecular TB 
      tests are widely available across Europe. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay is more 
      widely used than the T-SPOT.TB assay, which may reflect the difficulties of 
      integrating an ELISPOT assay into the routine laboratory setting. Although Xpert 
      MTB/RIF assays are optimised and solely licensed for the analysis of sputum samples, 
      in clinical practice they are commonly used for non-respiratory samples. Further 
      research is needed to establish how current molecular TB tests impact on patient 
      care and outcome in the routine clinical setting.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study evaluated the performance of an in-house nested-PCR system 
      for the detection of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in pleural fluid, blood 
      and urine samples from pleural effusion tuberculosis patients by health services 
      physicians in Pernambuco, Brazil. METHODS: A prospective double-blind study with 37 
      hospitalized patients of both sexes, aged over 15, was used to investigate the 
      diagnosis of pleural effusion. The criteria used to define the cases included the 
      demonstration of bacillus in biological samples by smear or culture or by a 
      granulomatous finding in the histopathological examination, associated with an 
      evident response to specific treatments to each clinical situation. Pleural fluid, 
      blood and urine samples were collected and subjected to routine tests and the nested 
      PCR technique to assess for M. tuberculosis amplification. RESULTS: In total, 37 
      pleural effusion patients took part in the study, of whom 19 (51.3%) had tubercular 
      etiologies and 18 (48.7%) had etiologies from other causes. When the pleural fluid, 
      blood and/or urine sample in-house nested-PCR sensitivities were evaluated 
      simultaneously, the results were positive regardless of the biological specimen (the 
      sensitivity was 84.2%); however, when the blood and/or urine samples were analyzed 
      together, the sensitivity was 72.2%. When the pleural fluid samples were evaluated 
      alone, the sensitivity was only 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the 
      diagnostic pleural tuberculosis nested-PCR was directly related to the diversity of 
      the samples collected from the same patient. Additionally, this study may identify a 
      need to prioritize non-invasive blood and urine collection for this diagnosis.

AB  - The non-specific clinical findings and variable histopathological features of 
      cutaneous tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections often make it 
      difficult to establish a diagnosis and initiate appropriate therapy. We investigated 
      25 patients diagnosed with mycobacterial infections of the skin in Hanyang 
      University Hospital between 2001 and 2011. Skin biopsy specimens were re-evaluated 
      by various histopathological criteria and molecular studies. To identify the 
      mycobacteria, we performed staining for acid-fast bacilli and also completed 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis. The non-tuberculous mycobacterium species were 
      identified by genetic sequencing of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. 
      Immunocompromised status was more frequent in non-tuberculous mycobacterial 
      infections than in tuberculosis (p = 0.017) while disease duration was longer in 
      tuberculosis (p = 0.026). Microscopically, neutrophil infiltration, interstitial 
      granuloma, small vessel proliferation and increased numbers of bacilli were found to 
      be associated with non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections (all p < 0.05). In 
      contrast, giant cells, plasma cells, tuberculoid granulomas and necrosis were 
      associated with tuberculosis (all p < 0.05). There were no species-specific 
      histopathological findings in non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections. The 
      significant histopathological differences between cutaneous tuberculous and 
      non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections are helpful in considering differential 
      diagnoses. In addition, molecular techniques together with clinico-pathological 
      findings may assist in making accurate diagnoses of cutaneous non-tuberculous 
      mycobacterial infections.

TI  - PCR and Elisa methods (IgG and IgM): their comparison with conventional techniques 
      for diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PG  - 373-7
AB  - In order to establish a rapid and stable method for diagnosis of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis infection and minimize the side effects of delayed diagnosis on 
      patients and health system, a cross sectional study was carried out. Since, the 
      infection rate with this bacteria increasing and one of the reasons for this 
      increase is long process of laboratory identification, therefore establishing new 
      diagnosis methods could decrease disease rate. To achieve this aim, collected sputum 
      and blood specimens from 50 patients with clinical suspicion of pulmonary 
      tuberculosis were studied with both traditional, acid-fast stain (AFB) and culture 
      method compare to Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) (IgG and IgM) and 
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods. The sensitivity and specificity of all 
      methods were determined by using the PCR results as the gold standard. The overall 
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 
      AFB were 17.64, 100, 100 and 70.12%. These values for culture method was 29.41, 100, 
      100 and 73.33% and for IgG antibody were 66.7, 81.81, 64.7 and 81.81% and IgM 
      antibody were 70.58, 90.9, 80 and 85.71%, respectively. It was concluded that 
      maximum sensitivity and specificity can be achieved by PCR method.

TI  - PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 Gene Expression on T-Cells and Natural Killer Cells Declines 
      in Conjunction with a Reduction in PD-1 Protein during the Intensive Phase of 
      Tuberculosis Treatment.
PG  - e0137646
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0137646 [doi]
LID - e0137646
AB  - BACKGROUND: The PD-1 axis is a cell intrinsic immunoregulatory pathway that mediates 
      T cell exhaustion in chronic infection particularly in some viral infections. We 
      hypothesized that PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 would be highly expressed in untreated 
      tuberculosis patients compared to controls due to their chronic infection and would 
      decrease with successful TB treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Untreated tuberculosis 
      patients (n = 26) were recruited at diagnosis and followed up during treatment. 
      Household contacts (n = 24) were recruited to establish baseline differences. Blood 
      gene expression ex vivo was investigated using qRT-PCR. Flow cytometry was performed 
      to establish protein expression patterns. RESULTS: PD-L1 gene expression was found 
      to be elevated in active TB disease; however, this was not observed for PD-1 or 
      PD-L2. The intensive phase of TB treatment was associated with a significant decline 
      in PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 gene expression. PD-1 protein expression on the surface of 
      NK cells, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was similar in patients with active TB disease 
      compared to controls but declined with successful TB treatment, with the greatest 
      decline occurring on the NK cells followed by CD8+ T cells and then CD4+ T cells. 
      Granzyme B/PD-1 co-expression declined with successful intensive phase treatment. 
      CONCLUSION: Modulation of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway through TB treatment indicates changes 
      in the peripheral T cell response caused by live Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) 
      followed by the response to dead bacilli, antigen-release and immuno-pathology 
      resolution. The PD-1 axis could be a host drug target for immunomodulatory 
      treatments in the future.

TI  - Evaluation of Xpert MTB/RIF for detection of tuberculosis from blood samples of 
      HIV-infected adults confirms Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteremia as an indicator 
      of poor prognosis.
PG  - 2311-6
LID - 10.1128/JCM.00330-13 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading cause of death among HIV-infected adults, in 
      part because of delayed diagnosis and therefore delayed initiation of treatment. 
      Recently, the Gene-Xpert platform, a rapid, PCR-based diagnostic platform, has been 
      validated for the diagnosis of TB with sputum. We have evaluated the Xpert MTB/RIF 
      assay for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteremia and investigated 
      its impact on clinical outcomes. Consecutive HIV-infected adults with fever and 
      cough presenting to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, were 
      recruited and followed up for 2 months. At presentation, three sputum samples were 
      examined by smear, culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the presence of M. 
      tuberculosis and blood was drawn for PCR with Xpert, for mycobacterial culture 
      (Myco/F Lytic), and for aerobic culture. One hundred four patients were recruited, 
      and 44 (43%) were sputum culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Ten were Xpert blood 
      positive, for a sensitivity of 21% and a specificity of 100%. The 2-week mortality 
      rate was significantly higher among patients who were Xpert blood positive than 
      among those who were negative (40% versus 3%; multivariate odds ratio [OR] for death 
      if positive, 44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3 to 662). This effect persisted on 
      assessment of the mortality rate at 2 months (40% versus 11%; OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.3 
      to 24.6). When screening uncomplicated patients presenting with a productive cough 
      for pulmonary TB, Xpert blood offers no diagnostic advantage over sputum testing. 
      Despite this, Xpert blood positivity is highly predictive of early death and this 
      test rapidly identifies a group of patients in urgent need of initiation of 
      treatment.

TI  - Suppression of the NF-κB pathway by diesel exhaust particles impairs human 
      antimycobacterial immunity.
PG  - 2778-93
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1101380 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiological studies suggest that chronic exposure to air pollution increases 
      susceptibility to respiratory infections, including tuberculosis in humans. A 
      possible link between particulate air pollutant exposure and antimycobacterial 
      immunity has not been explored in human primary immune cells. We hypothesized that 
      exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP), a major component of urban fine 
      particulate matter, suppresses antimycobacterial human immune effector cell 
      functions by modulating TLR-signaling pathways and NF-κB activation. We show that 
      DEP and H37Ra, an avirulent laboratory strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, were 
      both taken up by the same peripheral human blood monocytes. To examine the effects 
      of DEP on M. tuberculosis-induced production of cytokines, PBMC were stimulated with 
      DEP and M. tuberculosis or purified protein derivative. The production of M. 
      tuberculosis and purified protein derivative-induced IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 
      was reduced in a DEP dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the production of 
      anti-inflammatory IL-10 remained unchanged. Furthermore, DEP stimulation prior to M. 
      tuberculosis infection altered the expression of TLR3, -4, -7, and -10 mRNAs and of 
      a subset of M. tuberculosis-induced host genes including inhibition of expression of 
      many NF-κB (e.g., CSF3, IFNG, IFNA, IFNB, IL1A, IL6, and NFKBIA) and IFN regulatory 
      factor (e.g., IFNG, IFNA1, IFNB1, and CXCL10) pathway target genes. We propose that 
      DEP downregulate M. tuberculosis-induced host gene expression via MyD88-dependent 
      (IL6, IL1A, and PTGS2) as well as MyD88-independent (IFNA, IFNB) pathways. 
      Prestimulation of PBMC with DEP suppressed the expression of proinflammatory 
      mediators upon M. tuberculosis infection, inducing a hyporesponsive cellular state. 
      Therefore, DEP alters crucial components of antimycobacterial host immune responses, 
      providing a possible mechanism by which air pollutants alter antimicrobial immunity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterial infections remain a significant cause of morbidity and 
      mortality worldwide. Due to limitations of the currently available model systems, 
      there are still comparably large gaps in the knowledge about the pathogenesis of 
      these chronic inflammatory diseases in particular with regard to the human host. 
      Therefore, we aimed to characterize the initial phase of mycobacterial infections 
      utilizing a human ex vivo lung tissue culture model designated STST (Short-Term 
      Stimulation of Tissues). METHODS: Human lung tissues from 65 donors with a size of 
      0.5-1 cm(3) were infected each with two strains of three different mycobacterial 
      species (M. tuberculosis, M. avium, and M. abscessus), respectively. In order to 
      preserve both morphology and nucleic acids, the HOPE® fixation technique was used. 
      The infected tissues were analyzed using histo- and molecular-pathological methods. 
      Immunohistochemistry was applied to identify the infected cell types. RESULTS: 
      Morphologic comparisons between ex vivo incubated and non-incubated lung specimens 
      revealed no noticeable differences. Viability of ex vivo stimulated tissues 
      demonstrated by TUNEL-assay was acceptable. Serial sections verified sufficient 
      diffusion of the infectious agents deep into the tissues. Infection was confirmed by 
      Ziel Neelsen-staining and PCR to detect mycobacterial DNA. We observed the infection 
      of different cell types, including macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and 
      pneumocytes-II, which were critically dependent on the mycobacterial species used. 
      Furthermore, different forms of nuclear alterations (karyopyknosis, karyorrhexis, 
      karyolysis) resulting in cell death were detected in the infected cells, again with 
      characteristic species-dependent differences. CONCLUSION: We show the application of 
      a human ex vivo tissue culture model for mycobacterial infections. The immediate 
      primary infection of a set of different cell types and the characteristic 
      morphologic changes observed in these infected human tissues significantly adds to 
      the current understanding of the initial phase of human pulmonary tuberculosis. 
      Further studies are ongoing to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the 
      early onset of mycobacterial infections in the human lung.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is critical for 
      TB control, and difficult in patients with smear-negative sputum. OBJECTIVE: We 
      wanted to evaluate the usefulness of clinical findings, high-resolution computed 
      tomography (HRCT), interferon-gamma-releasing assay (IGRA) and polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) of sputum in the diagnosis of smear-negative PTB. METHODS: From June 
      2006 to September 2008, 178 patients with suspected PTB on the basis of clinical and 
      radiological findings visited our institute. After excluding smear-positive cases (n 
      = 77) and cases with an inconclusive diagnosis (n = 17), we studied 84 patients. 
      Their clinical records, HRCT, sputum TB-PCR assay and IGRA results were 
      retrospectively evaluated. A QuantiFeron-TB Gold (QFT-G; Cellestis Ltd., Carnegie, 
      Vic., Australia) assay was used for the IGRA. RESULTS: Active PTB was diagnosed in 
      40 (48%) of 84 patients; lack of sputum and young age were significantly associated 
      with an increased risk of PTB. The sensitivities of sputum PCR assay, IGRA, and HRCT 
      were 43.2, 84.4 and 80.0%, respectively, and the specificities were 97.7, 82.9 and 
      70.5%, respectively. Among the 38 patients suspected of having PTB based on HRCT, 24 
      patients showed positive results on the IGRA, and 23 of these were diagnosed with 
      active PTB. Among the 35 patients suggested not to have TB based on HRCT, 25 showed 
      negative results on the IGRA, and 23 (92%) of these were diagnosed as not to have 
      TB. CONCLUSION: The combined results of HRCT and the IGRA could help decision-making 
      for early initiation of treatment in smear-negative patients.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that thymosin β4 (Tβ4) stimulates angiogenesis by inducing 
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and stabilizing hypoxia 
      inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein. Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), a type of 
      granulomatous disease, is accompanied by intense angiogenesis and VEGF levels have 
      been reported to be elevated in serum or tissue inflamed by pulmonary tuberculosis. 
      We investigated the expression of Tβ4 in granulomatous lung tissues at various 
      stages of active pulmonary tuberculosis, and we also examined the expression 
      patterns of VEGF and HIF-1α to compare their Tβ4 expression patterns in patients' 
      tissues and in the tissue microarray of TB patients. Tβ4 was highly expressed in 
      both granulomas and surrounding lymphocytes in nascent granulomatous lung tissue, 
      but was expressed only surrounding tissues of necrotic or caseous necrotic regions. 
      The expression pattern of HIF-1α was similar to that of Tβ4. VEGF was expressed in 
      both granulomas and blood vessels surrounding granulomas. The expression pattern of 
      VEGF co-localized with CD31 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, PECAM-1), 
      a blood endothelial cell marker, and partially co-localized with Tβ4. However, the 
      expression of Tβ4 did not co-localize with alveolar macrophages. Stained alveolar 
      macrophages were present surrounding regions of granuloma highly expressing Tβ4. We 
      also analyzed mRNA expression in the sputum of 10 normal and 19 pulmonary TB 
      patients. Expression of Tβ4 was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary 
      tuberculosis than in normal controls. These data suggest that Tβ4 is highly 
      expressed in granulomatous lung tissue with active pulmonary TB and is associated 
      with HIF-1α- and VEGF-mediated inflammation and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the 
      expression of Tβ4 in the sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients can be used as a 
      potential marker for diagnosis.

TI  - A complementary diagnosis of naturally occurring tuberculosis in water buffaloes 
      (Bubalus bubalis) in Rio de Janeiro using a MPB70-ELISA, Brazil.
PG  - 1203-6
LID - 10.1007/s11250-012-0347-2 [doi]
AB  - As tuberculosis is still a worldwide infection and buffalo breeding represents an 
      important economic activity in various countries, the purpose of this study was to 
      employ an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using MPB70 as a capture antigen 
      for the diagnosis of naturally occurring tuberculosis in water buffaloes in Brazil. 
      After the introduction of newly acquired cattle onto a tuberculosis (TB) free farm, 
      an outbreak of TB was recorded in a mixed herd comprising water buffaloes (21) and 
      cattle (46). The entire herd was tested by intradermal tuberculin injection (ITT) 
      and positive animals were slaughtered and tested by culture, polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR), and ELISA. From the 21 buffaloes sampled, three were reactive by 
      ITT. All the three had positive culture and ELISA, while PCR was positive in two of 
      them. Besides that, one ITT-negative buffalo was slaughtered and presented positive 
      results by both culture and ELISA, and was considered as anergic. Although there 
      were only few animals, those findings demonstrate the diagnostic usefulness of an 
      MPB70-ELISA to correctly detect Mycobacterium bovis tuberculosis in water buffaloes.

TI  - Utility of polymerase chain reaction in diagnosis of tuberculosis in our setup: a 
      ten years experience.
PG  - 298-301
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the yield of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis from different clinical specimens. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Armed 
      Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from January 2001 to December 2010. 
      METHODOLOGY: Different clinical specimens received for Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      PCR were dealt during the study period. Contaminated samples like sputum were 
      processed by the standard N-acetyl L-cysteine (NALC)-NaOH method. PCR protocols were 
      followed as per manufacturer's manual. PCR was performed using a Thermal Cycler 
      (Master Cycler, Eppendorf, Germany): an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 3 
      minutes was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing 
      at 60°C for 30 seconds and extension at 72°C for 30 seconds and a final extension at 
      72°C for 7 minutes. The products were held at 4°C and later run on 1% agarose gel, 
      stained with Ethidium bromide and visualized in ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator. 
      RESULTS: Out of a total 4620 samples for PCR, 299 were positive for Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (6.5%). The percentage of samples from male patients were 63.2%. The 
      mean age of patients was 38+11.5 years. Blood was the most frequent specimen 
      received for PCR (46.66%), followed by body fluids (18.41%) and CSF (10.64%). Yield 
      for different clinical samples was 63/471 for sputum (13.4%), 3/29 for endobronchial 
      washings (10.3%), 59/851 for body fluids (6.9%) and 24/400 for urine (6%). Positive 
      yield from blood was the lowest (101/2156, 4.7%). CONCLUSION: PCR for Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis is a rapid and reliable method for the diagnosis of both pulmonary and 
      extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The highest positive yield was obtained from sputum and 
      lowest from blood specimens.

AB  - Extrapulmonary manifestations constitute 15 to 20% of tuberculosis cases, with lymph 
      node tuberculosis (LNTB) as the most common form of infection. However, diagnosis 
      and treatment advances are hindered by lack of understanding of LNTB biology. To 
      identify host response, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected lymph nodes from LNTB 
      patients were studied by means of transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics 
      analyses. The selected targets obtained by comparative analyses were validated by 
      quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. This approach provided expression data 
      for 8,728 transcripts and 102 proteins, differentially regulated in the infected 
      human lymph node. Enhanced inflammation with upregulation of T-helper1-related 
      genes, combined with marked dysregulation of matrix metalloproteinases, indicates 
      tissue damage due to high immunoactivity at infected niche. This expression 
      signature was accompanied by significant upregulation of an immunoregulatory gene, 
      leukotriene A4 hydrolase, at both transcript and protein levels. Comparative 
      transcriptional analyses revealed LNTB-specific perturbations. In contrast to 
      pulmonary TB-associated increase in lipid metabolism, genes involved in fatty-acid 
      metabolism were found to be downregulated in LNTB suggesting differential lipid 
      metabolic signature. This study investigates the tissue molecular signature of LNTB 
      patients for the first time and presents findings that indicate the possible 
      mechanism of disease pathology through dysregulation of inflammatory and 
      tissue-repair processes.

TI  - Successful treatment of an AIDS patient with prolonged Mycobacterium avium

AB  - We report an AIDS patient with a high HIV RNA copy number in the plasma who was 
      successfully treated for prolonged Mycobacterium avium bacteremia and other 
      complications. An HIV-infected patient with high fever, anemia, high alkaline 
      phosphatase, cystic lung lesions, hepatitis B virus infection and Kaposi's sarcoma 
      was referred to our hospital. PCR of the blood revealed Mycobacterium avium 
      bacteremia and the time to blood culture positivity was 8 days. The HIV-1 RNA copy 
      number in the plasma was more than ten million copies/ml and the CD4-positive T cell 
      count was 21 cells/μL. Although the high fever resolved five days after therapy for 
      Mycobacterium avium was started, the fever recurred just before starting 
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART) including dolutegravir. The patient experienced 
      repeated but self-limiting bouts of severe inflammation. Mycobacteremia was 
      intermittently detected up to 79 days, suggesting that the recurrent episodes of 
      inflammation were due to the intermittent dissemination of mycobacteria, and that 
      persistent treatment is needed. Five months after the beginning of ART, the HIV-1 
      RNA copy number in the plasma was still 28,000 copies/ml. An HIV drug-resistance 
      test revealed sensitivity to all anti-retroviral drugs. Eleven months after the 
      initiation of ART, the HIV RNA copy number in the plasma decreased to 45 copies/mL 
      and the CD4-positive T cell count recovered to 205 cells/μL. Our case also suggests 
      that dolutegravir can be effective in cases with prolonged high levels of HIV RNA. 
      Our findings emphasize that prompt diagnosis and persistent therapy for 
      mycobacterial infection are important for successful treatment.

TI  - BCG Skin Infection Triggers IL-1R-MyD88-Dependent Migration of EpCAMlow CD11bhigh 
      Skin Dendritic cells to Draining Lymph Node During CD4+ T-Cell Priming.
PG  - e1005206
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005206 [doi]
LID - e1005206
AB  - The transport of antigen from the periphery to the draining lymph node (DLN) is 
      critical for T-cell priming but remains poorly studied during infection with 
      Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG). To address this we employed a 
      mouse model to track the traffic of Dendritic cells (DCs) and mycobacteria from the 
      BCG inoculation site in the skin to the DLN. Detection of BCG in the DLN was 
      concomitant with the priming of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells at that site. We found 
      EpCAMlow CD11bhigh migratory skin DCs to be mobilized during the transport of BCG to 
      the DLN. Migratory skin DCs distributed to the T-cell area of the LN, co-localized 
      with BCG and were found in close apposition to antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. 
      Consequently, blockade of skin DC traffic into DLN dramatically reduced 
      mycobacterial entry into DLN and muted T-cell priming. Interestingly, DC and 
      mycobacterial entry into the DLN was dependent on IL-1R-I, MyD88, TNFR-I and 
      IL-12p40. In addition, we found using DC adoptive transfers that the requirement for 
      MyD88 in BCG-triggered migration was not restricted to the migrating DC itself and 
      that hematopoietic expression of MyD88 was needed in part for full-fledged 
      migration. Our observations thus identify a population of DCs that contribute 
      towards the priming of CD4+ T cells to BCG infection by transporting bacilli into 
      the DLN in an IL-1R-MyD88-dependent manner and reveal both DC-intrinsic and 
      -extrinsic requirements for MyD88 in DC migration.

TI  - High nasopharyngeal pneumococcal density, increased by viral coinfection, is 
      associated with invasive pneumococcal pneumonia.
PG  - 1649-57
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiu326 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We identified factors associated with pneumococcal colonization, high 
      colonization density, and invasive pneumococcal pneumonia among patients 
      hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs). METHODS: In 
      2010, 4025 cases were enrolled in surveillance in South Africa. A total of 969 of 
      4025 systematically selected nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal specimens (24%) were 
      tested for respiratory viruses and Streptococcus pneumoniae by real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction. Of these, 749 (77%) had blood tested for S. pneumoniae. RESULTS: 
      Pneumococcal colonization was detected in 55% of cases (534 of 969). On 
      multivariable analysis that controlled for age and tuberculosis treatment, infection 
      with influenza virus (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.1-4.5), adenovirus (adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7), rhinovirus (adjusted OR, 
      1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; adjusted OR, 1.6; 95% 
      CI, 1.1-2.4) were associated with pneumococcal colonization. High colonization 
      density was associated with respiratory virus coinfection (adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 
      1.1-2.6) and invasive pneumococcal pneumonia (adjusted OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3-4.0), 
      after adjustment for age and sex. Seven percent (52 of 749) had pneumococci detected 
      in blood. On multivariable analysis among colonized cases, invasive pneumococcal 
      pneumonia was associated with HIV (adjusted OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.5), influenza 
      virus (adjusted OR, 8.2; 95% CI, 2.7-25.0), high colonization density (adjusted OR, 
      18.7; 95% CI, 2.3-155.1), and ≥5 days of hospitalization (adjusted OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 
      1.7-8.2). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory virus infection was associated with elevated 
      colonization density and, in turn, invasive pneumococcal pneumonia.

TI  - Prevalence of Bovine Tuberculosis in Egyptian Cattle and the Standardization of the 
      Interferon-gamma Assay as an Ancillary Test.
PG  - 497-507
LID - 10.1111/tbed.12291 [doi]
AB  - Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) caused primarily by Mycobacterium bovis continues to cause 
      significant losses in the cattle industry and is a major public health problem. 
      Despite its worldwide application, the IFN-γ assay has not been applied in Egypt. 
      The aim of this study was to determine the appropriate cut-off value of IFN-γ assay 
      to complement the skin test screening in Egypt. The relative sensitivity (Ser ) of 
      PPD and antigen cocktail-based IFN-γ assays (IFN-γ-BA and IFN-γ-EC) was analysed 
      retrospectively, relative to bTB confirmatory tests (culture and PCR), using single 
      cervical tuberculin (SCT) test reactors during 2011-2013. The absolute specificity 
      (Sp) was studied using blood samples collected from cattle from one bTB-free herd. 
      Analysis of the bTB database-generated sheets indicates the infection rate had 
      decreased from 2009 to 2012 and then increased in 2013. The disease is concentrated 
      in the Egyptian Nile Delta and Valley relative to elsewhere in the country. The 
      cut-offs for IFN-γ-EC assay could be optimized to provide higher sensitivity, 
      comparable to cut-offs for IFN-γ-BA assay. Data analysis suggests (PPDbOD  > 0.1, 
      PPDbOD  - NILOD  > 0.05 and PPDbOD  > PPDaOD ) and (ECOD  - NILOD  ≥ 0.1) cut-off 
      strategies to get optimal IFN-γ-BA and IFN-γ-EC assays results respectively. To our 
      knowledge, this is the first report describing the prevalence of bTB in cattle in 
      Egypt and pointing out the appropriate cut-off criteria to optimize IFN-γ assay as a 
      routine ancillary test for diagnosis of bTB in Egypt.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is the worldwide leading cause of death among HIV-infected 
      individuals, accounting for more than half of AIDS-related deaths. A high risk of 
      tuberculosis (TB) has been shown in early stages of the HIV disease, even in the 
      presence of normal CD4(+) cell counts. Moreover, the factors that determine 
      protective immunity vs. susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis cannot be fully 
      explained by simple changes in IFNγ levels or a shift from Th1 to Th2 cytokines. 
      This work investigated the relationship between cytokine expression profiles in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and susceptibility to M. tuberculosis in 
      10 HIV+ women who went onto develop TB. RNA transcripts for IL-4, IL-4δ2, IL-10, 
      IL-12(p35), IL-13, IL-17A, IFNγ and TNFα were measured by real-time quantitative PCR 
      in unstimulated or TB peptide antigen-stimulated PBMCs from 10 HIV+ women with 
      positive tuberculin skin tests (TST) and compared with HIV-seropositive and 
      seronegative women without previous TB and negative TST. Stimulated PBMC cultures 
      showed significantly lower expression of IL-12p35 (p=0.004) and IL-10 (p=0.026) in 
      the HIV+TB+ group 6-12months before onset of TB compared to HIV+TB- women. 
      Unstimulated PBMC from HIV+TB+ women also had lower expression of Th2 cytokines 
      [IL-4 (p=0.056) and IL-13 (p=0.050)] compared to HIV+TB- women. These results 
      suggest that lower IL-12 production by PBMC in response to TB antigens and lower 
      levels of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines by PBMC correlate with future development of TB 
      in HIV-infected women and may be responsible for their increased susceptibility.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the value of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay 
      (IGRA) (T-SPOT.TB) for patients with suspected osteoarticular tuberculosis (TB) in 
      comparison with conventional and molecular methods. Of 145 patients with suspected 
      osteoarticular TB, recruited from Beijing Chest Hospital between July 2011 and June 
      2012, 86 (59.3%)had osteoarticular TB (26 with culture-confirmed TB, 60 with 
      probable TB), 24 (16.6%) were not having active TB. The remaining 17 (11.7%) 
      inconclusive TB and 18 (12.4%) possible TB were excluded from final analysis. In 
      addition to conventional tests and molecular method, T-SPOT.TB assay using 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells to examine IFN-γ response to early secretory 
      antigenic target 6 and culture filtrate protein 10 was also performed. The 
      sensitivity and specificity for T-SPOT.TB assay were 94.2% and 70.8%, respectively. 
      A statistically significant difference in sensitivity was found between T-SPOT.TB 
      assay (94.2%) and other tests (acid-fast bacilli smear (19.7%), culture (34.2%), 
      real-time PCR (36.8%); P < 0.01, respectively). These results suggested that the 
      IGRA assay could provide useful aids in the diagnosis of osteoarticular TB.

AB  - The majority of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections remain asymptomatic with 
      only up to 10% progressing to clinical tuberculosis. However, the constituents of 
      the effective "protective immunity" against tuberculosis responsible for containing 
      most infections remain unknown. Evaluating gene transcriptional profiles in 
      tuberculosis clinical cohorts is one approach to understanding the spectrum of 
      tuberculosis progression. It is clear that apoptosis plays a role in the control of 
      tuberculosis but the utility of apoptosis-related genes as surrogate markers of 
      protection against tuberculosis has not been well investigated. To characterize 
      potential surrogate markers that could discriminate different phases of the clinical 
      tuberculosis spectrum, we investigated gene expression of several TNF-alpha 
      dependent apoptotic genes (TNFR1, TNFR2, FLICE, FLIPs) by real-time RT-PCR of 
      peripheral blood cells from cohorts of individuals with active tuberculosis or 
      potential exposure to tuberculosis. Newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients (n = 23), 
      their close household contacts (n = 80), and community controls (n = 46) were tested 
      at intervals over a period of up to two years. Latent infection or previous Mtb 
      contact was assessed by ELISPOT and TST and complete blood counts were performed 
      during the follow up. Results showed significant upregulation of FLIPs expression by 
      infected individuals regardless of clinical status at entry to the study. A higher 
      percentage of lymphocytes was found in the infected household contacts that remained 
      healthy. In contrast, in individuals with active TB, a significant upregulation of 
      TNFR2 expression, a significantly higher percentage of monocytes and a significantly 
      decreased lymphocyte count were seen, compared to subjects that remained healthy. 
      Moreover, the household contacts who subsequently developed signs of TB also had a 
      significantly high number of monocytes. These data suggest tuberculosis may be 
      associated with decreased T-cell survival (perhaps due to apoptosis) while 
      inhibition of apoptosis in monocytes could lead to a relative increase in these 
      cells: a situation predicted to favour Mtb.

TI  - Sensitive diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in a farmed cervid herd with use of an 
      MPB70 protein fluorescence polarization assay.
PG  - 161-6
AB  - After histopathological examination of a lesion found in a herd member returned a 
      diagnosis of mycobacteriosis, a farmed herd (n = 47) of elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) 
      and red deer (C. elaphus elaphus) was investigated for bovine tuberculosis with a 
      battery of antemortem and postmortem diagnostic tests. Every animal was tested with 
      the mid-cervical tuberculin skin test; all 47 had negative results. All of the 16 
      adult animals and 15 of the 31 calves (approximately 2-years-old) were blood-tested 
      with a lymphocyte stimulation test (LST) and a fluorescence polarization assay 
      (FPA), which detects antibody to the MPB70 protein antigen. At necropsy of the 31 
      blood-tested animals, tissues were harvested for histopathological examination and 
      culture of mycobacteria. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from 16 of the 31 animals, 
      and a scotochromogen was also isolated from 1 of the 16 whose tissues yielded M. 
      bovis. Each of these 16 animals, 15 of which were calves, also received a 
      histopathological diagnosis of mycobacteriosis. Other species of mycobacteria, 
      including those belonging to the M. avium and M. terrae complexes, were isolated 
      from an additional 7 animals. The FPA was scored "positive" or "suspect" for 16 
      animals, 13 (81%) of which were culture-positive for M. bovis. The other 3 animals 
      that were culture-positive for M. bovis had negative FPA results. Of the 3 
      FPA-positive or FPA-suspect animals that were culture-negative, 2 were suspected to 
      have mycobacteriosis on the basis of the histopathological examination. The 7 
      animals from which Mycobacterium species other than M. bovis were cultured were all 
      FPA-negative. The only animal with positive LST results was also FPA-positive and 
      culture-positive for M. bovis. The M. bovis isolates had an identical spoligotype 
      pattern, with an octal code of 664073777777600. This is the first report of the 
      isolation and identification of this strain type in Canada.

      tuberculosis.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential of diagnostic tests based 
      on interferon-gamma inducible protein (IP)-10 and monocyte chemotactic protein 
      (MCP)-2, and compare the performance with the QuantiFERON TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT; 
      Cellestis, Carnagie, Australia) test. IP-10 and MCP-2 were determined in 
      supernatants from whole blood stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific 
      antigens. Samples were obtained from 80 patients with culture- and/or PCR-proven 
      tuberculosis (TB), and 124 unexposed healthy controls: 86 high school students and 
      38 high school staff. IP-10 and MCP-2 test cut-offs were established based on 
      receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. TB patients produced significantly 
      higher levels (median) of IP-10 (2158 pg x mL(-1)) and MCP-2 (379 pg x mL(-1)) 
      compared with interferon (IFN)-gamma (215 pg x mL(-1)). The QFT-IT, IP-10 and MCP-2 
      tests detected 81, 83 and 71% of the TB patients; 0, 3 and 0% of the high school 
      students and 0, 16 and 3% of the staff, respectively. Agreement between tests was 
      high (>89%). By combining IP-10 and IFN-gamma tests, the detection rate increased 
      among TB patients to 90% without a significant increase in positive responders among 
      the students. In conclusion, interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 and monocyte 
      chemotactic protein-2 responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens 
      could be used to diagnose infection. Combining interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 
      and interferon-gamma may be a simple approach to increase the detection rate of the 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific in vitro tests.

      pulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - 1383-7
LID - 10.5588/ijtld.11.0827 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional C-159T polymorphism in the promoter region of the CD14 
      lipopolysaccharide receptor has been reported to be associated with the development 
      of tuberculosis (TB). OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of CD14 C-159T 
      polymorphism and serum soluble CD14 (sCD14) levels with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 
      in an Iranian population living in a TB-endemic area. DESIGN: A case-control study 
      was performed prospectively on 120 newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients and 131 
      healthy subjects. C-159T polymorphism was performed using amplification refractory 
      mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR). Concentrations of sCD14 were 
      measured in serum samples using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The 
      genotype frequencies of C-159T polymorphism differed significantly between TB 
      patients and controls (P = 0.006). The risk of TB was 2.3-fold greater in 
      individuals with the T-allele (CT + TT) in comparison to those without (OR 2.3, 
      95%CI 1.2-4.3, P = 0.006). Mean total sCD14 was significantly increased in the serum 
      of patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB (mean ± SD = 3177 ± 751 ng/ml) 
      compared to healthy controls (mean ± SD = 2955 ± 424 ng/ml, P < 0.004). CONCLUSION: 
      These data indicate that the C-159T polymorphism of the CD14 gene is associated with 
      TB; serum sCD14 levels were higher in TB patients in a sample of the Iranian 
      population.

LID - e37436
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measures of bacillary load in patients with tuberculosis (TB) may be 
      useful for predicting and monitoring response to treatment. The relationship between 
      quantitative T-cell responses and mycobacterial load remains unclear. We 
      hypothesised that, in a HIV-prevalent high burden setting, the magnitude of 
      mycobacterial antigen-specific and non-specific T-cell IFN-γ responses would 
      correlate with (a) bacterial load and (b) culture conversion in patients undergoing 
      treatment. METHODS: We compared baseline (n = 147), 2 (n = 35) and 6 month (n = 13) 
      purified-protein-derivative (PPD) and RD1-specific (TSPOT.TB and QFT-GIT) blood 
      RD1-specific (TSPOT.TB; QFT-GIT) responses with associates of sputum bacillary load 
      in patients with culture-confirmed TB in Cape Town, South Africa. RESULTS: IFN-γ 
      responses were not associated with liquid culture time-to-positivity, smear-grade, 
      Xpert MTB/RIF-generated cycle threshold values or the presence of cavities on the 
      chest radiograph in patients with culture-confirmed TB and irrespective of 
      HIV-status. 2-month IGRA conversion rates (positive-to-negative) were negligible 
      [<11% for TSPOT.TB (3/28) and QFT-GIT (1/29)] and lower compared to culture [60% 
      (21/35); p<0.01]. CONCLUSIONS: In a high burden HIV-prevalent setting T-cell IFN-γ 
      responses to M. tuberculosis-specific and non-specific antigens do not correlate 
      with bacillary load, including Xpert MTB/RIF-generated C(T) values, and are 
      therefore poorly suited for monitoring treatment and prognostication.

TI  - Sarcoidosis blood transcriptome reflects lung inflammation and overlaps with 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 1153-63
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201106-1143OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, although M. 
      tuberculosis may play a role in the pathogenesis. The traditional view holds that 
      inflammation in sarcoidosis is compartmentalized to involved organs. OBJECTIVES: To 
      determine whether whole blood gene expression signatures reflect inflammatory 
      pathways in the lung in sarcoidosis and whether these signatures overlap with 
      tuberculosis. METHODS: We analyzed transcriptomic data from blood and lung biopsies 
      in sarcoidosis and compared these profiles with blood transcriptomic data from 
      tuberculosis and other diseases. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Applying machine 
      learning algorithms to blood gene expression data, we built a classifier that 
      distinguished sarcoidosis from health in derivation and validation cohorts (92% 
      sensitivity, 92% specificity). The most discriminative genes were confirmed by 
      quantitative PCR and correlated with disease severity. Transcript profiles 
      significantly induced in blood overlapped with those in lung biopsies and identified 
      shared dominant inflammatory pathways (e.g., Type-I/II interferons). Sarcoidosis and 
      tuberculosis shared more overlap in blood gene expression compared with other 
      diseases using the 86-gene signature reported to be specific for tuberculosis and 
      the sarcoidosis signature presented herein, although reapplication of machine 
      learning algorithms could identify genes specific for sarcoidosis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      These data indicate that blood transcriptome analysis provides a noninvasive method 
      for identifying inflammatory pathways in sarcoidosis, that these pathways may be 
      leveraged to complement more invasive procedures for diagnosis or assessment of 
      disease severity, and that sarcoidosis and tuberculosis share overlap in gene 
      regulation of specific inflammatory pathways.

TI  - [Diagnostic guideline of intestinal tuberculosis].
PG  - 177-86
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a still prevalent and important disease entity in Korea. TB can 
      involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract, and intestinal TB is an important 
      disease of extra-pulmonary TB. The diagnosis of intestinal TB remains a challenge 
      because the signs and symptoms are nonspecific. It should be differentiated from the 
      inflammatory bowel diseases and malignancies, especially Crohn's disease. The 
      diagnosis of intestinal TB should be based on careful clinical evaluation, such as 
      extra-intestinal signs, colonoscopic and histologic evaluation. Newer techniques 
      such as PCR method or test for the diagnosis of latent TB (Interferon-gamma assay) 
      may be helpful. In addition, a high index of suspicion must be kept in mind to 
      ensure a timely diagnosis. Herein, IBD Study Group of the KASID proposes a 
      diagnostic guideline based on currently available evidence and experience, 
      especially those of Korea. We also propose the test which may be helpful to 
      establish the proper diagnosis of intestinal TB.

TI  - Cytokine gene expression in intestinal tuberculosis and Crohn's disease.
PG  - 662-8
LID - 10.5588/ijtld.12.0600 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal tuberculosis (TB) and Crohn's disease closely resemble each 
      other clinically and morphologically. Little is known of cytokine regulation in 
      intestinal TB. OBJECTIVE: To compare cytokine gene expression in colonic mucosa and 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in TB with that in Crohn's disease. 
      METHODS: Biopsies were obtained from normal and ulcerated colonic mucosa of 12 
      intestinal TB and 11 Crohn's disease patients, and PBMC from 15 intestinal TB and 12 
      Crohn's disease patients and 11 healthy volunteers. RNA was extracted, and the 
      expression of selected cytokines, chemokines and pattern recognition receptors 
      quantified by reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction using SYBR 
      green. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), induced protein-10, 
      tumour necrosis factor-alpha, IL-23 p19 and IL-12 p40, and Toll-like receptors (TLR) 
      1 and 2 in the ulcerated mucosa was increased in both intestinal TB and Crohn's 
      disease. Expression of growth-related oncogene-alpha was increased in intestinal TB, 
      while expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-) and TLR 4, 5 and 9 was increased in 
      Crohn's disease. Expression of RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell 
      expressed and secreted) was decreased in Crohn's disease. Secretion of IFN- or IL-10 
      from PBMC was not significantly altered in either disease. PBMC mRNA expression of 
      IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA was upregulated in Crohn's disease, while that of IL-17 was 
      upregulated in intestinal TB. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine gene expression patterns in 
      intestinal mucosa and PBMC of intestinal TB were remarkably similar to Crohn's 
      disease, and demonstrated innate immune activation and T-helper 1 polarisation.

TI  - A more reliable PCR for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical samples.
PG  - 672-8
AB  - Diagnostic techniques based on PCR have two major problems: false-positive reactions 
      due to contamination with DNA fragments from previous PCRs (amplicons) and 
      false-negative reactions caused by inhibitors that interfere with the PCR. We have 
      improved our previously reported PCR based on the amplification of a fragment of the 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex-specific insertion element IS6110 with respect to 
      both problems. False-positive reactions caused by amplicon contamination were 
      prevented by the use of uracil-N-glycosylase and dUTP instead of dTTP. We selected a 
      new set of primers outside the region spanned by the formerly used primers to avoid 
      false-positive reactions caused by dTTP-containing amplicons still present in the 
      laboratory. With this new primer set, 16 copies of the IS6110 insertion element, the 
      equivalent of two bacteria, could be amplified 10(10) times in 40 cycles, resulting 
      in a mean efficiency of 77% per cycle. To detect the presence of inhibitors of the 
      Taq polymerase, which may cause false-negative reactions, part of each sample was 
      spiked with M. tuberculosis DNA. The DNA purification method using guanidinium 
      thiocyanate and diatoms effectively removed most or all inhibitors of the PCR. 
      However, this was not suitable for blood samples, for which we developed a 
      proteinase K treatment followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. This method 
      permitted detection of 20 M. tuberculosis bacteria per ml of whole blood. Various 
      laboratory procedures were introduced to reduce failure or inhibition of PCR and 
      avoid DNA cross contamination. We have tested 218 different clinical specimens 
      obtained from patients suspected of having tuberculosis. The samples included sputum 
      (n=145), tissue biopsy samples (n=25), cerebrospinal fluid (n=15), blood (n=14), 
      pleural fluid (n=9), feces, (n=7), fluid from fistulae (n=2), and pus from a wound 
      (n=1). The results obtained by PCR were consistent with those obtained with culture, 
      which is the "gold standard." We demonstrate that PCR is a useful technique for the 
      rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis at various sites.

TI  - BATF Potentially Mediates Negative Regulation of PD-1/PD-Ls Pathway on T Cell 
      Functions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection.

AB  - Background: Previously, we have found that blockade of PD-1/PD-Ls pathway could 
      enhance CD4(+) T cells-mediated protective immunity in patients with active 
      tuberculosis (ATB). However, the mechanism of PD-1/PD-Ls pathway involved in 
      negative regulation of anti-TB immunity has been still unclear. Recently, the study 
      of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection demonstrated that PD-1 could induce 
      the expression of basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (BATF) to 
      inhibit CD8(+) T cell function. While the mechanism of immune regulation of BATF in 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) infection has not yet been elucidated. Methods: 
      We enrolled 104 participants including ATB patients (n = 66), latent tuberculosis 
      infection (LTBI) (n = 16) and healthy control (HC) (n = 22). The expressions of BATF 
      in peripheral blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from enrolled subjects were determined 
      using flow cytometry. Intervention with PD-1/PD-Ls pathway was performed by using 
      blocking antibodies or human PD-L1 fusion protein. Silencing BATF in peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by electroporation with siRNA. Real-time 
      quantitative PCR, CFSE dilution assay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
      were employed to test T cell functions after BATF knockdown. Results: The 
      percentages of BATF(+)CD4(+) (P = 0.0003 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and 
      BATF(+)CD8(+) (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0003, respectively) cells were significantly 
      increased in ATB patients compared with LTBI and HC. BATF-expressing PD-1(+) T cells 
      in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were much higher in ATB group than those in LTBI group 
      (P = 0.0426 and 0.0104, respectively) and HC group (P = 0.0133 and 0.0340, 
      respectively). There was a positive correlation between BATF expression and PD-1 
      expression in ATB patients (for CD4(+) T cells, r = 0.6761, P = 0.0158; for CD8(+) T 
      cells, r = 0.6104, P = 0.0350). BATF knockdown could enhance IL-2 and IFN-γ 
      secretions (P = 0.0485 and 0.0473, respectively) and CD4(+) T cells proliferation (P 
      = 0.0041) in vitro. Conclusions: In the context of tuberculosis, BATF mediates 
      negative regulation of PD-1/PD-Ls pathway on T cell functions. BATF knockdown can 
      improve cytokine secretion and cells proliferation in vitro.

TI  - A prospective study of the prevalence of tuberculosis and bacteraemia in Bangladeshi 
      children with severe malnutrition and pneumonia including an evaluation of Xpert 
      MTB/RIF assay.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe malnutrition is a risk factor for pneumonia due to a wide range 
      of pathogens but aetiological data are limited and the role of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis is uncertain. METHODS: We prospectively investigated severely 
      malnourished young children (<5 years) with radiological pneumonia admitted over a 
      15-month period. Investigations included blood culture, sputa for microscopy and 
      mycobacterial culture. Xpert MTB/RIF assay was introduced during the study. Study 
      children were followed for 12 weeks following their discharge from the hospital. 
      RESULTS: 405 eligible children were enrolled, with a median age of 10 months. 
      Bacterial pathogens were isolated from blood culture in 18 (4.4%) children, of which 
      72% were Gram negatives. Tuberculosis was confirmed microbiologically in 7% (27/396) 
      of children that provided sputum - 10 by culture, 21 by Xpert MTB/RIF assay, and 4 
      by both tests. The diagnostic yield from induced sputum was 6% compared to 3.5% from 
      gastric aspirate. Sixty (16%) additional children had tuberculosis diagnosed 
      clinically that was not microbiologically confirmed. Most confirmed tuberculosis 
      cases did not have a positive contact history or positive tuberculin test. The 
      sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF assay compared to culture was 67% (95% 
      CI: 24-94) and 92% (95% CI: 87-95) respectively. Overall case-fatality rate was 17% 
      and half of the deaths occurred in home following discharge from the hospital. 
      CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: TB was common in severely malnourished Bangladeshi 
      children with pneumonia. X-pert MTB/RIF assay provided higher case detection rate 
      compared to sputum microscopy and culture. The high mortality among the study 
      children underscores the need for further research aimed at improved case detection 
      and management for better outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The clinical, endoscopic, and histological features of Crohn's disease 
      (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis mimic each other so much that it becomes difficult 
      to differentiate between them. The aim was to find out clinical, endoscopic, and 
      histological predictor features for differentiation between CD and intestinal 
      tuberculosis. METHODS: We recruited 106 patients, 53 each with CD and intestinal 
      tuberculosis, in this study. The clinical, histological, and endoscopic features 
      were subjected to univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. On the basis of 
      regression coefficients of the final multivariate logistic model, a score to 
      discriminate between CD and intestinal tuberculosis was devised. For the validation 
      of the score, the same model was tested on 20 new patients, each with CD and 
      intestinal tuberculosis. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, although longer duration 
      of disease, chronic diarrhea, blood in stool, perianal disease, extra-intestinal 
      manifestations, involvement of left colon, skip lesions, aphthous ulcers, 
      cobblestoning, longitudinal ulcers, focally enhanced colitis, and microgranulomas 
      were significantly more common in CD, partial intestinal obstruction, constipation, 
      presence of nodular lesions, higher number, and larger granulomas were significantly 
      more common in intestinal tuberculosis. On multivariate analysis, blood in stool 
      (odds ratio (OR) 0.1 (confidence interval (CI) 0.04-0.5)), weight loss (OR 9.8 (CI 
      2.2-43.9)), histologically focally enhanced colitis (OR 0.1 (CI 0.03-0.5)), and 
      involvement of sigmoid colon (OR 0.07(0.01-0.3)) were independent predictors of 
      intestinal tuberculosis. On the basis of regression coefficients of the final 
      multivariate logistic model, a score that varied from 0.3 to 9.3 was devised. Higher 
      score predicted more likelihood of intestinal tuberculosis. Once the cutoff was set 
      at 5.1, then the sensitivity, specificity, and ability to correctly classify the two 
      diseases were 83.0, 79.2, and 81.1%, respectively. Area under the curve for 
      receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) to assess the ability of these features to 
      discriminate between CD and intestinal tuberculosis was 0.9089. The area under ROC 
      in the validation data set was 89.2% (95% CI 0.79-0.99). With a similar cutoff score 
      of 5.1, sensitivity and specificity in the validation model were 90% (95% CI 
      66.9-98.2) and 60% (95% CI 36.4-80.0), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood in stool, 
      weight loss, focally enhanced colitis, and involvement of the sigmoid colon were the 
      most important features in differentiating CD from intestinal tuberculosis.

AB  - Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenesae-1 (IDO-1) catalyses the initial, rate-limiting step in 
      tryptophan metabolism, thereby regulating tryptophan availability and the formation 
      of downstream metabolites, including picolinic and quinolinic acid. We found that 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection induced marked upregulation of IDO-1 expression 
      in both human and murine macrophages in vitro and in the lungs of mice following 
      aerosol challenge with M. tuberculosis. The absence of IDO-1 in dendritic cells 
      enhanced the activation of mycobacteria-specific T cells in vitro. Interestingly, 
      IDO-1-deficiency during M. tuberculosis infection in mice was not associated with 
      altered mycobacteria-specific T cell responses in vivo. The bacterial burden of 
      infected organs, pulmonary inflammatory responses, and survival were also comparable 
      in M. tuberculosis-infected IDO-1 deficient and wild type animals. Tryptophan is 
      metabolised into either picolinic acid or quinolinic acid, but only picolinic acid 
      inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro. By contrast macrophages infected 
      with pathogenic mycobacteria, produced quinolinic, rather than picolinic acid, which 
      did not reduce M. tuberculosis growth in vitro. Therefore, although M. tuberculosis 
      induces robust expression of IDO-1 and activation of tryptophan metabolism, 
      IDO-1-deficiency fails to impact on the immune control and the outcome of the 
      infection in the mouse model of tuberculosis.

TI  - PCR detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in necrotising non-granulomatous 
      lymphadenitis using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue: a study in Thai 
      patients.
PG  - 812-5
LID - 10.1136/jcp.2008.062828 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotising non-granulomatous lymphadenitis can be observed in several 
      conditions, most notably infection (including tuberculosis, yersiniosis and 
      nocardiasis), Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease and systemic lupus erythematosus. AIMS: To 
      evaluate the role of PCR in the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 
      necrotising non-granulomatous lymphadenitis in Thai patients using formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded tissue. METHODS: 35 patient samples showing necrotising 
      non-granulomatous lymphadenitis were subjected to PCR for detection of the IS6110 
      sequence of M tuberculosis. For comparison, sections were visually assessed for 
      acid-fast bacilli using the Ziehl-Neelsen stain. RESULTS: Among 35 cases of 
      necrotising non-granulomatous lymphadenitis, a conclusive diagnosis could be reached 
      in 23 cases: 15 cases of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, 6 of tuberculosis and 2 of 
      systemic lupus erythematosus. Of the 6 cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis, 4 (66.6%) 
      were detected by PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples. PCR was 
      positive in 6/12 of the remaining cases (50%) in which a definitive diagnosis could 
      not be reached by other methods. CONCLUSION: Using PCR, a significant percentage 
      (28%) of cases of necrotising non-granulomatous lymphadenitis in this study could be 
      attributed to M tuberculosis. PCR for identification of the organism can be 
      extremely helpful in confirming a diagnosis of tuberculosis when Ziehl-Neelsen 
      staining is negative.

AB  - A commercially available multi-antigen lateral flow assay (LFA) for detection of 
      antibodies to Mycobacterium bovis was evaluated by testing dairy cattle in Baja 
      California, México. Sera and tissue samples were obtained from 268 dairy cattle at a 
      slaughterhouse and were tested by LFA, bacteriological culture, and polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR). Of 107 culture positive samples, 70 (65.4%) were positive by PCR and 
      49 (45.8%) were positive by LFA. The PCR and LFA gave positive results with an 
      additional 59 (36.6%) and 77 (47.8%) of the 161 culture negative samples, 
      respectively. The false negative rate for the PCR was 34.6% and 54.2% for the LFA. 
      Due to the high false positive rate for both PCR and LFA observed in this study, the 
      LFA cannot be a useful test, even in combination with PCR.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to compare the whole blood interferon-γ release assay 
      (IGRA) with the traditional methods for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) 
      infection in children. Fifteen childhood patients with tuberculosis and 15 healthy 
      children were recruited. Sputa samples and venous blood were collected, and 
      according to different procedures, IGRA, sputum smear, colloidal gold assay (CGA), 
      fluorescence quantitation polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR), and tuberculosis skin 
      test (TST) were, respectively, performed. Thirty healthy children vaccinated with 
      Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) were also recruited, and the comparative test was 
      carried out between IGRA and TST. In all of 15 childhood patients with TB, the 
      positive rates were 86.7%, 20.0%, 26.7%, 40%, and 66.7% in IGRA, sputum smear, CGA, 
      FQ-PCR, and TST, respectively. In the children vaccinated with BCG, the positive 
      rate of IGRA was significantly lower than that of TST (6.7% vs 76.7%). From high to 
      low, the specificities of the five methods were sputum smear (100%), IGRA (86.7%), 
      FQ-PCR (86.7%), TST (40%), and CGA (26.7%). Although the specificities of sputum 
      smear and FQ-PCR were more than or equal to that of IGRA, the relative sensitivities 
      limited their applications in populations of children. IGRA is a sensitive and 
      specific method, and could be taken as a first choice for detecting MTB infection in 
      populations of children.

AB  - Disseminated Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC) infection is 
      considered as severe complication of advanced HIV/AIDS disease. Currently available 
      various laboratory investigations have not only limited ability to discriminate 
      between MAC infection and tuberculosis but are also laborious and time consuming. 
      The aim of this study was, therefore, to design a molecular-based strategy for 
      specific detection of MAC and its differentiation from Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      (M. tb) isolated from the blood specimens of HIV patients. A simple PCR was 
      developed based on the amplification of 120-bp katG-N gene corresponding to the 
      first 40 amino acids of N-terminal catalase-peroxidase (KatG) protein of 
      Mycobacterium avium that shows only ~13% sequence homology by clustal W alignment to 
      N-terminal region of M. tb KatG protein. This assay allowed the accurate and rapid 
      detection of MAC bacteremia, distinguishing it from M. tb in a single PCR reaction 
      without any need for sequencing or hybridization protocol to be performed 
      thereafter. This study produced enough evidence that a significant proportion of 
      Indian HIV patients have disseminated MAC bacteremia, suggesting the utility of M. 
      avium katG-N gene PCR for early detection of MAC disease in HIV patients.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global infectious disease. To investigate the value of a 
      novel Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) region of difference 5 
      (RD5)-encoded antigen, Rv3117, in the development of effective immuno-diagnostics 
      and vaccines against TB, the immune responses to the antigen were examined in human 
      subjects, as well as in C57BL/6 mice. The results showed that Rv3117 was able to 
      evoke specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Consistent with the results 
      from the RD1-encoded antigens, culture filtrate protein 10 kDa (CFP-10) and early 
      secreted antigenic target 6 kDa (ESAT-6), the immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM and IgA 
      antibody responses to Rv3117 were able to statistically distinguish between the 65 
      patients with active pulmonary TB and the 59 healthy controls (P<0.01, 
      respectively). In addition, higher levels of Rv3117‑specific interferon-γ (IFN-γ) 
      were observed in immunized C57BL/6 mice than in the negative control mice (P<0.05). 
      Furthermore, high titers of total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were present in the 
      sera from immunized mice, even six weeks subsequent to the immunization. In 
      conclusion, the present results suggested that Rv3117 may be used as a candidate for 
      the development of TB immunodiagnostics and vaccine design.

TI  - Diagnosis of tuberculous vertebral osteomyelitis (TVO) in a developed country and 
      literature review.
PG  - 531-42
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Review of medical and radiological records and literature to study the 
      diagnosis of tuberculous vertebral osteomyelitis (TVO) and the differential 
      diagnosis between TVO and pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis (PVO). OBJECTIVE: To 
      identify the correct criteria for the diagnosis. SETTING: National Spinal Injuries 
      Centre, UK. METHODS: (1) Medical and radiological records of 10 patients diagnosed 
      as vertebral osteomyelitis and treated elsewhere but later admitted to the NSIC were 
      reviewed retrospectively. (2) Medical literature on vertebral osteomyelitis were 
      reviewed. RESULTS: (1) Case review: Before the study, four of the 10 patients TVO 
      had been diagnosed based on positive bacteriology. Of the other six, the diagnosis 
      of PVO had been made in one based on positive blood culture of staphylococcus while 
      in another without any positive result of bacteriology. The diagnosis had been 
      uncertain in four because of negative results of both bacteriology and histology on 
      both tuberculous and pyogenic infection. The author made the diagnosis of TVO in all 
      10 cases based on clinical manifestations and plain radiographs. Highly raised ESR 
      with moderate rise of or normal WBC in eight cases supported TVO. Computer 
      tomography and magnetic resonance imaging did not contribute to the differential 
      diagnosis. Laminectomy in five patients led to some clinical improvement. The five 
      patients without surgery deteriorated. Two of them died. (2) LITERATURE REVIEW: A 
      total of 188 articles were reviewed. The crucial role of plain radiographs in the 
      diagnosis of TVO and the high incidence of false-negative of tuberculosis in both 
      bacteriological and histological tests were neglected in most articles. Polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) was more reliable in diagnosing tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: 
      Clinical manifestations, discrepancy between ESR and WBC, plain radiographs and PCR 
      are keys to a correct diagnosis of TVO.

TI  - Development of a test for bovine tuberculosis in cattle based on measurement of 
      gamma interferon mRNA by real-time PCR.
PG  - 117
LID - 10.1136/vr.101552 [doi]
AB  - The infection status of cattle for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) was determined by 
      real-time PCR, comparing the levels of IFN-γ mRNA in blood cultures stimulated with 
      either bovine or avian tuberculin with non-stimulated control (phosphate buffer 
      saline, PBS) blood culture. Totally, 137 cattle were tested to validate the assay, 
      in which 54 were IFN-γ real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) positive, while the 
      remaining 83 were found negative. Meanwhile, the IFN-γ ELISA test was carried out 
      using the Bovigam IFN-γ detection ELISA kit and these results were used as a 
      standard. The results of the single intradermal tuberculin tests (SIDT) and IFN-γ 
      RT-qPCR tests were compared and revealed that the RT-qPCR correlated better with the 
      ELISA and its accuracy was higher than SIDT. This indicates the RT-qPCR is a useful 
      diagnostic method for bTB in cattle. However, several limitations remain for our 
      approach, such as lack of a TB lesions or postmortem test results as a gold 
      standard. Further improvements should be made in the future to increase accuracy of 
      diagnosis of bTB in cattle.

      mycobacteria.
PG  - 6482-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1219985110 [doi]
AB  - We have used humanized mice, in which human immune cells differentiate de novo from 
      transplanted cord blood progenitor cells, to study the human immune responses to 
      infection with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin and Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis. Granulomas with a core containing giant cells, human CD68(+) 
      macrophages, and high bacilli numbers surrounded by a layer of CD3(+) T cells and a 
      fibrotic response encapsulating the lesions were observed in livers and lungs from 
      bacillus Calmette-Guérin-infected humanized mice but not in nonhumanized infected 
      controls. Paradoxically, humanized mice contained higher mycobacterial numbers in 
      organs than nonhumanized controls. The enhancement of bacterial load was mediated by 
      human CD4(+) cells and associated to an increased expression of Programmed Death-1 
      protein and CD57 on T cells, molecules associated with inhibition and senescence. 
      The lesions from mice depleted of CD4(+) cells were scarcer, minimal, and irregular 
      compared with those from mice depleted of CD8(+) cells or nondepleted controls. 
      Granulomas of bacillus Calmette-Guérin-infected humanized mice administered with a 
      TNF-neutralizing TNF receptor fusion molecule preserved their structure, but 
      contained higher levels of intracellular bacilli. Extended necrosis was observed in 
      granulomas from M. tuberculosis- but not bacillus Calmette-Guérin-infected humanized 
      mice. Our data indicate that humanized mice can be used as a model to study the 
      formation and maintenance of human granuloma in tuberculosis and other infectious or 
      noninfectious diseases.

TI  - Effect of anti-tuberculosis therapy on polymorphic drug metabolizing enzyme CYP2C9 
      using phenytoin as a probe drug.
PG  - 485-8
LID - 10.4103/0253-7613.99314 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Patients on anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) are more prone to drug 
      interactions in the presence of coexisting illnesses which warrant drug therapy. 
      Rifampicin is a strong CYP enzyme inducer while isoniazid is a potent CYP inhibitor. 
      The objective of the study was to find the net effect of one month ATT on CYP2C9 
      enzyme and to correlate it with respect to the CYP2C9 genetic polymorphisms. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty eight newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients were 
      included in the study based on the inclusion-exclusion criteria. Before commencing 
      ATT, they were given a single dose of phenytoin 300 mg as a probe drug for CYP2C9. 
      Blood sample was collected after three hours to carry out CYP2C9 genotyping by 
      PCR-RFLP method. Phenotyping for CYP2C9 enzyme was done by measuring the ratio of 
      phenytoin and its metabolite p-HPPH (para hydroxy phenyl hydantoin) by reverse phase 
      HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) method before and after one month of 
      ATT. RESULTS: In the CYP2C9*1*1 genotype, the mean plasma concentrations of 
      phenytoin before and after one month of ATT were 5.2 ± 0.3 μg/ml and 3.5 ± 0.4 μg/ml 
      respectively, a reduction by 33% showing significant induction (P < 0.001). There 
      was also significant decrease in the metabolic ratio after one month of ATT from 
      23.2 ± 4.8 to 10.1 ± 1.9 (P < 0.001). The metabolic ratio was also observed to 
      reduce significantly (P < 0.05) when the CYP2C9*1*2, CYP2C9*1*3, and CYP2C9*3*3 data 
      were pooled together. CONCLUSION: The presence of polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 gene 
      does not affect the induction potential of ATT.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro studies of a novel cytokine, interleukin 4delta2, in pulmonary 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 501-8
AB  - RATIONALE: Tuberculosis progresses despite potent Th1 responses. A putative 
      explanation is the simultaneous presence of a subversive Th2 response. However, 
      interpretation is confounded by interleukin 4delta2 (IL-4delta2), a splice variant 
      and inhibitor of IL-4. OBJECTIVE: To study levels of mRNA encoding IL-4 and 
      IL-4delta2, and their relationship to treatment and clinical parameters, in cells 
      from lung lavage and blood from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: 
      IL-4delta2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and soluble CD30 (sCD30) levels were measured by 
      polymerase chain reaction and relevant immunoassays in 29 patients and matched 
      control subjects lacking responses to tuberculosis-specific antigens. RESULTS: mRNA 
      levels for IL-4 and IL-4delta2 were elevated in unstimulated cells from blood and 
      lung lavage of patients versus control subjects (p < 0.005). In control subjects, 
      there were low basal levels of IL-4 and IL-4delta2 mRNA expressed mainly by non-T 
      cells (p < 0.05). However, in patients, there were greater levels of mRNA for both 
      cytokines in both T- and non-T-cell populations (p < 0.05 compared with control 
      subjects). Radiologic disease correlated with the IL-4/IFN-gamma ratio and sCD30 (p 
      < 0.005). After chemotherapy, IL-4 mRNA levels remained unchanged, whereas 
      IL-4delta2 increased in parallel with IFN-gamma (p < 0.05). Sonicates of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis upregulated expression of IL-4 relative to IL-4delta2 in 
      mononuclear cell cultures from patients (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A Th2-like 
      response, prominent in T cells and driven by tuberculosis antigen, is present in 
      tuberculosis and modulated by treatment, suggesting a role for IL-4 and IL-4delta2 
      in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis and their ratio as a possible marker of disease 
      activity. The specific antigens inducing the IL-4 response require identification to 
      facilitate future vaccine development strategies.

TI  - Syndecan-1 and heparanase: potential markers for activity evaluation and 
      differential diagnosis of Crohn's disease.
PG  - 1025-33
LID - 10.1097/MIB.0b013e318280298f [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Syndecan-1 (SDC1) and its endo-beta-D-glucuronidase heparanase (HPA) are 
      implicated in the maintenance of intestinal barrier function, but their detailed 
      functions in Crohn's disease (CD) are not fully investigated. The aim of this study 
      was to determine alteration patterns of SDC1 and HPA and their potential roles in 
      evaluating disease activity and differentiating CD from intestinal tuberculosis 
      (ITB). METHODS: Tissue and serum specimens were obtained from 89 patients, including 
      15 patients with functional bowel disorders, 18 active patients with ITB, and 56 
      patients with CD (remission = 19, active = 37). Basic clinical data were collected 
      and routine blood tests were analyzed. SDC1 and HPA were measured by 
      immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, reverse transcriptase 
      polymerase chain reaction, and western blot. Colonic epithelial cells were incubated 
      with recombinant HPA, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis culture filtrate protein to detect the alterations of SDC1 and HPA. 
      RESULTS: In the CD group, SDC1 was significantly decreased in mucosa and increased 
      in serum, whereas HPA level in both were elevated. Such alterations were associated 
      with clinicopathological features representing disease activity and injury severity 
      and were not available in functional bowel disorder and ITB groups. Recombinant HPA 
      incubation increased soluble SDC1 in culture supernatants (P = 2 × 10(-4)), and 
      low-dose TNF-α effectively enhanced HPA's activity (P = 3 × 10(-6)). Exogenous TNF-α 
      destroyed cellular SDC1 and raised HPA expressions dose dependently, whereas 
      mycobacterium tuberculosis culture filtrate protein showed no effects. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Unique alterations of SDC1 and HPA are shown in both patients with CD and in vitro 
      model. The results indicate SDC1 and HPA are potential markers for CD in evaluating 
      its disease activity and differentiating it from ITB.

TI  - [A CASE OF SUBPHRENIC ABSCESS WITH PARADOXICAL RESPONSE CAUSED BY MYCOBACTERIUM 
      TUBERCULOSIS].
PG  - 35-39
AB  - A 40-year-old woman was admitted to our hos- pital with cough and sputum production. 
      A chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a diffuse nodular shadow in the upper 
      lung. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis, based on a positive 
      T-SPOT®.TB test result of peripheral blood and a positive polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) test result for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in gastric aspirates. 
      M.tuberculosis was subsequently isolated from the gastric aspirate specimen. After 2 
      months of treatment with antituberculous medication, the patient developed a low 
      grade fever and left-sided chest pain. A CT scan revealed a left pleural effusion 
      and a right subphrenic abscess. Tuber- culous pleurisy with paradoxical response was 
      diagnosed on the basis of an increased lymphocyte count and increased adenosine 
      deaminase activity in the pleural fluid exudate. A percutaneous ultrasound-guided 
      needle biopsy of the sub- phrenic abscess was performed. Histological analysis 
      revealed epithelioid cell granulomas with necrosis and PCR for M. tuberculosis using 
      puncture needle washing fluid returned positive results. Based on these findings, a 
      diagnosis of subphrenic abscess with paradoxical response, caused by M. 
      tuberculosis, was made. Subphrenic abscess caused by M. tuberculosis is an important 
      consideration during antituber- culous therapy.

TI  - Circulating microRNAs in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - 4246-51
LID - 10.1128/JCM.05459-11 [doi]
AB  - Emerging evidence shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in 
      pathogen-host interactions. Circulating miRNAs have been repeatedly and stably 
      detected in blood and hold promise to serve as molecular markers for diverse 
      physiological and pathological conditions. To date, the relationship between 
      circulating miRNAs and active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) has not been reported. 
      Using microarray-based expression profiling followed by real-time quantitative PCR 
      validation, the levels of circulating miRNAs were compared between patients with 
      active pulmonary tuberculosis and matched healthy controls. The receiver operating 
      characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic effect of selected miRNA. 
      Bioinformatic analysis was used to explore the potential roles of these circulating 
      miRNAs in active pulmonary tuberculosis infection. Among 92 miRNAs significantly 
      detected, 59 miRNAs were downregulated and 33 miRNAs were upregulated in the TB 
      serum compared to their levels in the control serum. Interestingly, only two 
      differentially expressed miRNAs were increased not only in the serum but also in the 
      sputum of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared to the levels for the 
      healthy controls. Upregulated miR-29a could discriminate TB patients from healthy 
      controls with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. A number of significantly 
      enriched pathways regulated by these circulating miRNAs were predicted, and most of 
      them were involved in acute-phase response, inflammatory response, and the 
      regulation of the cytoskeleton. In all, for the first time our results revealed that 
      a number of miRNAs were differentially expressed during active pulmonary 
      tuberculosis infection, and circulating miR-29a has great potential to serve as a 
      marker for the detection of active pulmonary tuberculosis infection.

TI  - Prognostic value of a quantitative analysis of lipoarabinomannan in urine from 
      patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis.
PG  - e103285
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0103285 [doi]
LID - e103285
AB  - BACKGROUND: Detection of the mycobacterial cell wall antigen lipoarabinomannan (LAM) 
      in urine can be used to diagnose HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB) using a 
      qualitative (positive/negative) read-out. However, it is not known whether the 
      quantity of LAM present in urine provides additional prognostic information. 
      METHODS/FINDINGS: Consecutively recruited adult outpatients initiating 
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa were investigated for TB regardless of 
      clinical symptoms using sputum smear microscopy and liquid culture (reference 
      standard). Urine samples were tested using the Clearview TB-ELISA for LAM and the 
      Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The ELISA optical densities (OD) were used as a quantitative 
      assessment of urine LAM. Among 514 patients with complete sputum and urine LAM OD 
      results, culture-confirmed TB was diagnosed in 84 patients. Twenty-three (27.3%) 
      were LAM-positive with a median LAM OD of 0.68 (IQR 0.16-2.43; range, 0.10-3.29) and 
      61 (72.6%) were LAM negative (LAM OD <0.1 above background). Higher LAM ODs were 
      associated with a range of prognostic indices, including lower CD4 cell counts, 
      lower haemoglobin levels, higher blood neutrophil counts and higher mycobacterial 
      load as assessed using both sputum and urine samples. The median LAM OD among 
      patients who died was more than 6.8-fold higher than that of patients who remained 
      alive at 3 months (P<0.001). The small number of deaths, however, precluded adequate 
      assessment of mortality risk stratified according to urine LAM OD. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      patients with HIV-associated TB, concentrations of LAM in urine were strongly 
      associated with a range of poor prognostic characteristics known to be associated 
      with mortality risk. Urine LAM assays with a semi-quantitative (negative vs. 
      low-positive vs. high-positive) read-out may have improved clinical utility over 
      assays with a simple binary result.

TI  - Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium 
      infections in a tule elk (Cervus elaphus nannodes) herd.
PG  - 715-23
AB  - Between 2 August and 22 September 2000, 37 hunter-killed tule elk (Cervus elaphus 
      nannodes) were evaluated at the Grizzly Island Wildlife Area, California, USA, for 
      evidence of paratuberculosis. Elk were examined post-mortem, and tissue and fecal 
      samples were submitted for radiometric mycobacterial culture. Acid-fast isolates 
      were identified by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that discriminates 
      among members of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Histopathologic evaluations 
      were completed, and animals were tested for antibodies using a Johne's enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and agar gel immunodiffusion. In addition, 104 fecal 
      samples from tule elk remaining in the herd were collected from the ground and 
      submitted for radiometric mycobacterial culture. No gross lesions were detected in 
      any of the hunter-killed animals. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) 
      was cultured once from ileocecal tissue of one adult elk and was determined to be a 
      strain (A18) found commonly in infected cattle. One or more isolates of 
      Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (MAA) were isolated from tissues of five additional 
      adult elk. Gastrointestinal tract and lymph node tissues from 17 of the 37 elk (46%) 
      examined had histopathologic lesions commonly seen with mycobacterial infection; 
      however, acid-fast bacteria were not observed. All MAC infections were detected from 
      adult elk (P = 0.023). In adult elk, a statistically significant association was 
      found between MAA infection and ELISA sample-to-positive ratio (S/P) > or = 0.25 
      (P=0.021); four of five MAA culture-positive elk tested positive by ELISA. 
      Sensitivity and specificity of ELISA S/P > or = 0.25 for detection of MAA in adult 
      elk were 50% and 93%, respectively. No significant associations were found between 
      MAC infection and sex or histopathologic lesions. Bacteriologic culture confirmed 
      infection with MAP and MAA in this asymptomatic tule elk herd. The Johne's ELISA was 
      useful in signaling mycobacterial infection on a population basis but could not 
      discriminate between MAA and MAP antibodies. The multiplex PCR was useful in 
      discriminating among the closely related species belonging to MAC.

TI  - The diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis in an HIV-endemic setting and the use of 
      induced sputum.
PG  - 716-26
AB  - SETTING: A hospital in the capital city of Uganda. OBJECTIVES: To determine the 
      proportion of positive induced sputum cultures among probable childhood tuberculosis 
      (TB) cases, to describe the laboratory and radiological features of childhood TB in 
      the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and to determine the prevalence 
      of HIV infection in these patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive study. 
      METHOD: Seven hundred and fifty children with suspected TB were evaluated 
      clinically, by chest radiography and by tuberculin test (Mantoux). Probable cases 
      underwent sputum induction or lymph node biopsy, HIV testing and RNA-PCR tests. 
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The Mantoux test was positive in 55/121 (45%) of the 
      patients; low sensitivity to Mantoux was associated with HIV infection (P = 0.000). 
      Induced sputum yielded 12/101 (12%) positive smears of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      and 30/101 (30%) positive cultures. Six of the eight lymph node biopsies were 
      culture-positive, and the histology of seven samples was supportive of TB. Most of 
      the children with probable and confirmed TB presented with similar signs, symptoms 
      and chest radiography patterns, irrespective of HIV status. Elevated ESR had no 
      significant role in the diagnosis of TB in children and even more so in the presence 
      of HIV infection. The HIV infection rate was high among children with TB (49%).

      Mycobacterium bovis. In this study, the sensitivity of the gamma-interferon (IFN-γ) 
      assay using an antigen cocktail containing early secretory antigenic target-6kDa 
      (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) peptides for stimulation was 
      determined and compared with those obtained in single intradermal tuberculin (SIT) 
      and single intradermal cervical comparative tuberculin (SICCT) tests and IFN-γ assay 
      using purified protein derivative (PPD) in three different flocks infected with M. 
      caprae under different epidemiological conditions. Correlation between specific 
      IFN-γ production and severity of lesions was also evaluated. Sensitivities of the 
      diagnostic tests varied greatly in the three flocks studied, with higher values in 
      those where higher lesion scores were observed. The results show that IFN-γ assay 
      applied in goats using PPD or the ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides cocktail for stimulation 
      yielded similar sensitivity values. A significant yet weak positive correlation 
      between specific IFN-γ production and lesion scores was detected after the 
      stimulation with PPDs (p=0.004) whereas when the blood samples were stimulated with 
      ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides, the correlation was not significant (p>0.05). Therefore, 
      specific-IFN-γ production after the stimulation with PPDs or ESAT-6/CFP-10 was not 
      an accurate indicator of lesion severity in naturally tuberculosis infected goats 
      with M. caprae.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of FNA, Tb-PCR, and CBC as an 
      initial work-up protocol for cervical lymphadenopathy to reiterate the importance of 
      CBC in terms of predicting the clinical course. In this consecutive case series, 158 
      patients with cervical lymphadenopathy were enrolled. All patients underwent FNA and 
      CBC, with or without Tb-PCR. The validity of combined FNA ± Tb-PCR and CBC in the 
      diagnosis of diseases requiring definitive treatment was evaluated. Final diagnoses 
      were self-limiting disease in 110 (69.6%), malignancy in 19 (12.0%), and 
      tuberculosis in 26 (16.5%). Sensitivity of FNA ± Tb-PCR was 66.7% and of added CBC 
      profile was 97.9%. Patients with neutropenia or lymphocytosis were found to have a 
      higher chance of spontaneous recovery than patients with a normal WBC profile. FNA 
      and Tb-PCR were found to be important in patients aged more than 20. The results 
      indicate that FNA, Tb-PCR, and CBC are basic and essential in initial work-up for 
      cervical lymphadenopathy. In particular, CBC was found to aid in detecting critical 
      diseases and predicting the likelihood of open biopsy in patients with negative FNA 
      and Tb-PCR. Patient age was also found to be an important determinant of the work-up 
      protocol.

AB  - Sputum examination for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is not always 
      satisfactory. We examined peripheral blood with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
      Blood samples were collected from 8 consecutive patients with suspected pulmonary 
      tuberculosis and from 18 healthy controls, half of whom were tuberculin skin-test 
      positive. All 8 patients had evidence of circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA 
      in the lymphocyte fraction of peripheral blood, and positive sputum cultures 
      indicating active pulmonary tuberculosis. None of the healthy controls had positive 
      PCR results. This PCR technique may prove useful for the rapid diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis.

TI  - Comparison of two laboratory-developed PCR methods for the diagnosis of pulmonary 
      tuberculosis in Brazilian patients with and without HIV infection.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/1471-2466-11-15 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct smear examination with Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining for the 
      diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is cheap and easy to use, but its low 
      sensitivity is a major drawback, particularly in HIV seropositive patients. As such, 
      new tools for laboratory diagnosis are urgently needed to improve the case detection 
      rate, especially in regions with a high prevalence of TB and HIV. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate the performance of two in house PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): PCR 
      dot-blot methodology (PCR dot-blot) and PCR agarose gel electrophoresis (PCR-AG) for 
      the diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) in HIV seropositive and HIV 
      seronegative patients. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted (from May 2003 to 
      May 2004) in a TB/HIV reference hospital. Sputum specimens from 277 PTB suspects 
      were tested by Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear, Culture and in house PCR assays (PCR 
      dot-blot and PCR-AG) and their performances evaluated. Positive cultures combined 
      with the definition of clinical pulmonary TB were employed as the gold standard. 
      RESULTS: The overall prevalence of PTB was 46% (128/277); in HIV+, prevalence was 
      54.0% (40/74). The sensitivity and specificity of PCR dot-blot were 74% (CI 95%; 
      66.1%-81.2%) and 85% (CI 95%; 78.8%-90.3%); and of PCR-AG were 43% (CI 95%; 
      34.5%-51.6%) and 76% (CI 95%; 69.2%-82.8%), respectively. For HIV seropositive and 
      HIV seronegative samples, sensitivities of PCR dot-blot (72% vs 75%; p=0.46) and 
      PCR-AG (42% vs 43%; p=0.54) were similar. Among HIV seronegative patients and PTB 
      suspects, ROC analysis presented the following values for the AFB smear (0.837), 
      Culture (0.926), PCR dot-blot (0.801) and PCR-AG (0.599). In HIV seropositive 
      patients, these area values were (0.713), (0.900), (0.789) and (0.595), 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Results of this study demonstrate that the in house PCR 
      dot blot may be an improvement for ruling out PTB diagnosis in PTB suspects assisted 
      at hospitals with a high prevalence of TB/HIV.

AB  - A novel indirect immuno-polymerase chain reaction (I-PCR) assay was developed for 
      the detection of circulating anti-Ag85B (antigen 85B, Rv1886c), anti-ESAT-6 (early 
      secretory antigenic target-6, Rv3875) and anti-cord factor (trehalose 
      6,6'-dimycolate) antibodies from the sera samples of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) 
      and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) patients and the results were compared with 
      an analogous enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We covalently attached the 
      amino-modified reporter DNA to the dithiothreitol (DTT)-reduced anti-human IgG 
      antibody through a chemical linker succinimidyl 
      4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC). The detection of cocktail of 
      anti-Ag85B, anti-ESAT-6 and anti-cord factor antibodies was found to be superior to 
      the detection of individual antibodies. The sensitivities of 89.5% and 77.5% with 
      I-PCR and 70.8% and 65% with ELISA were observed in smear-positive and 
      smear-negative PTB cases, respectively with high specificity (90.9%). On the other 
      hand, a sensitivity of 77.5% with I-PCR and 65% with ELISA was observed in EBTB 
      cases. The detection of cocktail of antibodies by I-PCR is likely to improve the 
      utility of existing algorithms for TB diagnosis.

TI  - PE_PGRS antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis induce maturation and activation of 
      human dendritic cells.
PG  - 3495-504
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.0903299 [doi]
AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of pulmonary tuberculosis, infects 
      one-third of the world's population. Activation of host immune responses for 
      containment of mycobacterial infections involves participation of innate immune 
      cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are sentinels of the immune system and are 
      important for eliciting both primary and secondary immune responses to pathogens. In 
      this context, to understand the molecular pathogenesis of tuberculosis and host 
      response to mycobacteria and to conceive prospective vaccine candidates, it is 
      important to understand how cell wall Ags of M. tuberculosis and, in particular, the 
      proline-glutamic acid_polymorphic guanine-cytosine-rich sequence (PE_PGRS) family of 
      proteins modulate DC maturation and function. In this study, we demonstrate that two 
      cell wall-associated/secretory PE_PGRS proteins, PE_PGRS 17 (Rv0978c) and PE_PGRS 11 
      (Rv0754), recognize TLR2, induce maturation and activation of human DCs, and enhance 
      the ability of DCs to stimulate CD4(+) T cells. We further found that PE_PGRS 
      protein-mediated activation of DCs involves participation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and 
      NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Priming of human DCs with IFN-gamma further augmented 
      PE_PGRS 17 or PE_PGRS 11 Ag-induced DC maturation and secretion of key 
      proinflammatory cytokines. Our results suggest that by activating DCs, PE_PGRS 
      proteins, important mycobacterial cell wall Ags, could potentially contribute in the 
      initiation of innate immune responses during tuberculosis infection and hence 
      regulate the clinical course of tuberculosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our study investigated the association between single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in P2X7 gene and serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to 
      mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in TB patients. METHODS: A total of 103 TB patients 
      were enrolled as case group and 87 healthy individuals at same geographical region 
      as control group. The SNP detection of 1513A>C and -762T>C was performed using 
      PCR-RFLP, and the levels of serum IgG responses to MTB in all subjects were 
      determined. RESULTS: AC and CC of 1513A>C and TC and CC of -762T>C had higher 
      frequencies in case group than in control group. TB patients carrying TC and CC of 
      -762T>C had higher positive rate of IgG responses to MTB than those carrying TT. 
      Additionally, patients carrying TC and CC of -762T>C had more MTB in sputum than 
      those carrying TT. CONCLUSION: P2X7 SNPs, 1513A>C and -762T>C, may be associated 
      with the susceptibility to tuberculosis, and -762T>C SNP may contribute to the 
      development of MTB. The mutant genotype of -762T>C (TC and CC) may lower human 
      capability of phagocytosis to MTB, leading to an increased morbidity of TB.

TI  - Rapid diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteremia by PCR.
PG  - 512-5
AB  - A method based on DNA amplification and hybridization has been used for the rapid 
      detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in blood samples from 38 hospitalized 
      patients (15 human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] positive and 23 HIV negative) in 
      whom localized or disseminated forms of tuberculosis were suspected. In 32 of these 
      patients, the diagnosis of tuberculosis was eventually confirmed by conventional 
      bacteriological or histological procedures. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected with 
      the PCR technique in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 9 of 11 (82%) 
      HIV-infected patients and in 7 of 21 (33%) HIV-negative patients (P < 0.01), while 
      M. tuberculosis blood cultures were positive in 1 of 8 (12.5%) and 1 of 18 (5.5%) 
      patients, respectively. PCR was positive in all cases with disseminated disease in 
      both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients and also in the HIV-positive patients 
      with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Seven samples from patients with documented 
      illness other than tuberculosis and 12 specimens from healthy volunteers, including 
      seven volunteers with a recent positive purified protein derivative test, were used 
      as controls and had a negative PCR. These results suggest that detection of M. 
      tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may be a useful tool for 
      rapid diagnosis of disseminated and extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis, especially 
      in an HIV-positive population.

      inflammatory syndrome.
PG  - 369-77
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201201-0094OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: HIV-tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
      (TB-IRIS) is an immunopathological reaction to mycobacterial antigens induced by 
      antiretroviral therapy. Prednisone reduces morbidity in TB-IRIS, but the mechanisms 
      are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of prednisone on the inflammatory 
      response in TB-IRIS (antigen-specific effector T cells, cytokines, and chemokines). 
      METHODS: Blood was taken from participants in a randomized placebo-controlled trial 
      of prednisone for TB-IRIS, at 0, 2, and 4 weeks. Participants received prednisone at 
      a dosage of 1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks followed by 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, or 
      placebo at identical dosages. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Analyses included IFN-γ 
      enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
      on peripheral blood mononuclear cells after restimulation with heat-killed 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Luminex multiplex cytokine analysis of corresponding 
      tissue culture supernatants, and Luminex multiplex cytokine analysis of serum. 
      Fifty-eight participants with TB-IRIS (31 receiving prednisone, 27 receiving 
      placebo) were included. In serum, significant decreases in IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, 
      tumor necrosis factor-α, IFN-γ, and IFN-γ-induced protein-10 concentrations during 
      prednisone, but not placebo, treatment were observed. No differences in ELISPOT 
      responses comparing prednisone and placebo groups were shown in response to ESAT-6 
      (early secreted antigen target-6), Acr1, Acr2, 38-kD antigen, or heat-killed H37Rv 
      M. tuberculosis. Purified protein derivative ELISPOT responses increased over 4 
      weeks in the prednisone group and decreased in the placebo group (P = 0.007). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of prednisone in TB-IRIS appear to be mediated 
      via suppression of predominantly proinflammatory cytokine responses of innate immune 
      origin, not via a reduction of the numbers of antigen-specific T cells in peripheral 
      blood.

      Infection.

AB  - MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells have been implicated in host defense against 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. However, the relative contribution of 
      various MHC Ib-restricted T cell populations to anti-mycobacterial immunity remains 
      elusive. In this study, we used mice that lack MHC Ia (Kb-/-Db-/-), MHC Ia/H2-M3 
      (Kb-/-Db-/-M3-/-), or β2m (β2m-/-) to study the role of M3-restricted and other MHC 
      Ib-restricted T cells in immunity against Mtb. Unlike their dominant role in 
      Listeria infection, we found that M3-restricted CD8+ T cells only represented a 
      small proportion of the CD8+ T cells responding to Mtb infection. Non-M3, MHC 
      Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells expanded preferentially in the lungs of Mtb-infected 
      Kb-/-Db-/-M3-/- mice, exhibited polyfunctional capacities and conferred protection 
      against Mtb. These MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells recognized several Mtb-derived 
      protein antigens at a higher frequency than MHC Ia-restricted CD8+ T cells. The 
      presentation of Mtb antigens to MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells was mostly 
      β2m-dependent but TAP-independent. Interestingly, a large proportion of Mtb-specific 
      MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells in Kb-/-Db-/-M3-/- mice were Qa-2-restricted while no 
      considerable numbers of MR1 or CD1-restricted Mtb-specific CD8+ T cells were 
      detected. Our findings indicate that nonclassical CD8+ T cells other than the known 
      M3, CD1, and MR1-restricted CD8+ T cells contribute to host immune responses against 
      Mtb infection. Targeting these MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells would facilitate the 
      design of better Mtb vaccines with broader coverage across MHC haplotypes due to the 
      limited polymorphism of MHC class Ib molecules.

AB  - The present study analysed the concordance among four different molecular diagnostic 
      methods for tuberculosis (TB) in pulmonary and blood samples from immunocompromised 
      patients. A total of 165 blood and 194 sputum samples were collected from 181 human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with upper respiratory complaints, 
      regardless of suspicious for TB. The samples were submitted for smear microscopy, 
      culture and molecular tests: a laboratory-developed conventional polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the Gen-Probe and Detect-TB 
      Ampligenix kits. The samples were handled blindly by all the technicians involved, 
      from sample processing to results analysis. For sputum, the sensitivity and 
      specificity were 100% and 96.7% for qPCR, 81.8% and 94.5% for Gen-Probe and 100% and 
      66.3% for Detect-TB, respectively. qPCR presented the best concordance with sputum 
      culture [kappa (k) = 0.864)], followed by Gen-Probe (k = 0.682). For blood samples, 
      qPCR showed 100% sensitivity and 92.3% specificity, with a substantial correlation 
      with sputum culture (k = 0.754) and with the qPCR results obtained from sputum of 
      the corresponding patient (k = 0.630). Conventional PCR demonstrated the worst 
      results for sputa and blood, with a sensitivity of 100% vs. 88.9% and a specificity 
      of 46.3% vs. 32%, respectively. Commercial or laboratory-developed molecular assays 
      can overcome the difficulties in the diagnosis of TB in paucibacillary patients 
      using conventional methods available in most laboratories.

AB  - Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) is critical for host control of M. tuberculosis, but 
      the relative contribution of TNF from innate and adaptive immune responses during 
      tuberculosis infection is unclear. Myeloid versus T-cell-derived TNF function in 
      tuberculosis was investigated using cell type-specific TNF deletion. Mice deficient 
      for TNF expression in macrophages/neutrophils displayed early, transient 
      susceptibility to M. tuberculosis but recruited activated, TNF-producing CD4(+) and 
      CD8(+) T-cells and controlled chronic infection. Strikingly, deficient TNF 
      expression in T-cells resulted in early control but susceptibility and eventual 
      mortality during chronic infection with increased pulmonary pathology. TNF 
      inactivation in both myeloid and T-cells rendered mice critically susceptible to 
      infection with a phenotype resembling complete TNF deficient mice, indicating that 
      myeloid and T-cells are the primary TNF sources collaborating for host control of 
      tuberculosis. Thus, while TNF from myeloid cells mediates early immune function, 
      T-cell derived TNF is essential to sustain protection during chronic tuberculosis 
      infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biomarkers predicting tuberculosis treatment response and cure would 
      facilitate drug development. This study investigated expression patterns of the 
      co-stimulation molecule NKG2D in human tuberculosis and treatment to determine its 
      potential usefulness as a host biomarker of tuberculosis drug efficacy. METHODS: 
      Tuberculosis patients (n = 26) were recruited in Lahore, Pakistan, at diagnosis and 
      followed up during treatment. Household contacts (n = 24) were also recruited. NKG2D 
      expression was measured by qRT-PCR in RNA samples both ex vivo and following 
      overnight mycobacterial stimulation in vitro. Protein expression of NKG2D and 
      granzyme B was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: NKG2D expression in newly 
      diagnosed tuberculosis patients was similar to household contacts in ex vivo RNA, 
      but was higher following in vitro stimulation. The NKG2D expression was dramatically 
      reduced by intensive phase chemotherapy, in both ex vivo blood RNA and CD8(+) T cell 
      protein expression, but then reverted to higher levels after the continuation phase 
      in successfully treated patients. CONCLUSION: The changes in NKG2D expression 
      through successful treatment reflect modulation of the peripheral cytotoxic T cell 
      response. This likely reflects firstly in vivo stimulation by live Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis, followed by the response to dead bacilli, antigen-release and finally 
      immunopathology resolution. Such changes in host peripheral gene expression, 
      alongside clinical and microbiological indices, could be developed into a 
      biosignature of tuberculosis drug-induced cure to be used in future clinical trials.

TI  - Transcriptional profiling of innate and adaptive human immune responses to 
      mycobacteria in the tuberculin skin test.
PG  - 3253-60
LID - 10.1002/eji.201141841 [doi]
AB  - The tuberculin skin test (TST) is a model of integrated innate and adaptive human 
      immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the component processes that are 
      involved in this model have not previously been defined in vivo. We used 
      transcriptional profiling to study these responses within the TST at molecular and 
      system levels. Skin biopsies from TST injection sites were examined in subjects 
      classified as TST(+) or TST(-) by clinical and histological criteria. Genome-wide 
      expression arrays showed evolution of immune responses reflecting T-cell activation 
      and recruitment with uniquely Th1-polarized responses and cytotoxic T cells (CTLs). 
      In addition, distinct innate immune and IFN-γ-stimulated gene expression signatures 
      were identified, under the regulation of NF-κB and STAT1 transcriptional control. 
      These were highly enriched for chemokines and MHC class II molecules providing a 
      potential mechanism for paracrine amplification of inflammatory responses in the 
      TST, by supporting cellular recruitment and enhancing antigen presentation. The same 
      repertoire of innate and adaptive immune responses was evident in TST(+) and TST(-) 
      subjects alike, clinically positive TSTs being distinguished only by quantitatively 
      greater differences. These data provide new insights into complex multifaceted 
      responses within the TST, with much greater sensitivity than previous clinical or 
      histological assessments.

TI  - Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical samples by using polymerase 
      chain reaction and a nonradioactive detection system.
PG  - 2567-75
AB  - A test based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed for the detection 
      of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in clinical samples. In this test, a 
      245-bp sequence of the insertion element IS986 was amplified and detected by agarose 
      gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide and by Southern blot and dot 
      blot hybridization by using a 188-bp digoxigenin-labeled probe. We tested clinical 
      specimens from 227 patients suspected of having tuberculosis. These included 102 
      cerebrospinal fluid, 48 sputum, 18 pleural fluid, 5 bronchoalveolar lavage, 18 
      blood, 7 pus, 8 bone marrow, and 6 urine samples and 15 tissue biopsy specimens. We 
      also tested sputum samples from 75 patients with diseases other than tuberculosis. 
      Sputum samples were first decontaminated, and all samples were treated with 
      proteinase K-detergent solution to extract the DNA. Part of each sample was spiked 
      with M. tuberculosis to provide a semiquantitative assay and to control for the loss 
      of mycobacteria or interference with the PCR which may cause false-negative results. 
      One femtogram of M. tuberculosis DNA could be detected. PCR was positive for all 32 
      culture-positive (for M. tuberculosis) and Ziehl-Neelsen staining (ZN)-positive 
      samples, 10 of 12 culture-positive and ZN-negative samples, and all 4 
      culture-negative and ZN-positive samples. PCR detected M. tuberculosis complex 
      bacteria in 35 of 178 culture- and ZN-negative samples. Clinical data supported the 
      diagnosis of tuberculosis in the majority of the 35 patients from whom those samples 
      were obtained.

TI  - CCL5 participates in early protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PG  - 1153-65
LID - 10.1189/jlb.1109742 [doi]
AB  - Control of M.tb, the causative agent of TB, requires immune cell recruitment to form 
      lung granulomas. The chemokines and chemokine receptors that promote cell migration 
      for granuloma formation, however, are not defined completely. As immunity to M.tb 
      manifests slowly in the lungs, a better understanding of specific roles for 
      chemokines, in particular those that promote M.tb-protective T(H)1 responses, may 
      identify targets that could accelerate granuloma formation. The chemokine CCL5 has 
      been detected in patients with TB and implicated in control of M.tb infection. To 
      define a role for CCL5 in vivo during M.tb infection, CCL5 KO mice were infected 
      with a low dose of aerosolized M.tb. During early M.tb infection, CCL5 KO mice 
      localized fewer APCs and chemokine receptor-positive T cells to the lungs and had 
      microscopic evidence of altered cell trafficking to M.tb granulomas. Early acquired 
      immunity and granuloma function were transiently impaired when CCL5 was absent, 
      evident by delayed IFN-gamma responses and poor control of M.tb growth. Lung cells 
      from M.tb-infected CCL5 KO mice eventually reached or exceeded the levels of WT 
      mice, likely as a result of partial compensation by the CCL5-related ligand, CCL4, 
      and not because of CCL3. Finally, our results suggest that most T cells use CCR5 but 
      not CCR1 to interact with these ligands. Overall, these results contribute to a 
      model of M.tb granuloma formation dependent on temporal regulation of chemokines 
      rather than on redundant or promiscuous interactions.

TI  - Molecular methods in the detection and identification of mycobacterial infections.
PG  - 1002-6
AB  - Nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests for direct detection of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis complex in respiratory specimens have the potential to provide a more 
      rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) than is currently possible by 
      conventional stain, culture, and identification tests. Currently, 2 NAA 
      tests-enhanced Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct (MTD) Test (Gen-Probe, 
      Inc) and Amplicor Mycobacterium tuberculosis Test (Roche Molecular Systems, 
      Inc)-have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for testing respiratory 
      specimens that are smear positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). This restriction to 
      AFB smear-positive specimens was based on data from the initial clinical trials 
      conducted to evaluate these products that showed low sensitivity (ie, 48%-53%) and 
      less-than-optimal specificity (ie, 96%-99%) in AFB smear-negative specimens. Data 
      from the clinical trial for the enhanced MTD test and from 2 subsequent studies, 
      however, suggest that this version of the MTD test is a reliable tool for rapid 
      diagnosis of pulmonary TB, regardless of the AFB smear result. Both NAA tests have 
      been evaluated for diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB, and results were comparable to 
      the results of tests performed with respiratory specimens. The NAA tests also appear 
      to be reliable for rapid identification of M tuberculosis complex in positive broth 
      cultures of all specimen types except blood. The impact of the NAA tests on patient 
      outcome varies based on the AFB smear result. With smear-positive results, public 
      health and hospital infection control resources are predominantly affected. With 
      smear-negative results, however, the potential for affecting patient outcome is much 
      greater. In patients with smear-negative results, the NAA test can result in earlier 
      diagnosis of TB and subsequent initiation of therapy. Use of these tests also may 
      eliminate the need for invasive diagnostic procedures, which are costly and pose an 
      added risk to the patient, and they may allow earlier discharge of hospitalized 
      patients.

TI  - Role of the interleukin 10 family of cytokines in patients with immune 
      reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated with HIV infection and tuberculosis.
PG  - 1148-56
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jit002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The interleukin 10 (IL-10) family comprises cytokines structurally 
      related to IL-10 that share signaling receptors that have conserved signaling 
      cascades. The immunopathogenesis of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome 
      (IRIS) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and 
      tuberculosis remains incompletely understood. We hypothesized that a deficiency of 
      IL-10 and its homologs may contribute to the immunopathology of IRIS in these 
      patients. METHODS: We performed a case-control analysis involving patients with HIV 
      infection and tuberculosis who had IRIS at clinical presentation (tuberculosis-IRIS) 
      and similar patients with HIV infection and tuberculosis who did not develop 
      tuberculosis-IRIS (non-IRIS). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were 
      cultured in the presence or absence of heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 6 
      and 24 hours. Messenger RNA was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription 
      polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cytokine concentrations in serum were also 
      determined. RESULTS: Cultures of PBMCs stimulated with M. tuberculosis for 24 hours 
      yielded higher IL-10 and interleukin 22 (IL-22) transcript levels for 
      tuberculosis-IRIS patients, compared with non-IRIS patients. Analysis of 
      corresponding serum samples showed significantly higher concentrations of IL-10 and 
      IL-22 in tuberculosis-IRIS patients, compared with non-IRIS patients. CONCLUSIONS: 
      IL-10 and IL-22 were differentially induced in PBMCs from tuberculosis-IRIS patients 
      after in vitro stimulation, and higher concentrations of their corresponding 
      proteins were detected in serum (in vivo). The higher levels of IL-10 observed in 
      this study may represent a compensatory antiinflammatory response during 
      tuberculosis-IRIS. The elevated levels of IL-22 suggest an association between this 
      cytokine and immunopathology during tuberculosis-IRIS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of different methods for an initial treatment decision in 
      individuals with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. BACKGROUND: Recently, important 
      advances regarding the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis have been introduced, 
      which influence the decision to initiate anti-tuberculosis treatment. METHODS: To 
      evaluate the impact of different methods for the presumed diagnosis of tuberculosis, 
      individuals with suspected tuberculosis were prospectively enrolled following a 
      specific algorithm including initial smear microscopy and Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis-specific nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) from sputum. In cases of 
      negative initial test results, tuberculin skin testing, bronchoscopy with 
      transbronchial biopsies and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) in peripheral blood 
      and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were performed. RESULTS: Amongst 135 
      individuals with suspected tuberculosis, 42 had tuberculosis, 10 had nontuberculous 
      mycobacteria pulmonary infection/colonization (one had both tuberculosis and 
      nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary infection/colonization) and 84 had an 
      alternative final diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity were 41% and 99% 
      [positive likelihood ratio (LR+) = 40] for sputum microscopy and 31% and 98% (LR+) = 
      16) for BAL nucleic acid amplification, respectively. In patients with acid-fast 
      bacilli smear-negative tuberculosis (25/42, 59.5%), M. tuberculosis-specific BAL 
      fluid IGRA was 92% sensitive and 87% specific (LR+) = 7) for the diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: None of the microbiological or immunological methods that 
      aim to provide a rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis whilst waiting the confirmation of 
      the M. tuberculosis culture results is on its own accurate enough to diagnose or 
      exclude pulmonary tuberculosis. Negative sputum microscopy and M. 
      tuberculosis-specific NAAT results should prompt bronchoscopy including BAL for M. 
      tuberculosis-specific IGRA in individuals with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is a highly lethal infectious disease and 
      early diagnosis of TB is critical for the control of disease progression. The 
      objective of this study was to profile a panel of serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as 
      potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of pulmonary TB infection. METHODS: 
      Using TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) analysis followed by quantitative reverse 
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validation, expression levels of 
      miRNAs in serum samples from 30 patients with active tuberculosis and 60 patients 
      with Bordetella pertussis (BP), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and enterovirus (EV) 
      were analyzed. RESULTS: The Low-Density Array data showed that 97 miRNAs were 
      differentially expressed in pulmonary TB patient sera compared with healthy controls 
      (90 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated). Following qRT-PCR confirmation and receiver 
      operational curve (ROC) analysis, three miRNAs (miR-361-5p, miR-889 and miR-576-3p) 
      were shown to distinguish TB infected patients from healthy controls and other 
      microbial infections with moderate sensitivity and specificity (area under curve 
      (AUC) value range, 0.711-0.848). Multiple logistic regression analysis of a 
      combination of these three miRNAs showed an enhanced ability to discriminate between 
      these two groups with an AUC value of 0.863. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that 
      altered levels of serum miRNAs have great potential to serve as non-invasive 
      biomarkers for early detection of pulmonary TB infection.

AB  - A 4-year-old neutered female crossbred Shepherd was referred for a history of 10 
      days of anorexia, polyuria, polydipsia, polyadenomegaly, and diarrhea. On physical 
      examination, the dog appeared quiet, responsive, and apyretic, with generalized and 
      severe lymphadenomegaly. Hematologic abnormalities included neutrophilic 
      leukocytosis with left shift, and lymphopenia. Blood smears revealed 
      intracytoplasmic bacilli negatively stained with May-Grünwald-Giemsa in neutrophils 
      and monocytes. Lymph node smears revealed pyogranulomatous adenitis with calcified 
      deposits and many negative-staining rod structures, both within the cytoplasm of 
      neutrophils and macrophages, and free in the background. An acid-fast stain 
      (Ziehl-Neelsen) confirmed the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection. The dog was 
      euthanized for public health and ethical reasons, and the postmortem examination 
      revealed severe and generalized granulomatous and necrotizing lymphadenitis, 
      panniculitis, and hepatitis, and infiltration of epithelioid macrophages in the 
      lungs, colon, and spleen. Numerous acid-fast bacilli, consistent with mycobacterial 
      infection, were observed both in the cytoplasm of epithelioid macrophages and giant 
      cells, and free in the background. Mycobacterium bovis was first confirmed by 
      conventional PCR of organ extracts. Mycobacterium avium was detected in a culture of 
      the same organs. Further PCR amplifications and sequencing revealed a coinfection 
      with 2 different species of mycobacterium, one belonging to the Mycobacterium avium 
      complex and the other to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.

TI  - Diagnosis of Mycobacterium bovis infection in calves sensitized by mycobacteria of 
      the avium/intracellulare group.
PG  - 89-96
AB  - Because of the frequent exposure of cattle to mycobacteria of the 
      avium/intracellulare group, an investigation was carried out into the possible 
      repercussions thereof on the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. Three calves from a 
      bovine tuberculosis-free herd, scored avian reactors in the gamma-interferon assay 
      for bovine tuberculosis, were sedated and inoculated endotracheally with a virulent 
      Mycobacterium bovis strain. Then, three other avian reactors were housed with the 
      above donor calves. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the nasal swabs of the 
      three endotracheally infected, donor calves. On these samples, TB complex-specific 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for IS6110 were also positive, albeit with a 
      different time kinetics. The three contact-infected calves showed clear 
      immunological signs of infection; however, their nasal swabs were always 
      PCR-negative and only Mycobacterium avium was isolated. In the endotracheally 
      infected donor calves there was a rise of the gamma-interferon responses to avian 
      and bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculins, which reached the same 
      stable plateau levels over the whole experiment. The above effect was also observed 
      in the contact-infected calves, even though the response to avian PPD tuberculin 
      always remained at a higher level. By using conventional bovine and avian PPD 
      tuberculins, the comparative intradermal test was generally positive in 
      endotracheally infected, as opposed to contact-infected calves; a positive 
      intradermal test for M. bovis was obtained in two contact-infected calves by 
      different bovine PPD tuberculins based on M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) 
      secreted or somatic antigens. It was concluded that M. bovis infection may be 
      concealed for some time in cattle sensitized by mycobacteria of the 
      avium/intracellulare group and that different diagnostic procedures should be 
      adopted for such animals.

TI  - Efficient mycobacterial DNA extraction from clinical samples for early diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 847-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      in clinical samples requires the use of an extraction method that can efficiently 
      lyse mycobacterial cells and recover small amounts of DNA. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 
      the use of a benzyl-alcohol guanidine hydrochloride (DNA extraction) method (GuHClM) 
      on blood samples. DESIGN: GuHClM was evaluated in quantitatively spiked blood 
      samples with M. tuberculosis. We assessed the insertion sequence (IS) 6110 region of 
      M. tuberculosis to evaluate the efficacy of the method. The method was also applied 
      on 102 clinical samples of suspected tuberculosis (TB) individuals and compared with 
      smear microscopy of sputum specimens and the results of cultures. RESULTS: This 
      method reproducibly detected as low as 4-6 bacilli. Of 102 clinical samples, 84 were 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative, while 18 were HIV-positive. Among the 
      HIV-negative individuals, 58.3% were TB-positive using PCR, while respectively 47.6% 
      and 45.2% were sputum- and culture-positive. Among the HIV-positive individuals, 
      55.6% were PCR-positive, whereas only 38.9% were sputum-positive and 50% were 
      culture-positive. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the identification of 
      mycobacteria by PCR using GuHClM is very sensitive and therefore may have wide 
      utility in the diagnosis of TB.

TI  - Multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complexes and other Mycobacterial species directly 
      from clinical specimens.
PG  - 425-35

AB  - AIMS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most rapid and sensitive method for 
      diagnosing mycobacterial infections and identifying the aetiological Mycobacterial 
      species in order to administer the appropriate therapy and for better patient 
      management. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-five samples from 145 
      clinically suspected cases of tuberculosis were processed for the detection of 
      Mycobacterial infections by ZN (Ziehl Neelsen) smear examination, L-J & BACTEC 
      MGIT-960 culture and multiplex PCR tests. The multiplex PCR comprised of 
      genus-specific primers targeting hsp65 gene, Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      complex-specific primer targeting cfp10 (Rv3875, esxB) region and Mycobacterium 
      avium complex-specific primer pairs targeting 16S-23S Internal Transcribed Spacer 
      sequences. The multiplex PCR developed had an analytical sensitivity of 10 fg (3-4 
      cells) of mycobacterial DNA. The multiplex PCR test showed the highest (77.24%) 
      detection rate, while ZN smear examination had the lowest (20%) detection rate, 
      which was bettered by L-J culture (34.4%) and BACTEC MGIT-960 culture (50.34%) 
      methods. The mean isolation time for M. tuberculosis was 19.03 days in L-J culture 
      and 8.7 days in BACTEC MGIT-960 culture. Using the multiplex PCR, we could establish 
      M. tuberculosis + M. avium co-infection in 1.3% HIV-negative and 2.9% HIV-positive 
      patients. The multiplex PCR was also highly useful in diagnosing mycobacteraemia in 
      38.09% HIV-positive and 15.38% HIV-negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: The developed 
      in-house multiplex PCR could identify and differentiate the M. tuberculosis and M. 
      avium complexes from other Mycobacterial species directly from clinical specimens. 
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The triplex PCR developed by us could be used 
      to detect and differentiate M. tuberculosis, M. avium and other mycobacteria in a 
      single reaction tube.

AB  - One third of the world's population is latently infected with Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (Mtb) and up to 10% of infected individuals develop active tuberculosis 
      (TB) in their lifetime. Among the major challenges in the control of TB is the 
      implementation of sensitive methods for detection of latent tuberculosis infection 
      (LTBI). Currently, in vitro interferon gamma release assays, yielding single value 
      readout, are used as an alternative to the traditional tuberculin skin test for the 
      diagnosis of LTBI. More complex characterization of immune status of LTBI 
      individuals, however, is desirable for indication of LTBI subjects for preventative 
      chemotherapy. Here we describe a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 
      determination of expression levels of 14 genes, additional to interferon gamma, 
      which was applied for comparison of the specific Mtb-antigen immune response of 
      blood cells from healthy, latently infected, and TB individuals. With the use of 
      principal component analysis and discriminant analysis, a pattern of mRNA levels of 
      6 genes was identified, allowing discrimination of healthy individuals from active 
      TB and LTBI subjects. These results open the way to development of multimarker qPCR 
      for the detection of LTBI.

TI  - Haematogenous dissemination of tuberculous lymphadenitis.
PG  - 3-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection spreads through 
      the blood to different lymph-node groups in patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis. 
      DESIGN: Prospective analytical study. SETTING: The patients were recruited, managed 
      and followed at the lymphodenopathy clinic, Central Police Hospital, Burr, Khartoum, 
      Sudan. SUBJECTS: Fifty two sequential patients were enrolled. Thirty patients with 
      FNAC diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis and positive PCR for M. tuberculosis 
      complex had a mean age of 26.9 +/- 11.2 years and similar male, female affection. 
      Nine patients with FNAC tuberculous lymphadenitis, but negative PCR had a slightly 
      higher mean age (32.6 +/- 18.2 years) with similar male: female proportions. 
      Patients with reactive lymphadenopathy (9/52) were older than patients with 
      tuberculous lymphadenitis with a mean age of 45 +/- 24.6 years. RESULTS: None of the 
      patients were positive for HIV or had clinical or radiological evidence of pulmonary 
      tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected in the blood samples of 30/39 (77%) 
      patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis, but in none of the cases with reactive or 
      malignant lymphadenopathy. The presence of M. tuberculosis DNA correlated strongly 
      to multiple lymph-node involvement [OR (odds ratio) = 96.7, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 9.0 - 1,039] and to caseating-granulomatous and predominantly necrotic 
      cytomorphological categories [OR = 70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.0 - 703]. 
      CONCLUSION: M. tuberculosis most probably disseminates through the blood from one 
      node group to the other in patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis.

TI  - Fluorescence polarization assay for the detection of antibodies to Mycobacterium

PG  - 113-21
AB  - The performance of a fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) that detects antibodies 
      to Mycobacterium bovis in bovine sera is described. The FPA reported here is a 
      direct binding primary screening assay using a small polypeptide derived from the M. 
      bovis MPB70 protein. A secondary inhibition assay confirms suspect or presumed 
      positive samples. Specificity studies involved five different veterinary 
      laboratories testing 4461 presumed negative bovine samples. FPA specificity was 
      99.9%. The FPA was used to identify herd status as either M. bovis infected or 
      non-infected. Herd surveillance studies (nine herds) were performed in Mexico and 
      South Africa. The FPA had a specificity of 100% (two negative herds), and correctly 
      identified six of seven infected herds. Finally, sera from 105 slaughter animals 
      that had gross lesions in lymph nodes similar to those seen with bovine tuberculosis 
      were tested by the FPA. Thin sections from the associated formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded samples of lymph nodes were stained using hematoxylin and eosin 
      (H&E) for morphologic examination and using the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) method for 
      detection of acid-fast bacilli. Of the 105 animals, 78 were classified as TB suspect 
      based on lesion morphology, 21 were positive by ZN, 9 were positive by FPA and 13 
      were positive by PCR for the tuberculosis group of Mycobacterium. Among the 21 ZN 
      positives, 11 (52.4%) were PCR positive. Among the 9 FPA positives, 8 (88.9%) were 
      PCR positive. For the 13 PCR positives, 8 (61.5%) were FPA positive and 11 (84.6%) 
      were ZN positives. These results show that use of the FPA for detection of M. bovis 
      infection of cattle has value for bovine disease surveillance programs.

      determine the specific miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of ATB. The expression 
      profile of miRNA under PPD challenge was first measured using microarray analysis in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from ATB patients and healthy controls 
      (HC). The remarkably reactive miRNAs were then validated in a larger cohort by 
      quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the diagnostic value of the 
      determined PPD-responsive miRNAs. The potential targets for those miRNAs were also 
      predicted by computational programs. Fourteen of 866 human miRNAs exhibited at least 
      1.8-fold difference in the ratio of expression level before and after stimulation 
      with PPD between the ATB and HC groups. The qRT-PCR study validated the findings 
      from microarray-based screening, in which miR-155 exhibited a fold change of 1.4 in 
      the HC group and 3.7 in the ATB group upon PPD stimulation (p < 0.0001); miR-155* 
      exhibited a fold change of 1.9 in the HC and 4.6 in the ATB group (p < 0.005). In 
      ROC plots, the area under the curve was 0.8972 for miR-155 and 0.7945 for miR-155*. 
      The background expression of these 2 microRNAs exhibited no differences between the 
      ATB and HC groups. miR-155 and miR-155* exhibited characteristic expression by 
      TB-specific antigen, suggesting that they can be potential diagnostic markers under 
      the challenge of specific MTB antigens.

TI  - [Recent biological techniques for the diagnosis of mycobacterial infections].
PG  - 665-70
AB  - More rapid and more sensitive techniques have replaced traditional methods of direct 
      examination and culturing for diagnosing mycobacterial infections. Among the most 
      recent methods are Isolator blood culture, radiometric detection, hybridization and 
      amplification, each with its advantages and disadvantages. The Isolator blood 
      culture system improves the sensitivity of mycobacteria detection, especially for 
      Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare. In terms of cost and culture time, this system 
      is similar to traditional methods, although it is limited to blood cultures. 
      Radiometric detection, associated with culture in a liquid medium, greatly improves 
      diagnostic power. The main advantage lies in the reduced delay before detection, 
      13.4 days compared with 21.7 days on solid media (for M. tuberculosis) and 5.1 days 
      instead of 18.6 days for other mycobacteria. A culture is considered to be negative 
      after 6 weeks without growth compared with 12 weeks for the Löwenstein-Jensen 
      medium. The disadvantages of this system include the cost of equipment, personnel 
      and radio-active products. In addition, as for all culture methods, a sufficient 
      bacterial population is required in the sample. Hybridization techniques rely on DNA 
      or RNA probes which recognize mycobacterial sequences. The Gen-Probe recognizes M. 
      tuberculosis, M. avium, M. intracellulare and M. gordonae ribosomal RNA. Syngene 
      probes recognize M. tuberculosis and M. avium-intracellulare DNA sequences. Rapid 
      identification in less than 2 hours is a major advantage. At the present time 50 pg 
      of DNA are required, a quantity which is not usually present in clinical samples. 
      Combining this technique with primary culture in liquid medium or amplification 
      techniques improves sensitivity. Polymerase chain reaction amplifies a specific 
      sequence of double strand DNA. This method provides a means of identifying 
      mycobacterial DNA in a clinical sample within 24-48 hours, a major improvement over 
      traditional culture. Cost however may be a barrier although the cost/benefit ration 
      remains to be determined.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic utility of interferon-γ release assay 
      (T-SPOT.TB) for the differential diagnosis between Crohn's disease (CD) and 
      intestinal tuberculosis (ITB). METHODS: A total of 103 CD and 88 ITB patients, 
      confirmed by histology and anti-tuberculosis treatment response from 2003 to 2011, 
      were included. Their characteristics and clinical features were recorded. 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of IS6110, in vitro 
      T-SPOT.TB, tuberculin skin test (TST), immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to MTB 
      (protein chip), serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA IgG, chronic 
      inflammatory bowel disease profile) and acid-fast staining of biopsied colonic 
      tissue specimens were performed. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine 
      their concordance with the diagnosis and its sensitivity, specificity, positive 
      (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: Abnormal pulmonary X-ray, 
      ascites and lesions of both cecum and ascending colon were more associated with ITB, 
      while intestinal surgery and lesions of both ileum and adjacent colon were more 
      commonly seen in CD. Significant diagnostic concordance was found using T-SPOT.TB (κ 
      = 0.786) by consistency test. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of T-SPOT.TB 
      were 86%, 93%, 88% and 91%, respectively, and the sensitivity and NPV were 
      significantly higher than other examinations (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: T-SPOT.TB is a 
      valuable assay in differentiating ITB from CD, particularly in the diagnostic 
      exclusion of ITB based on its high specificity and NPV.

TI  - Ante mortem diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle: a review of the tuberculin tests, 
      gamma-interferon assay and other ancillary diagnostic techniques.
PG  - 190-210
AB  - The early, preclinical stages of bovine TB can be detected in live animals by the 
      use of tests of cellular immunity (the skin, gamma-interferon and lymphocyte 
      transformation tests). Tests of humoral (antibody) immunity, Mycobacterium bovis PCR 
      probes on early tissue cultures or live cattle specimens, and tests based on 
      "electronic nose" technology have been developed more recently. The key measure of 
      diagnostic test accuracy is the relationship between sensitivity and specificity, 
      which determines the false-positive and false-negative proportions. None of the 
      tests currently available for the diagnosis of bovine TB allow a perfectly accurate 
      determination of the M. bovis infection status of cattle. Although various factors 
      can reduce the sensitivity and specificity of the skin tests, these remain the 
      primary ante mortem diagnostic tools for TB in cattle, providing a cost-effective 
      and reliable means of screening entire cattle populations. Despite the inescapable 
      limitations of existing diagnostic tests, bovine TB has been effectively eradicated 
      from many developed countries and regions with the implementation of sound 
      programmes of regular tuberculin skin testing and removal of reactors, coupled with 
      slaughterhouse surveillance for undetected infections, repeat testing and culling of 
      infected herds, cattle movement restrictions to prevent introduction of infected 
      animals and occasional slaughter of entire herds with intractable breakdowns. This 
      is likely to remain the mainstay of bovine TB control programmes for the foreseeable 
      future. Additionally, newer ancillary in vitro diagnostic assays are now available 
      to TB control programme managers to supplement the skin tests in defined 
      circumstances according to the specific disease situation in each country or region. 
      The strategic deployment of ancillary in vitro tests alongside the primary skin 
      tests has enhanced the detection of M. bovis-infected cattle and reduced the number 
      of animals slaughtered as false positives.

TI  - Contemporary approaches to the serology of tuberculosis.
PG  - 59-62
AB  - The current approaches in serological methods for the diagnosis of tuberculosis have 
      been towards the use of M. tuberculosis-specific antigens or epitopes of protein 
      antigens. Although sensitivity by using such antigens might be similar to that 
      obtained by using crude or semipurified antigens, specificity was somewhat improved 
      to over 95%. Among serological tools, ELISA has been the method of choice for 
      detecting serum antibodies and mycobacterial antigens from clinical specimens 
      because of its high sensitivity, simplicity, reproducibility and versatility in 
      screening a large number of specimens. Further simple and rapid tests such as the 
      agglutination test by coating various particles with purified or synthetic M. 
      tuberculosis-specific antigens or antibodies will soon become available for field 
      evaluation in endemic areas of tuberculosis. However, all these efforts can be 
      justified only if serological tests give any meaningful information for the 
      diagnosis and management of tuberculosis or for determining the degree of M. 
      tuberculosis transmission in a community as a complement to the current tuberculin 
      test, chest X-ray, or sputum examination. Although the detection of mycobacterial 
      antigens from CSF or sputum specimens using polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies gave 
      more direct evidence for M. tuberculosis infection, the information by the assays 
      was not sufficient to determine whether these immunological tools could be used in 
      clinical laboratories for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Meanwhile, recent 
      introduction of the very sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology for 
      the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA from clinical specimens (37-40) may eventually 
      replace the immunological assays for the detection of mycobacterial 
      antigens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Childhood tuberculosis is difficult to diagnose. A rapid, simple and relatively 
      inexpensive diagnostic test will be crucial to future control efforts. Therefore, 
      efficacy and diagnostic potential of different secretory antigens of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (CFP-10, Ag85complex, Ag85 A, B, C) and their combinations along with 
      ESAT-6 in the detection of antibody profiles of childhood tuberculosis cases were 
      evaluated using ELISA technique and reactivity was compared with the gold standards 
      (smear, culture and IS6110 targeted PCR). In the present study, 88 fresh, untreated 
      childhood tuberculosis (TB) cases, 17 children undergoing anti-tubercular therapy, 
      17 children having disease other than TB and 25 healthy children were included. ROC 
      curve analysis was used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of each antigen 
      for antibody detection. Ag85C was found to be showing highest sensitivity of 89.77% 
      and specificity of 92% among all the antigens used (P < 0.0001). Positivity with 
      antigen was 95% in smear and culture negative patients. Antibody reactivity was 
      noted in 92.62% of patients who were positive for IS6110 by PCR. Cocktail of all the 
      antigens showed 67.1% sensitivity and 80% of specificity. Sensitivity of 29.55%, 
      57.95%, 64.77% and specificity of 80%, 72%, 64% was observed using CFP-10, 
      Ag85complex and Ag85B. Low reactivity of 31.82% in patients and least specificity of 
      24% was noted with Ag85A. Our finding demonstrates the potential of Ag85C in the 
      detection of antibody in childhood TB cases and this antigen showed good concordance 
      with PCR positivity.

AB  - Several studies showed that assessing levels of specific circulating microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) is a non-invasive, rapid, and accurate method for diagnosing diseases or 
      detecting alterations in physiological conditions. We aimed to identify a serum 
      miRNA signature to be used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). To account for 
      variations due to the genetic makeup, we enrolled adults from two study settings in 
      Europe and Africa. The following categories of subjects were considered: healthy 
      (H), active pulmonary TB (PTB), active pulmonary TB, HIV co-infected (PTB/HIV), 
      latent TB infection (LTBI), other pulmonary infections (OPI), and active 
      extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB). Sera from 10 subjects of the same category were pooled 
      and, after total RNA extraction, screened for miRNA levels by TaqMan low-density 
      arrays. After identification of "relevant miRNAs", we refined the serum miRNA 
      signature discriminating between H and PTB on individual subjects. Signatures were 
      analyzed for their diagnostic performances using a multivariate logistic model and a 
      Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model. A leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) 
      approach was adopted for assessing how both models could perform in practice. The 
      analysis on pooled specimens identified selected miRNAs as discriminatory for the 
      categories analyzed. On individual serum samples, we showed that 15 miRNAs serve as 
      signature for H and PTB categories with a diagnostic accuracy of 82% (CI 70.2-90.0), 
      and 77% (CI 64.2-85.9) in a RVM and a logistic classification model, respectively. 
      Considering the different ethnicity, by selecting the specific signature for the 
      European group (10 miRNAs) the diagnostic accuracy increased up to 83% (CI 
      68.1-92.1), and 81% (65.0-90.3), respectively. The African-specific signature (12 
      miRNAs) increased the diagnostic accuracy up to 95% (CI 76.4-99.1), and 100% 
      (83.9-100.0), respectively. Serum miRNA signatures represent an interesting source 
      of biomarkers for TB disease with the potential to discriminate between PTB and 
      LTBI, but also among the other categories.

TI  - Study of KIR expression and HLA ligands in CD56+ lymphocytes of drug resistant 
      tuberculosis patients.
PG  - 189-94
AB  - Analysis of receptor-ligand interactions in the context of diseases necessitates to 
      understand how HLA-KIR genotypes function in diseases. Although CD56+ lymphocytes 
      are derived from multiple lineages, they share a functional association with 
      immunosurviellance and antimicrobial responses. The present study aimed to determine 
      whether KIR phenotype in CD56 lymphocytes and corresponding HLA-class 1 ligands are 
      associated with multidrug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB). We compared the 
      frequencies of HLA-C and HLA-BW4 genes, the expression of KIRs 2DL1/2DS1, 2DL2/2DL3, 
      3DL1, and 2DS4 and the combinations of HLA/KIR in 32 Nifamycin and 
      Isoniazid-resistant TB with those in 68 drug non resistant (NR) sputum smear 
      positive pulmonary TB patients. PCR-SSP and flow cytometry were performed for HLA 
      and KIRs typing, respectively. We showed no significant differences between 
      inhibitory or activating KIRs as well as HLA ligands in MDR TB patients compared 
      with NR-TB . The combinations of inhibitory KIR-HLA ligands in MDR-TB were much more 
      prevalent, but not statistically significant than in NR patients (p=0.07). The 
      frequency of MDR patients with all HLA-C and HLA-BW4 ligands was higher than NR-TB 
      (p<0.009). Conversely, the percentage of MDR patients having only one kind of HLA 
      gene was significantly lower than NR-TB (p<0.01). We conclude that the expression of 
      inhibitory KIRs with corresponding HLA ligands genes, and/or co-existence of three 
      HLA class 1 ligands for inhibitory KIRs may be associated with drug resistance in 
      pulmonary tuberculosis.

PG  - 200-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to reveal whether CCL1 rs159294 T/A 
      polymorphism in pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis patients pose a risk to 
      catch tuberculosis or not. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the study, peripheral blood 
      samples from the control group, which includes 160 patients, who consulted to Fırat 
      University Faculty of Medicine, Pulmonology Policlinic in Elazığ province and who 
      were diagnosed with tuberculosis; and 160 healthy individuals, were taken and put 
      into tubes containing EDTA. Each tube contained 2 cc blood samples. DNA isolation 
      was made from these blood samples and CCL1 rs159294 T/A polymorphism was defined 
      with PCR-RFLP analysis. RESULTS: For CCL1 rs159294 T/A polymorphism, TT genotype was 
      found in 98 (61.3%) patients, TA genotype was found in 58 (36.3%) patients, AA 
      genotype was found in 4 (2.5%) patients among 160 patients with tuberculosis; and TT 
      genotype was found in 50 (70.4%) patients, TA genotype in 20 (28.2%) patients, AA 
      genotype was found in 1 (1.4%) patient among 71 patients with pulmonary 
      tuberculosis; TT genotype was found in 48 (53.9%) patients TA genotype was found in 
      38 (42.7%) patients and AA genotype was found in 3 (3.4%) patients among 89 
      extrapulmonary tuberculosis patients. And in control group, among 160 healthy 
      individuals, TT genotype was found in 100 (62.5%) individuals, TA genotype was found 
      in 58 (36.3%) individuals, AA genotype was found in 2 (1.3%) individuals and no 
      statistically significant difference was found. CONCLUSION: CCL1 rs159294 T/A 
      polymorphism do not form an inclination to tuberculosis in our population.

TI  - How to optimize current (available) diagnostic tests.
PG  - 340-4
LID - 10.1007/s12098-010-0286-8 [doi]
AB  - Isolation of mycobacterium tuberculosis is the gold standard in the diagnosis of 
      childhood tuberculosis. However, it has inherent limitations due to paucibacillary 
      nature of the disease in children and technical difficulties encountered in 
      collection of appropriate sample. Thus, diagnosis is dependent on circumstantial 
      evidence at best supported by conventional tests such as tuberculin test and chest 
      radiograph. Several new tests are being developed but they lack ideal sensitivity 
      and specificity. Hence, it is important to optimise use of current diagnostic tests. 
      Clinical suspicion based on protocol developed by IAP is a pre-requisite of ordering 
      tests and it is only then that proper interpretation is possible. Tuberculin skin 
      test is still a useful screening test. It does help in establishing presence of 
      infection though not necessarily disease. Attention must be paid to ideal test 
      solution, proper technique and cautious interpretation. BCG test is not recommended. 
      Miliary shadows and fibrocaseious cavitary lesions in chest radiograph are highly 
      suggestive of tuberculosis in our epidemiology. CT scan is rarely necessary and is 
      not cost and radiation-effective. It is ideal to attempt bacteriological examination 
      in every suspected case of childhood tuberculosis. Most practical method is 
      collection of gastric aspirate for smear and culture. It is possible to carry out 
      this procedure in out-patient clinic. Better yield is likely with increasing 
      expertise especially in extensive disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage is an invasive 
      test and bacterial yield is comparable to that of gastric aspirate. Tissue collected 
      for histopathological examination must be submitted for bacteriological tests. PCR 
      is not easily available. It has high sensitivity but lower specificity and thus, is 
      not routinely recommended. Serology has no place in diagnosis of tuberculosis. 
      Interferon gamma release assays are also now available. Sensitivity and specificity 
      of Quantiferon Gold and T-spot tests have not been studied in children and hence are 
      not recommended in routine practice. Instead of trying newer tests, it may be best 
      to avail an expert advice in difficult cases.

TI  - CD14 C(-159)T polymorphism is a risk factor for development of pulmonary 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 1698-706
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neither the expression of CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on 
      monocytes' surface nor the mutations CD14 -159TT and TLR4 Asp299Gly have yet been 
      evaluated as risk factors for development of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in the 
      Mexican population. METHODS: Level of membrane CD14 (mCD14) and membrane TLR4 
      (mTLR4) were determined by flow cytometry, in 104 patients with pulmonary TB (before 
      and after treatment), 67 household contacts, and 114 healthy control subjects. 
      Genotype/allele frequencies in CD14 -159 and TLR4 Asp299Gly were obtained by 
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction-fragment length polymorphism. Levels of 
      soluble CD14 (sCD14) in sera were quantified by ELISA. RESULTS: Higher levels of 
      mCD14/sCD14 and mTLR4 were observed in the patients and the household contacts than 
      in the control subjects (P<.05) and decreased in the patients after the infection 
      was resolved. The frequency of the CD14 -159TT genotype was higher in the patients 
      than in the control subjects (35.6% vs. 12.3%, respectively). Patients who were 
      homozygous for allele T of the CD14 promoter gene had a significantly higher risk 
      for development of pulmonary TB, with an odds ratio of 2.267 (95% confidence 
      interval, 1.5%-3.3%). Levels of sCD14 or mCD14 were not associated with the CD14 
      -159TT genotype (P>.05). CONCLUSIONS: No association between TLR4 Asp299Gly and 
      pulmonary TB was found. CD14 -159TT is a risk factor for development of pulmonary 
      TB, whereas mCD14/sCD14 and mTLR4 are possible biomarkers for the prognosis for TB 
      disease. CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL ID: SA1168-05.

TI  - Specific T cells restore the autophagic flux inhibited by Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      in human primary macrophages.
PG  - 1425-35
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jis226 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autophagy inhibits survival of intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      when induced by rapamycin or interferon γ (IFN-γ), but it remains unclear whether M. 
      tuberculosis itself can induce autophagy and whether T cells play a role in M. 
      tuberculosis-mediated autophagy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of 
      M. tuberculosis on autophagy in human primary macrophages and the role of specific T 
      cells in this process. METHODS: M. tuberculosis (H37Rv)-infected macrophages were 
      incubated with naive or M. tuberculosis-specific T cells. Autophagy was evaluated at 
      4 hours and 8 hours after infection by analyzing the levels of LC3-II (a hallmark of 
      autophagy) and p62 (a protein degraded by autophagy). M. tuberculosis survival was 
      evaluated by counting the colony-forming units. RESULTS: M. tuberculosis infection 
      of macrophages inhibited the autophagic process at 8 hours after infection. Naive T 
      cells could not rescue this block, whereas M. tuberculosis-specific T cells restored 
      autophagy degradation, accompanied by enhanced bacterial killing. Notably, the 
      effect of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells was not affected by neutralization of 
      endogenous IFN-γ and tumor necrosis factor α and was blocked by preventing contact 
      between macrophages and T cells, suggesting that cell-cell interaction is crucial. 
      CONCLUSIONS: M. tuberculosis inhibits autophagy in human primary macrophages, and 
      specific T cells can restore functional autophagic flux through cell-cell contact.

TI  - [The effect of MTB antigens on the NFAT5 expression in monocytes from human 
      peripheral blood].
PG  - 290-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens early 
      secretory antigen target 6/culture filtrate protein 10 (ESAT-6/CFP-10) on nuclear 
      factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) mRNA in monocytes from human peripheral blood. 
      METHODS: Fifteen patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (age range: 33-42 y, 
      mean: 37 y, male/female: 9/6) were recruited from the Institute of Tuberculosis in 
      309 Hospital, and 15 healthy subjects (age range: 37-42 y, mean: 40 y, male/female: 
      9/6) were recruited from Medical Examination Center of the hospital. Monocytes were 
      isolated from peripheral blood and stimulated with whole cell lysate of H37Rv strain 
      and peptide pool of ESAT-6/CFP-10. Fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect 
      the mRNA expression of NFAT5, and differences of NFAT5 mRNA between unstimulated and 
      stimulated monocytes were analyzed by paired t test statistic method. RESULTS: The 
      expression of NFAT5 mRNA in monocytes from patients with active pulmonary 
      tuberculosis was significantly decreased when stimulated with peptide pool of 
      ESAT-6/CFP-10 compared with unstimulated monocytes (0.18 ± 0.12 vs. 0.23 ± 0.15) (t 
      = 2.591, P < 0.05). Similarly, the expression of NFAT5 mRNA in monocytes from 
      healthy subjects was also significantly decreased when stimulated with peptide pool 
      of ESAT-6/CFP-10 compared with unstimulated monocytes (0.17 ± 0.09 vs 0.21 ± 0.09) 
      (t = 2.828, P < 0.05). However, the expression of NFAT5 mRNA in monocytes stimulated 
      with whole cell lysate was not significantly changed (t = 1.142, P > 0.05), which 
      was 0.28 ± 0.25 and 0.23 ± 0.15 in stimulated and unstimulated monocytes, 
      respectively. Similarly, the expression of NFAT5 mRNA in monocytes from healthy 
      subjects was also not significantly changed when stimulated with whole cell lysate 
      (t = 0.451 9, P > 0.05), which was 0.20 ± 0.12 and 0.21 ± 0.09 in stimulated and 
      unstimulated monocytes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The MTB antigen ESAT-6/CFP-10 can 
      inhibit NFAT5 expression in human monocytes in vitro.

AB  - Here we describe the development and validation of a highly sensitive assay of 
      antigen-specific IFN-γ production using real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for two 
      reporters--monokine-induced by IFN-γ (MIG) and the IFN-γ inducible protein-10 
      (IP10). We developed and validated the assay and applied it to the detection of CMV, 
      HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) specific responses, in a cohort of HIV 
      co-infected patients. We compared the sensitivity of this assay to that of the ex 
      vivo RD1 (ESAT-6 and CFP-10)-specific IFN-γ Elispot assay. We observed a clear 
      quantitative correlation between the two assays (P<0.001). Our assay proved to be a 
      sensitive assay for the detection of MTB-specific T cells, could be performed on 
      whole blood samples of fingerprick (50 uL) volumes, and was not affected by 
      HIV-mediated immunosuppression. This assay platform is potentially of utility in 
      diagnosis of infection in this and other clinical settings.

TI  - Peripheral-blood-based PCR assay to identify patients with active pulmonary 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 1082-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. We have 
      previously used a PCR to detect circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in blood 
      samples from patients (mostly HIV-infected) with pulmonary tuberculosis. We have now 
      prospectively investigated the role of this blood-based PCR assay for diagnosis of 
      this disease in a clinical setting. METHODS: Our PCR assay is specific for the 
      IS6110 insertion element of the M tuberculosis complex of organisms. We used it to 
      test peripheral blood from 88 consecutive patients admitted to a chest ward with 
      suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Personnel who carried out the assay did not know 
      the results of any clinical investigations and ultimate diagnosis, and clinicians 
      did not know the PCR results. Results of the PCR assay were compared with the final 
      clinical diagnosis. A subgroup of 15 patients had blood samples assayed serially to 
      track the PCR signal over time. FINDINGS: 41 patients had a final clinical diagnosis 
      of tuberculosis, and the cases were typical of those seen at our hospital: HIV 
      infection was common, and most cases were not sputum-smear positive for acid-fast 
      bacilli. The PCR assay correctly identified 39 of 41 patients with proven pulmonary 
      tuberculosis, 26 (63%) of whom were sputum-smear negative. There were five patients 
      in whom a positive PCR result did not accord with the final clinical diagnosis, and 
      two of the 44 negative PCR results were classified as false negatives. The overall 
      sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay for a diagnosis of tuberculosis was 95% 
      and 89%, respectively. In 15 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and a positive 
      blood assay,the PCR result remained positive after 1 month of therapy, but had 
      reverted to negative in 13 of the 15 by 4 months of therapy. INTERPRETATION: We 
      conclude that peripheral-blood-based PCR detection for the diagnosis of tuberculosis 
      is a technically feasible approach that has a potentially important role in the 
      diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.

PG  - e105628
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0105628 [doi]
LID - e105628
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antigen specific release of IP-10 is the most promising alternative 
      marker to IFN-γ for infection with M. tuberculosis. Compared to Interferon-γ release 
      assays (IGRA), IP-10 is released in high levels enabling novel approaches such as 
      field friendly dried blood spots (DBS) and molecular detection. AIM: To develop a 
      robust IP-10 based molecular assay for the diagnosis of infection with M. 
      tubercuolsis from whole blood and DBS. METHOD: We developed a one-step probe based 
      multiplex RT-qPCR assay for detecting IP-10 and IFN-γ mRNA expression from whole 
      blood and DBS samples. The assay was validated and applied for the diagnosis of M. 
      tuberculosis infection in DBS samples from 43 patients with confirmed TB, 13 
      patients with latent TB and 96 presumed uninfected controls. In parallel, IP-10 and 
      INF-γ levels were measured in Quantiferon (QFT-TB) plasma supernatants. RESULTS: 
      IP-10 mRNA upregulation was detectable at 4 hours after stimulation (6 fold 
      upregulation) peaking at 8 hours (108 fold upregulation). IFN-γ expression occurred 
      in concert but levels were lower (peak 6.7 fold upregulation). IP-10 gene expression 
      level was significantly higher in patients with tuberculosis (median 31.2, IQR 
      10.7-67.0) and persons with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) (41.2, IQR 
      9.8-64.9) compared to healthy controls (1.6, IQR 1.1-2.4; p<0.0001). The IP-10 mRNA 
      and protein based tests had comparable diagnostic accuracy to QFT-TB, sensitivity 
      (85% and 88% vs 85%) and specificity (96% and 96% vs 97%, p = ns.). CONCLUSION: We 
      developed a rapid, robust and accurate molecular immunodiagnostic test for M. 
      tuberculosis infection. By combining DBS based sample acquisition, mail or currier 
      based sample transport with centralized molecular detection, this immunodiagnostic 
      test concept can reduce the local technological requirements everywhere and make it 
      possible to offer highly accurate immunodiagnostic tests in low resource settings.

TI  - Recruitment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific CD4+ T cells to the site of 
      infection for diagnosis of active tuberculosis.
PG  - 163-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-2796.2008.02012.x [doi]
AB  - Accurate and early diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) is problematic as current 
      diagnostic methods show low sensitivity (acid-fast bacilli smears), are 
      time-consuming (culture of biological samples) or show variable results 
      [Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific PCR]. OBJECTIVES: In the course of 
      infection, MTB-specific T cells clonally expand at the site of infection and may 
      thus be used as diagnostic marker for active disease. DESIGN: In this cohort study, 
      the frequency of MTB-specific, interferon (IFN)-gamma expressing CD4(+) T cells 
      obtained from peripheral blood and the site of disease in 25 patients with suspected 
      TB was assessed (n = 11, bronchoalveolar lavage; n = 7, pleural fluid; n = 1, 
      ascites; n = 1, joint fluid; n = 5, cerebrospinal fluid). RESULTS: Amongst 15 
      patients who showed proven active TB infection, a striking increase of MTB-specific 
      T cells was detected at the site of infection compared with peripheral blood (median 
      increase: 28.5-fold, range: 7.25-531 fold; median of IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) T 
      cells from blood: 0.02%, range: 0-0.52%; median of IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) T 
      cells from the site of infection: 1.81%, range: 0.29-6.55%, P < 0.001). MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURE: Recruitment of MTB-specific T cells to the site of infection yielded a 
      sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90%, irrespective of the compartment 
      affected. CONCLUSIONS: The accumulation of MTB-specific T cells at the site of 
      infection may prove as useful diagnostic marker for an accurate and rapid diagnosis 
      of active TB.

TI  - Accuracy and utility of commercially available amplification and serologic tests for 
      the diagnosis of minimal pulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - 1323-9
AB  - Diagnosis of patients with minimal active tuberculosis (TB) is difficult, as there 
      is no single test with high sensitivity and specificity. The yield and clinical 
      utility of a combination of diagnostic tests were prospectively studied among 500 
      consecutive patients referred for sputum induction for diagnosis of possible active 
      TB. Patients underwent sputum induction, chest X-ray, tuberculin testing, and had 
      blood drawn for serologic testing (Detect-TB test; Biochem ImmunoSystems). Sputum 
      was examined with fluorescent microscopy and PCR (Amplicor MTB-Roche) and cultured 
      for mycobacteria using liquid (BACTEC) and solid media. For the diagnosis of the 60 
      cases of active TB, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of the following 
      diagnostic tests were mycobacterial culture, 73% and 100%; PCR, 42% and 100%; chest 
      X-ray, 67-77% and 66-76%; tuberculin testing, 94% and 20%; and serology, 33% and 
      87%. After consideration of PCR and radiographic and clinical characteristics, a 
      positive serologic test was independantly associated with diagnosis of active 
      disease (adjusted odds of disease if positive, 2.6; 95% confidence limits, 1.1,6.1). 
      No currently available test has sensitivity and specificity high enough for the 
      accurate diagnosis of minimal pulmonary TB. Utilization of a combination of tests, 
      together with consideration of key clinical characteristics, could improve 
      diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Improved tuberculosis diagnostics and tools for monitoring treatment response are 
      urgently needed. We developed a robust and simple, PCR-based host-blood 
      transcriptomic signature, RISK6, for multiple applications: identifying individuals 
      at risk of incident disease, as a screening test for subclinical or clinical 
      tuberculosis, and for monitoring tuberculosis treatment. RISK6 utility was validated 
      by blind prediction using quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR in seven independent 
      cohorts. Prognostic performance significantly exceeded that of previous signatures 
      discovered in the same cohort. Performance for diagnosing subclinical and clinical 
      disease in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected persons, assessed by area under the 
      receiver-operating characteristic curve, exceeded 85%. As a screening test for 
      tuberculosis, the sensitivity at 90% specificity met or approached the benchmarks 
      set out in World Health Organization target product profiles for non-sputum-based 
      tests. RISK6 scores correlated with lung immunopathology activity, measured by 
      positron emission tomography, and tracked treatment response, demonstrating utility 
      as treatment response biomarker, while predicting treatment failure prior to 
      treatment initiation. Performance of the test in capillary blood samples collected 
      by finger-prick was noninferior to venous blood collected in PAXgene tubes. These 
      results support incorporation of RISK6 into rapid, capillary blood-based 
      point-of-care PCR devices for prospective assessment in field studies.

TI  - Identification of Rv2041c, a novel immunogenic antigen from Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis with serodiagnostic potential.
PG  - 457-64
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3083.2009.02324.x [doi]
AB  - Novel immunogenic antigens are continually required for the improvement of 
      diagnostic techniques for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Some proteins with 
      serodiagnostic value are not expressed under normal culture conditions, but may be 
      induced under specific conditions such as gradual oxygen depletion and low pH, and 
      from inside macrophages. Using a customized amplification library, we previously 
      found that Rv2041c from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was highly expressed in vitro under 
      conditions of low pH and hypoxia. In this study, recombinant (r)Rv2041c was produced 
      in Escherichia coli to examine its role in immune responses. Increased Rv2041c 
      expression in vitro during dormancy and during infection in human macrophages was 
      confirmed by Western blotting and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, 
      respectively. Interestingly, positive antibody responses to rRv2041c were detected 
      only in those patients with active tuberculosis (TB) and in mice infected with M. 
      tuberculosis H37Rv. Finally, Rv2041c was used successfully in the serodiagnosis of 
      active M. tuberculosis infection in Korean patients in conjunction with other M. 
      tuberculosis proteins, including Ag85 complex, 38 kDa, rESAT-6, rHSP-X and rCFP-10. 
      Our Rv2041c-ELISA had comparable diagnostic sensitivity and equivalent specificity 
      to the use of an M. tuberculosis H37Rv cellular extract. In addition, seven of 46 
      serum samples collected from TB patients (15.28%) showed positive antibody responses 
      to Rv2041c, but not to the other proteins. These results suggest that Rv2041c can be 
      used to increase assay sensitivity alongside well-known antigens for the 
      serodiagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection.

PG  - 325-32
AB  - Performance of the polymerase chain reaction technique based on IS6110 sequence was 
      evaluated in clinical samples obtained from pulmonary and extrapulmonary cases of 
      tuberculosis. One hundred and seventy two samples were processed for detection of M. 
      tuberculosis by ZN stained smear examination, LJ medium culture, BACTEC radiometric 
      culture and PCR tests amplifying 123bp region of IS6110 sequence. A significant 
      difference was seen in the sensitivities of different tests, the figures being 83% 
      for PCR test, 35.2% for smear examination, 47.16% for LJ culture and 53.45% for 
      BACTEC culture (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found as far as 
      specificity was concerned. PCR test sensitivity in. pulmonary and extrapulmonary 
      clinical samples were 90.14% and 77.27% respectively and found to be significantly 
      higher (p < 0.05) when compared with those of other tests. The mean detection time 
      for M. tuberculosis was 24.03 days by LJ medium culture, 12.89 days by BACTEC 
      culture and less than one day by PCR test. PCR based on IS6100 sequence is highly 
      sensitive method for the early diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary 
      tuberculosis.

TI  - A rapid and non-invasive 2-step algorithm for diagnosing tuberculous peritonitis 
      using a T cell-based assay on peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid mononuclear 
      cells together with peritoneal fluid adenosine deaminase.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A recently developed RD-1 gene-based assay for diagnosing tuberculous 
      peritonitis (TBP) has given promising results. We therefore created a clinical 
      algorithm for differentiating TBP from other diagnoses using peripheral blood and 
      peritoneal fluid mononuclear cells (PBMC/PF-MC) along with conventional tests. 
      METHODS: All adult patients with suspected TBP in whom enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      spot (ELISPOT) assays were performed both on PBMC and PF-MC were prospectively 
      enrolled over a 6-year period. Confirmed TBP with positive cultures or Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis PCR, probable TBP with PF changes consistent with TBP, caseating 
      granuloma, and a successful response to anti-TB therapy, as well as possible TBP 
      without exclusion of TBP, were each defined. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients were 
      enrolled. Of these, 45 (61%) (19 confirmed, 16 probable, and 10 possible) were 
      classified as TBP. The other 29 (39%) patients were classified as not TB. The 
      sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of the tested methods for diagnosing TBP 
      were as follows: PBMC ELISPOT (≥6 spots), 84% and 59%; PF-MC ELISPOT (≥6 spots), 87% 
      and 86%; PF-MC/PBMC ratio (≥3), 69% and 97%; and PF-ADA level (≥21 U/L), 82% and 
      79%. The areas under the ROC curves were as follows: PF-MC ELISPOT, 0.90; PF-MC/PBMC 
      ratio, 0.82; PBMC ELISPOT, 0.80; and PF-ADA, 0.80, respectively. When a 2-step 
      algorithm ('PBMC ELISPOT ≥6 spots or PF-ADA ≥21 U/L' as a rule-out test and 
      'PF-MC/PBMC ratio ≥3' as a rule-in test) was applied, 67% (30/45) of the patients 
      with TBP were accurately classified without undergoing invasive procedures. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A 2-step algorithm using the PBMC/PF-MC ELISPOT assays and PF-ADA 
      appears to be a promising rapid and non-invasive approach for diagnosing TBP.

TI  - Identification of HIV patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis using urine based 
      polymerase chain reaction assay.
PG  - 145-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the increased dissemination of tuberculosis among HIV infected 
      patients, the diagnosis is difficult to establish. Traditional microbiological 
      methods lack satisfactory sensitivity. We have developed a highly sensitive and 
      specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) capable of detecting Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis DNA in urine specimens and have used this test to examine urine 
      specimens from HIV patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: Urine 
      specimens from 13 HIV infected patients with microbiologically proven active 
      pulmonary tuberculosis, 10 AIDS patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial 
      infection (documented by blood culture), 53 AIDS patients with no evidence of 
      mycobacterial disease, and 80 healthy subjects (25 with positive skin test to 
      purified protein derivative) were tested for M tuberculosis using PCR, acid fast 
      staining (AFS), and culture. RESULTS: Of the urine specimens from patients with 
      active tuberculosis, all tested positive by PCR, two by culture, and none by AFS. No 
      reactivity was observed in urine specimens from patients with non-tuberculous 
      mycobacterial infection. Of the 53 AIDS patients without mycobacterial infection, 
      one had a positive urine PCR. Normal subjects were all negative. CONCLUSIONS: Urine 
      based nested PCR for M tuberculosis may be a useful test for identifying HIV 
      patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.

AB  - RATIONALE: The rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is difficult when acid 
      fast bacilli (AFB) cannot be detected in sputum smears. OBJECTIVES: Following a 
      proof of principle study, we examined in routine clinical practice whether 
      individuals with sputum AFB smear-negative TB can be discriminated from those with 
      latent TB infection by local immunodiagnosis with a Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis-specific enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay. METHODS: Subjects 
      suspected of having active TB who were unable to produce sputum or with AFB-negative 
      sputum smears were prospectively enrolled at Tuberculosis Network European 
      Trialsgroup centers in Europe. ELISpot with early-secretory-antigenic-target-6 and 
      culture-filtrate-protein-10 peptides was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs) and bronchoalveolar lavage mononuclear cells (BALMCs). M. 
      tuberculosis-specific nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) was performed on 
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-one of 347 
      (20.4%) patients had active TB. Out of 276 patients who had an alternative 
      diagnosis, 127 (46.0%) were considered to be latently infected with M. tuberculosis 
      by a positive PBMC ELISpot result. The sensitivity and specificity of BALMC ELISpot 
      for the diagnosis of active pulmonary TB were 91 and 80%, respectively. The BALMC 
      ELISpot (diagnostic odds ratio [OR], 40.4) was superior to PBMC ELISpot (OR, 10.0), 
      tuberculin skin test (OR, 7.8), and M. tuberculosis specific NAAT (OR, 12.4) to 
      diagnose sputum AFB smear-negative TB. In contrast to PBMC ELISpot and tuberculin 
      skin test, the BALMC ELISpot was not influenced by previous history of TB. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Bronchoalveolar lavage ELISpot is an important advancement to rapidly 
      distinguish sputum AFB smear-negative TB from latent TB infection in routine 
      clinical practice.

TI  - Peripheral blood-based polymerase chain reaction in diagnosis of pulmonary 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 25-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rapid diagnosis of infectious diseases, particularly those that 
      represent a public health problem, like tuberculosis, is a challenging problem. By 
      using nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, one may be able to diagnose, 
      the disease on the day of arrival of specimen in the laboratory. For diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis by direct methods like PCR, specimens from site of infection are 
      required. In certain cases it is difficult to get the specimens from site of 
      infection and in such situations; some researchers have tried to detect the DNA of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from blood of these patients. The purposive of 
      this study is to determine the diagnostic efficacy of peripheral blood-based 
      polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: This was 
      a simple descriptive study, carried out in Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces 
      Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi from Jan 2004 to Dec 2004. Sputum and blood 
      samples were collected from 96 suspected patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum 
      samples processed for ZN staining and AFB culture (gold standard) and blood samples 
      processed for PCR. RESULTS: Out of 96 cases, 60 (62.5%) were culture positive. PCR 
      was positive in 14 (14.5%). AFB smear positive were 34 (35.4%). The overall 
      sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 20% and 94.4% respectively and the 
      positive and negative predictive values were 85.71% and 41.46% respectively. The 
      overall efficiency of the test was 47.91%. CONCLUSION: Due to low sensitivity; a 
      negative PCR assay does not rule the disease. However, this test may be helpful in 
      cases where specimens from the site of infection are not available.

TI  - [Mycobacterium tuberculosis. From the gene to the diagnosis].
PG  - 38-45
AB  - Pulmonary tuberculosis still in on the list of the world major health problems. 
      Tuberculosis has not been eradicated yet, from developing countries. Furthermore, 
      its incidence is increasing in the industrialized world, due to the human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. In this regard, atypical clinical 
      presentation of tuberculosis in individuals who have a deficient immune system, such 
      as those at risk of tuberculosis because of HIV infection, makes the diagnostic 
      process more difficult. Tuberculosis cases are often diagnosed later in HIV 
      individuals compared to non-HIV individuals. The ensuing greater risk of contagion 
      thus requires rapid and sensitive diagnostic protocols. In this context, several 
      biotechnological tools have been developed that can be applied to the diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis genes have been cloned, monoclonal antibodies against 
      pure proteins have been produced, thus enabling researchers to generate molecular 
      and biochemical probes. As a consequence, DNA hybridization and DNA amplification 
      techniques have been applied to the detection of mycobacteria, and ELISA kits of 
      high sensitivity are been already made available. In regard to the latter, it is 
      likely that monospecific and highly sensitive immunoassays will be developed that 
      are directed against "active disease" immunodominant antigens. It may thus be 
      expected that future new technologies will supplement the traditional tools for the 
      diagnosis of tuberculosis and rapid diagnosis protocols will be available to chest 
      clinicians in a foreseeable future.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of early diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis by different 
      assays.
PG  - 3160-6
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood (PBL) were sampled multiple times 
      from 25 patients with a clinical diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and 49 
      controls, including 27 patients with other infectious diseases of the central 
      nervous system and 22 patients with other noninfectious neurological diseases. We 
      used an enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) to detect anti-Mycobacterium bovis 
      BCG antibody-secreting cells in CSF and PBL, PCR to detect a repeated insertion 
      sequence (IS6110) specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in CSF, and an 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect anti-BCG antibodies in CSF and 
      PBL. In the meantime, culture of CSF from every TBM and control patient was done on 
      Lowenstein-Jensen medium. ELISPOT proved to be the most valuable test, with a 
      sensitivity of 84.0% and a specificity of 91.8%, and showed a sensitivity of 100.0% 
      with the CSF specimens obtained within 4 weeks after the onset of TBM. The numbers 
      of CSF anti-BCG immunoglobulin-secreting cells tested by ELISPOT were even higher in 
      the early phase of TBM and declined while the disease was going on (P = 0.008), 
      which allowed an early diagnosis to be made. The sensitivities of PCR and ELISA were 
      only 75.0% and 52.3%, respectively; and the specificities were 93.7% and 91.6%, 
      respectively. Culture of CSF on Lowenstein-Jensen medium was the least sensitive 
      (16%) compared to the sensitivities of the other three assays. Our results 
      demonstrate that the ELISPOT technique is worthy for routine use in the laboratory 
      to support the clinical diagnosis of TBM.

TI  - Mycobacterial infection in natural killer T cell knockout mice.
PG  - 97-104
AB  - To gain a better understanding of the pathological role of natural killer (NK) T 
      cells in murine tuberculosis, NKT knockout (KO) mice (J(alpha)281(-/-)mice) were 
      utilized. Eight-week-old NKT KO mice of BALB/c origin and wild-type (WT) mice were 
      infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Kurono strain by the airborne route using 
      an airborne infection apparatus, and their capacity to control mycobacterial growth, 
      granuloma formation, and cytokine production were examined. The NKT KO mice 
      developed granulomatous lesions in the lungs; there was no statistically significant 
      difference in pulmonary granuloma size between NKT KO and WT mice (p<0.01). The 
      average CFU values increased 3 weeks post-infection, but decreased 9 and 11 weeks 
      post-infection, in the lungs of NKT KO mice. When stimulated with Kurono strain in 
      vitro, splenic cells from NKT KO mice produced less IFN-gamma than did those from WT 
      mice. Expression of mRNA for IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12 p40 was slightly 
      lower in NKT KO mice compared with WT mice. Our data indicate that NKT cells play a 
      detrimental role in late-phase mycobacterial infection, although Th1 cells are 
      essential in early-phase mycobacterial infection.

TI  - Use of visual loop-mediated isotheral amplification of rimM sequence for rapid 
      detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis.
PG  - 339-43
LID - 10.1016/j.mimet.2009.07.006 [doi]
AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis are pathogenic bacterial species 
      in the genus Mycobacterium and the causative agents of most cases of tuberculosis 
      (TB). Detection of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis using conventional culture- and 
      biochemical-based assays is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, a simple and 
      sensitive method for rapid detection has been anxiously awaited. In the present 
      study, a visual loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was designed 
      from the rimM (encoding 16S rRNA-processing protein) gene sequence and used to 
      rapidly detect M. tuberculosis and M. bovis from clinical samples in South China. 
      The visual LAMP reaction was performed by adding calcein and manganous ion, allowing 
      the results to be read by simple visual observation of color change in a closed-tube 
      system, and which takes less than 1 h at 65 degrees C. The assay correctly 
      identified 84 M. tuberculosis isolates, 3 M. bovis strains and 1 M. bovis BCG 
      samples, but did not detect 51 non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) isolates and 8 
      other bacterial species. Sensitivity of this assay for detection of genomic DNA was 
      1 pg. Specific amplification was confirmed by the ladder-like pattern of gel 
      electrophoresis and restriction enzyme HhaI digestion. The assay successfully 
      detected M. tuberculosis and M. bovis not only in pure bacterial culture but also in 
      clinical samples of sputum, pleural fluid and blood. The speed, specificity, 
      sensitivity of the rimM LAMP, the lack of a need for expensive equipment, and the 
      visual readout show great potential for clinical detection of M. tuberculosis and M. 
      bovis.

TI  - Impaired expression of perforin and granulysin in CD8+ T cells at the site of 
      infection in human chronic pulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - 5210-22
AB  - Protective immunity in tuberculosis is dependent on the coordinated release of 
      cytolytic effector molecules from effector T cells and the subsequent 
      granule-associated killing of infected target cells. In this study, we investigated 
      the expression of cytolytic (perforin and granzyme A) and antimicrobial (granulysin) 
      molecules at the single-cell level in cryopreserved lung tissue from patients with 
      chronic, progressive tuberculosis disease. Quantification of protein-expressing 
      cells was performed by in situ imaging, while mRNA levels in the infected tissue 
      were analyzed by real-time PCR. Persistent inflammation, including excessive 
      expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in CD68+ macrophages and significant 
      infiltration of CD3+, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, was evident in tuberculosis lesions in 
      all patients. However, despite the accumulation of CD3+ T cells, perforin- and 
      granulysin-expressing CD3+ T cells were detected at two- to threefold-lower ratios 
      in the tuberculosis lesions than in distal lung parenchyma and uninfected control 
      lungs, respectively. This was evident at both the protein and mRNA levels. Moreover, 
      perforin- and granulysin-expressing CD8+ T cells were scarce in individual 
      granulomas within the tuberculosis lesions. In contrast, significant up-regulation 
      of granzyme A-expressing CD3+ T cells was evident in the lesions from all patients. 
      Confocal microscopy revealed coexpression of perforin and granulysin, primarily in 
      CD8+ T cells; however, this expression was lower in the tuberculosis lesions. These 
      findings suggest that symptomatic, chronic tuberculosis disease is associated with 
      insufficient up-regulation of perforin and granulysin coexpression in CD8+ T cells 
      at the local site of infection.

TI  - Etiology of pulmonary infections in predominantly HIV-infected adults with suspected 
      tuberculosis, Botswana.
PG  - 714-23
AB  - SETTING: In countries with high HIV rates, diagnosis of lower respiratory disease 
      etiology is both challenging and clinically important. OBJECTIVE: To determine the 
      etiology of lower respiratory tract disease among persons with suspected 
      tuberculosis (TB) and abnormal chest X-rays in a setting with very high HIV 
      seroprevalence. DESIGN: Cross-sectional prevalence data from a prospective cohort of 
      predominantly hospitalized adults with suspected TB in Botswana, January-December 
      1997. RESULTS: Of 229 patients, 86% were HIV-positive and 71% had a pathogen 
      identified. TB was confirmed in 52%, 17% had acute mycoplasma pneumonia, 3% had 
      Pneumocystis carinii, 27% grew a bacterial pathogen from sputum and 8% from blood. 
      Ninety-four per cent of TB diagnoses were made through expectorated sputum and only 
      5% of TB cases were diagnosed by sputum induction alone. Polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) for Mycobacterium tuberculosis had positive and negative predictive values of 
      94% and 59%, respectively. Male sex, cough < 2 weeks, and tuberculin skin test > or 
      = 5 mm were independently associated with culture-positive TB among persons with 
      negative acid-fast bacilli smears. Co-infection with two or more pathogens occurred 
      in 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was quite common despite 
      clinical suspicion of TB, and sputum induction and PCR did not significantly improve 
      our ability to diagnose TB, although clinical presentation had some predictive 
      value.

AB  - Early secreted antigenic target-6 (ESAT-6), an important Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      T-cell antigen, is an attractive candidate antigen for tuberculosis subunit vaccine 
      development. Because ESAT-6 has a low inherent immunogenicity, we used Hepatitis B 
      virus core (HBc) protein as an immune carrier to enhance ESAT-6 immunogenicity. The 
      ESAT-6 gene was inserted into the major immunodominant region of the HBc molecule by 
      fusion PCR. The recombinant protein, HBc-ESAT-6 (HE6), was expressed in Escherichia 
      coli, and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of virus-like particles. The 
      immunogenicity of the chimeric particles was assessed in mice. Serological assays 
      and in vitro Th1-biased cytokine assays found that immunization with HE6 particles 
      elicited significantly higher ESAT-6-specific antibodies and CD4⁺/CD8⁺ T cell 
      responses in mice compared to immunization with recombinant ESAT-6 protein. These 
      data demonstrate the feasibility of HBc particles serving as an efficient immune 
      carrier for ESAT-6 and suggest that HE6 has potential for use in a tuberculosis 
      subunit vaccine.

PG  - 822-4
AB  - We report two human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27-positive cases of urogenital 
      tuberculosis (TB) with asymmetric polyarthritis. Stained smears with Ehrlich 
      Ziehl-Neelsen and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis complex (MTC) of the ejaculate were positive in both cases, despite 
      negative cultures. Stained smear, culture and PCR results of the synovial fluid for 
      mycobacteria were negative. The patients were diagnosed with Poncet's disease. 
      Polyarthritis was resolved rapidly with anti-tuberculosis treatment. We suggest that 
      in cases with unexplained arthritis and non-articular TB, Poncet's disease should be 
      considered. PCR can be used in the routine diagnostic algorithm when conventional 
      methods fail to identify MTC.

TI  - Amplification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from peripheral blood.
PG  - 3312-4
AB  - To determine the value of the PCR assay of lymphomonocytic blood cells for the 
      diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, we compared, in a prospective study, PCR 
      results with results of conventional diagnostic methods of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis detection. Clinical investigators who were unaware of the PCR data 
      classified 162 immunocompetent patients, who had been hospitalized because of 
      suspected pulmonary tuberculosis, in accordance with the recommendations of the 
      American Thoracic Society (ATS). By testing blood samples from these patients for 
      mycobacterial DNA with three different PCR systems, we were able to demonstrate that 
      nonquantitative PCR of peripheral blood leukocytes is of little value for the 
      specific diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. However, semiquantitative PCR assays 
      might have some significance since we found an increasing level of mycobacterial DNA 
      copies in blood from patients classified in ATS groups 2 to 5.

TI  - Compartmentalization of immune responses in human tuberculosis: few CD8+ effector T 
      cells but elevated levels of FoxP3+ regulatory t cells in the granulomatous lesions.
PG  - 2211-24
LID - 10.2353/ajpath.2009.080941 [doi]
AB  - Immune responses were assessed at the single-cell level in lymph nodes from children 
      with tuberculous lymphadenitis. Tuberculosis infection was associated with tissue 
      remodeling of lymph nodes as well as altered cellular composition. Granulomas were 
      significantly enriched with CD68+ macrophages expressing the M. tuberculosis 
      complex-specific protein antigen MPT64 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. There 
      was a significant increase in CD8+ cytolytic T cells surrounding the granuloma; 
      however, CD8+ T cells expressed low levels of the cytolytic and antimicrobial 
      effector molecules perforin and granulysin in the granulomatous lesions. 
      Quantitative real-time mRNA analysis revealed that interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha, and interleukin-17 were not up-regulated in infected lymph nodes, but 
      there was a significant induction of both transforming growth factor-beta and 
      interleukin-13. In addition, granulomas contained an increased number of CD4+FoxP3+ 
      T cells co-expressing the immunoregulatory cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 and 
      glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor molecules. Low numbers of CD8+ 
      T cells in the lesions correlated with high levels of transforming growth 
      factor-beta and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, suggesting active immunosuppression at 
      the local infection site. Compartmentalization and skewing of the immune response 
      toward a regulatory phenotype may result in an uncoordinated effector T-cell 
      response that reduces granule-mediated killing of M. tuberculosis-infected cells and 
      subsequent disease control.

      patients with M. tuberculosis bacteremia, 9 (36.0%) were positive and 1 (1.5%) of 66 
      control samples was positive by NAAT. The NAAT shows promise, but modifications 
      should focus on improving sensitivity.

TI  - FOXP3 gene expression in a tuberculosis case contact study.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - Regulatory T lymphocytes (T(regs)) that express FOXP3 are involved in the beneficial 
      attenuation of immunopathology, but are also implicated in down-regulation of 
      protective responses to infection. Their role in tuberculosis (TB) is unknown. We 
      classified 1272 healthy TB contacts according to their tuberculin skin test (TST) 
      and interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) results and 128 TB 
      cases, and studied the expression of FOXP3 and interleukin (IL)-10 in blood samples. 
      Compared to the uninfected contact group (TST(-), ELISPOT(-)), we observed higher 
      levels of FOXP3 mRNA in blood from TB patients (< 0.001), but IL-10 expression was 
      slightly lower (P = 0.04). In contrast, FOXP3 expression levels were significantly 
      lower (P = 0.001) in the recently infected contacts (TST(+), ELISPOT(+)) but there 
      was no difference for IL-10 (P = 0.74). We hypothesize that during early/subclinical 
      TB, most of which will become latent, FOXP3(+) T(regs) may be sequestered in the 
      lungs, but when TB becomes progressive, FOXP3 reappears at increased levels in the 
      periphery. While these findings do not reveal the role, beneficial or harmful, of 
      T(regs) in TB, they emphasize the probable importance of these cells.

TI  - Prospective evaluation of in-house polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of 
      mycobacterial diseases in patients with HIV infection and lung infiltrates.
PG  - 106-13
AB  - SETTING: Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in AIDS is critical for optimal 
      treatment to reduce mycobacterial dissemination, HIV-1 replication and mortality. 
      The inadequate sensitivity of Ziehl-Neelsen staining and its inability to 
      distinguish atypical mycobacteria delays accurate diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 
      the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of TB in bronchoalveolar lavage 
      (BAL), blood and extra-pulmonary samples from patients with AIDS and pulmonary 
      infiltrates. DESIGN: Specimens from 103 HIV-1-infected patients were prospectively 
      analysed using bacteriological methods and IS6110-PCR. Smear-positive samples were 
      also tested using 16S ribosomal-DNA-PCR to identify Mycobacterium avium complex 
      (MAC) infections. Gold standard diagnosis relied on positive cultures or treatment 
      outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients exhibited TB, one TB and MAC and four MAC. 
      The sensitivity of IS6110-PCR was 100% in smear-positive samples, 81.8% in 
      smear-negative BAL, 66.7% in extra-pulmonary samples and 42.9% in blood. Its 
      specificity was 97.1% in BAL and 100% in extra-pulmonary and blood specimens. The 
      16S rDNA-PCR identified M. avium from all smear-positive samples that grew MAC. 
      CONCLUSIONS: IS6110-PCR proved useful in evaluating episodes with probable clinical 
      diagnosis of pulmonary or mixed TB and negative smears, whereas 16S rDNA-PCR would 
      be helpful for prompt differential diagnosis of MAC in smear-positive specimens.

TI  - Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in blood of patients with acute

PG  - 495-500
AB  - The detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMC) by PCR and non-isotopic hybridisation assay was evaluated for the 
      laboratory diagnosis of pulmonary M. tuberculosis infection. The PCR technique was 
      based on the presence of IS6110, a DNA sequence specific for M. tuberculosis, and 
      performed on PBMC from 30 patients belonging to the fifth group of the American 
      Thoracic Society (ATS) classification of tuberculosis. The identification of 
      amplification products was confirmed after electrophoresis by hybridisation with a 
      non-isotopic probe in a DNA enzyme immunoassay (DEIA). Of the 30 blood samples 
      studied by the PCR-DEIA technique, 26 gave positive results and four gave negative 
      results. Blood samples from 30 subjects in a control group were negative by this 
      technique. The data suggest that PCR-DEIA of blood may provide a sensitive, specific 
      and useful means of diagnosing mycobacterial infection.

TI  - Comparison between IS6110 and MPB64 primers for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis in Bangladesh by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
PG  - 87-94
AB  - The study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of two different primers in PCR 
      based diagnosis of tuberculosis on the basis of the time involvement, steps of PCR, 
      cost and accuracy of results. Among 17 clinically suspected pulmonary tuberculosis 
      patient's (M:F 65:35) sputum samples, 12 were found positive by both primers. Among 
      81 routine samples (sputum = 12; blood = 27; cerebrospinal fluid = 16; ascitic fluid 
      = 12 and urine = 14), 12 were found to be positive by IS6110 primer while 13 were 
      found positive by MPB64. The result of M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in sputum, ascitic 
      fluid, CSF and urine samples were found to be similar in both the primers used. It 
      is suggested that, M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in blood samples using MPB64 primers 
      sometime gives false positive result and therefore, may not be recommended for blood 
      samples. As in other samples both the primers gave almost the same result and 
      therefore, both the primers can be used for MTB DNA PCR vice versa in order to cross 
      check if one gives dubious result.

PG  - 372-7
AB  - The Cobas Amplicor MTB test is a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique commonly 
      used for direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical samples. This 
      assay is only validated for respiratory specimens, but many physicians also request 
      PCR analyses for non-respiratory ones. 877 respiratory and 564 non-respiratory 
      specimens were analysed by this test. Using culture results as standard, the 
      sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of the 
      PCR were, respectively, 97.9%, 100%, 100% and 94.4% for smear-positive respiratory 
      specimens, 68.8%, 99.2%, 87.5% and 97.5% for smear-negative respiratory samples, 
      57.8%, 98.6%, 78.8% and 96.4% for all non-respiratory specimens, and 42.4%, 98.6%, 
      66.7% and 96.4% for smear-negative non-respiratory specimens. 154 cerebrospinal 
      fluid samples were analysed and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 
      55.6%, 97.2%, 55.6% and 97.2%, respectively. These results indicate that the Cobas 
      Amplicor MTB test enables detection of tuberculosis in respiratory specimens, but 
      does not perform well enough in non-respiratory specimens. The method fails 
      particularly in cases where a reliable and rapid test is urgently needed, e.g. in 
      tuberculous meningitis.

TI  - Genomic approach to identification of Mycobacterium bovis diagnostic antigens in 
      cattle.
PG  - 3719-28
AB  - Differential delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing with tuberculin purified 
      protein derivatives from Mycobacterium bovis and M. avium is the standard for 
      diagnosing bovine tuberculosis. However, improved tests based on defined, specific 
      antigens are urgently needed. In the present study, a combination of bioinformatics, 
      molecular biology, and bovine models of infection were used to screen mycobacterial 
      proteins for their potential as diagnostic reagents which could be used in a 
      whole-blood assay for diagnosis of tuberculosis. Initial screening of 28 proteins 
      selected in silico and expressed as recombinants in Escherichia coli indicated that 
      CFP-10, ESAT-6, TB27.4, TB16.2, TB15.8, and TB10.4 induced strong gamma interferon 
      responses in experimentally infected cattle. A more thorough investigation over time 
      in two groups of animals infected with a high (10(6) CFU) and a low (10(4) CFU) dose 
      of M. bovis revealed that, for both groups, the strength of the in vitro response to 
      individual antigens varied greatly over time. However, combining the results for 
      ESAT-6, CFP-10, and TB27.4, possibly supplemented with TB10.4, gave sensitivities at 
      different infection stages close to those obtained with M. bovis purified protein 
      derivative. Importantly, while responsiveness to ESAT-6 and CFP-10 correlated 
      strongly for individual samples, the same was not the case for ESAT-6 and TB27.4 
      responsiveness. The results suggest that combinations of specific antigens such as 
      these have great potential in development of optimized diagnostic systems for bovine 
      tuberculosis.

TI  - Peripheral blood based C-PCR assay for diagnosing extra-pulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - 447-53
AB  - Extra pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) constitutes around 20% of all tuberculosis cases 
      in India. Conventional methods are of limited use in diagnosing this form of the 
      disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has emerged as a sensitive and specific 
      tool for documenting the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical samples 
      but lacks quantitative ability. The present study evaluates peripheral blood as an 
      alternative clinical specimen for diagnosing EPTB. Peripheral blood samples from 38 
      EPTB and 89 non tuberculous subjects were analyzed for the presence of tubercle 
      bacilli by MPB 64 gene based PCR method. The assay gave an overall sensitivity of 
      60.53% with negative predictive value of 76.92% which is superior to present gold 
      standard of mycobacterial culture (10.53 and 72.36%). Additionally, 43.82% of non 
      tuberculous subjects gave positive results with the PCR, thus mitigating the 
      clinical utility of this test. An in-house Competitive PCR (C-PCR) assay was used to 
      determine the mycobacterial load in peripheral blood from culture positive, culture 
      negative EPTB patients and non tuberculous controls which ranged from 7498-12498, 
      602-4797 and 101-800 genome equivalent (ge)/mL, respectively. The data clearly 
      demonstrated that C-PCR assay can furnish insightful information in diagnosing extra 
      pulmonary disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of nested PCR (nPCR) in detecting the 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in blood samples of patients suspected of having 
      TB, in order to determine its potential for use as an auxiliary tool in the 
      laboratory diagnosis of TB in children. METHODS: Detection of the M. tuberculosis 
      complex in blood samples using as a target the insertion sequence IS6110 of the 
      genomic DNA of the bacillus. Blood samples of 120 patients were evaluated. All of 
      the patients were under 15 years of age at the time of their treatment at public 
      hospitals in the city of Recife, Brazil (between January of 2003 and August of 
      2005). Attending physicians at the hospitals diagnosed TB based on the criteria 
      recommended by the American Thoracic Society. The nPCR amplified a 123-bp fragment 
      with outer oligonucleotides (IS1/IS2) and, in the subsequent reaction, using inner 
      oligonucleotides (IS3/IS4), generating an 81-bp amplicon. RESULTS: Active or latent 
      TB was found in 65 patients, TB was ruled out in 28 suspected cases, and 27 patients 
      were TB-free (controls). The sensitivity of nPCR was 26.15% and was significantly 
      higher for the extrapulmonary form of the disease (55.56%) than for the pulmonary 
      form (18.18%). The specificity was 92.73%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the difficulties in 
      diagnosing TB in children and the low number of cases evaluated in the present 
      study, nPCR in blood samples proved to be a rapid and specific technique, albeit one 
      with low sensitivity. In order to establish its true usefulness in the diagnosis of 
      paucibacillary forms, especially extrapulmonary TB, further studies need to be 
      carried out with a larger sample of children and analyzing biological specimens 
      other than blood.

TI  - [The usefulness of in vitro interferon-gamma assay for differential diagnosis 
      between intestinal tuberculosis and Crohns disease].
PG  - 376-83
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is difficult to clinically and endoscopically differentiate 
      intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and Crohns disease (CD). The aim of this study was to 
      evaluate the usefulness of in vitro interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) assay for 
      differential diagnosis between ITB and CD. METHODS: Sixty patients for whom 
      differential diagnosis between ITB and CD was difficult were enrolled between 
      January 2007 and January 2009. The INF-gamma-producing T-cell response to early 
      secreted antigenic target 6 and culture filtrate protein 10 were measured by 
      T-SPOT.TB blood test in vitro. We evaluated the usefulness of T-SPOT.TB blood test 
      by comparing its results with the final diagnosis. RESULTS: Twenty and forty 
      patients were revealed to be positive and negative in T-SPOT.TB blood test, 
      respectively. Of the 20 patients found to be positive, 12 patients (60%) were 
      finally diagnosed as ITB, 6 patients as CD, and 2 patients as Behcets enterocolitis. 
      Of the 40 patients with negative results, 38 patients (95%) were diagnosed as CD; 
      one as Behcets enterocolitis; one as nonspecific colitis; none as ITB. The 
      sensitivity and specificity of T-SPOT.TB blood test for ITB were 100% and 83.3%, 
      respectively. Positive and negative predictive values of T-SPOT.TB blood test for 
      ITB were 60.0% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When differential diagnosis 
      between ITB and CD is difficult, T-SPOT.TB blood test may be a helpful and rapid 
      diagnostic tool to exclude ITB. Prospective large-scaled studies are required for 
      further evaluation of the usefulness of T-SPOT.TB blood test for differential 
      diagnosis between ITB and CD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) treatment takes a long time, and a gold standard test 
      to define TB cure is lacking. This may lead to early discharge of TB patients, 
      resulting in an increased risk of disease transmission and drug resistance. Plasma 
      lncRNAs might act as potential biomarkers to evaluate TB cure in an efficient and 
      precise manner. METHODS: A lncRNA microarray assay was used to screen differentially 
      expressed plasma lncRNAs in untreated TB and cured TB subjects. The expression 
      levels of lncRNAs were verified by qPCR. Target genes of lncRNAs were predicted 
      using a coding-non-coding gene co-expression network and mRNA-lncRNA-miRNA 
      interaction network analysis. RESULTS: The expression levels of lncRNAs uc.48+ (p < 
      0.001) and NR_105053 (p = 0.03) were found to differ significantly between the 
      untreated TB group and the cured TB group. The predicted target genes of uc.48+ were 
      EP300, BAI1 and NR_105053 were TLR9, MYD88, BAI1, respectively. A predictive model 
      for cured TB was established by the combination of uc.48+ and NR_105053 expression, 
      with a sensitivity of 90.00% and specificity of 86.36%, and an area under the curve 
      (AUC) value of 0.945. CONCLUSIONS: lncRNAs uc.48+ and NR_105053 may serve as 
      potential biomarkers to distinguish between untreated TB patients and cured TB 
      subjects. This study provides an experimental basis to evaluate the effect of TB 
      treatment and may also provide new clues to the pathological mechanisms of TB.

AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenesis mediator. Scant 
      reports are available defining the role of VEGF in active and inactive tubercular 
      meningitis (TBM) with no studies on brain tuberculoma. We quantified VEGF levels by 
      enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum in 20 cases 
      each with active and inactive TBM as well as 22 cases of intraparenchymal 
      tuberculoma. VEGF expression and microvessel angiogenesis quantification was done in 
      7 cases where tuberculomas were excised. Significantly increased VEGF levels in CSF 
      were found in active TBM cases (106.0+/-50.0 pg/ml) compared to inactive TBM cases 
      (14.7+/-10.0 pg/ml) (p<0.001). Mean serum VEGF levels in active TBM, inactive TBM 
      and tuberculoma were 694.93+/-820.66 pg/ml, 499.61+/-238.33 pg/ml and 541.0+/-389.0 
      pg/ml, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining of excised tuberculoma 
      demonstrated high expression of VEGF in granulomatous areas with intense positivity 
      in inflammatory mononuclear cells, Langhan's giant cells as well as reactive 
      astrocytes and fibrocytes. A strong positive correlation was observed between 
      microvessel density and VEGF expression. Serial decrease in serum VEGF levels was 
      observed with increasing duration of therapy in tuberculoma. We conclude that 
      increased CSF and serum VEGF levels are a measure of activity of the disease in 
      neurotuberculosis and its gradual decrease over a period of time is probably an 
      indicator of therapeutic response.

AB  - We applied a metabonomic strategy to identify host biomarkers in serum to diagnose 
      paediatric tuberculosis (TB) disease. 112 symptomatic children with presumptive TB 
      were recruited in The Gambia and classified as bacteriologically-confirmed TB, 
      clinically diagnosed TB, or other diseases. Sera were analysed using (1)H nuclear 
      magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS). Multivariate data 
      analysis was used to distinguish patients with TB from other diseases. Diagnostic 
      accuracy was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Model 
      performance was tested in a validation cohort of 36 children from the UK. Data 
      acquired using (1)H NMR demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity and Area Under the 
      Curve (AUC) of 69% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56-73%), 83% (95% CI, 73-93%), and 
      0.78 respectively, and correctly classified 20% of the validation cohort from the 
      UK. The most discriminatory MS data showed a sensitivity of 67% (95% CI, 60-71%), 
      specificity of 86% (95% CI, 75-93%) and an AUC of 0.78, correctly classifying 83% of 
      the validation cohort. Amongst children with presumptive TB, metabolic profiling of 
      sera distinguished bacteriologically-confirmed and clinical TB from other diseases. 
      This novel approach yielded a diagnostic performance for paediatric TB comparable to 
      that of Xpert MTB/RIF and interferon gamma release assays.

AB  - The detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antibodies in human sera has 
      been a rapid and important diagnostic aid for tuberculosis (TB) control and 
      prevention. However, any single antigen is not enough to be used to cover the 
      antibody profiles of all TB patients. In this study, a novel fusion protein was 
      constructed using gene splicing by overlap extension (SOEing), and then the antibody 
      level against it in 171 TB patients and 86 controls was evaluated by enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. Compared with the three individual antigen (16 kDa: sensitivity 
      19.9%, specificity 96.5%; MPT64: sensitivity 75.4%, specificity 34.9%; 38 kDa: 
      sensitivity 33.3%, specificity 83.7%), the fusion protein antigen (sensitivity 
      42.1%, specificity 89.5%) gave the best diagnostic performance with the largest 
      receiver operating characteristic curve area 0.656 (95% confidence interval [CI], 
      0.590-0.721; P<0.01). These results suggested that the novel fusion protein antigen 
      successfully constructed by gene SOEing provided the improved diagnostic performance 
      for TB, and other mycobacterial multiepitope fusion proteins may also be worthy of 
      investigation for further enhancing the detection sensitivity.

TI  - Diagnostic value of a nested polymerase chain reaction assay on peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells from patients with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - 754-62
AB  - SETTING: Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical 
      relevance of detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by nested polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the rapid diagnosis 
      of tuberculosis. DESIGN: Single-centre prospective case study of 90 hospitalised 
      patients and 50 healthy subjects or blood donors from 1 January to 30 June 1998. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis (26.7%); 20 
      tuberculosis patients were culture-positive, with seven smear-positive for acid-fast 
      bacilli. Sensitivity of smear, culture and nested PCR was 30.4 (7/23), 87 (20/23) 
      and 30.4% (7/23), respectively. The specificity of smear and culture was 100%, and 
      the specificity of the nested PCR was 96% in the healthy subjects. However, the 
      specificity decreased to 83.6% in the hospitalised patients, with 11 nested 
      PCR-positive patients without a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The sensitivity of the 
      nested PCR was low in pulmonary tuberculosis (22.2%), but increased in 
      pulmonary/extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (50%), extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (33%), 
      and disseminated tuberculosis (33%). CONCLUSION: The use of a nested PCR assay on 
      PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis with regard to low 
      sensitivity and specificity. However, further studies are needed to confirm this 
      technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of paucibacillary forms of 
      tuberculosis.

TI  - Rapid diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis by ligase chain reaction 
      amplification.
PG  - 1324-9
AB  - A rapid amplification-based test for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, 
      the LCx Mycobacterium tuberculosis Assay from Abbott Laboratories, was evaluated. 
      Results from the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay were compared with those from culture and 
      the final clinical diagnosis for each patient. A total of 526 nonrespiratory 
      specimens from 492 patients were tested. The specimens included urine; feces; lymph 
      node exudates; pleural, cerebrospinal, articular, and ascitic fluids; tissue 
      biopsies; gastric aspirates; purulent exudates; blood; and bone marrow aspirates. 
      After combination of the culture results and the patient's clinical data, a total of 
      135 specimens were collected from 122 patients with a diagnosis of extrapulmonary 
      tuberculosis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive 
      values for the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay were 77.7, 98.7, 95.2, and 93.1%, 
      respectively; these values rose in resolved cases of TB to 78.5, 100, 100, and 
      93.1%, respectively. For 37 (27.4%) specimens from patients smear positive for the 
      disease and 98 (72.6%) specimens from patients smear negative for the disease, the 
      sensitivities of the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay were 100 and 71.1%, respectively. 
      Statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) in sensitivities were found between 
      culture and the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay. These differences were even greater among 
      smear-negative specimens. The results demonstrate that the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay 
      will provide rapid and valuable information for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary 
      tuberculosis.

TI  - Mycobacterial antigens in pleural fluid mononuclear cells to diagnose pleural 
      tuberculosis in HIV co-infected patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extra pulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis (TB) accounts for 
      approximately one-half of TB cases in HIV-infected individuals with pleural TB as 
      the second most common location. Even though mycobacteria are cleared, mycobacterial 
      antigens may persist in infected tissues, causing sustained inflammation and 
      chronicity of the disease. The aim of this study was to explore various 
      mycobacterial antigens in pleural effusions, the impact of HIV infection and CD4+ 
      T-cell depletion on the presence of antigens, and the diagnostic potential of 
      antigens for improved and rapid diagnosis of pleural TB. METHODS: Pleural fluid 
      specimens were collected from patients presenting with clinically suspected pleural 
      TB, and processed routinely for culture, cytology, and adenosine deaminase activity 
      analysis. HIV status and CD4+ T-cell counts were recorded. Pleural fluid mononuclear 
      cells (PFMC) were isolated, and cell smears were stained with acid-fast staining and 
      immunocytochemistry for various mycobacterial antigens. Real-time and nested-PCR 
      were performed. Patients were categorized as pleural TB or non-TB cases using a 
      composite reference standard. Performance of the mycobacterial antigens as 
      diagnostic test was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were enrolled, of 
      which 32 were classified as pleural TB and 9 as non-TB. Thirteen patients had 
      culture confirmed pleural TB, 26 (81%) were HIV-TB co-infected, and 64% had < 100 
      CD4+ T-cells/microL. Both secreted and cell-wall mycobacterial antigens were 
      detected in PFMC. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) was the most frequently detected antigen. 
      There was no direct correlation between positive culture and antigens. Cases with 
      low CD4+ T-cell counts had higher bacterial and antigen burden. By combining 
      detection of secreted antigen or LAM, the sensitivity and specificity to diagnose 
      pleural TB was 56 and 78%, respectively, as compared to 41 and 100% for culture, 53 
      and 89% for nested PCR, and 6 and 100% for real-time PCR. CONCLUSION: Mycobacterial 
      antigens were detectable in PFMC from tuberculous pleural effusions, even in cases 
      where viable mycobacteria or bacterial DNA were not always detected. Thus, a 
      combination of secreted antigen and LAM detection by immunocytochemistry may be a 
      complement to acid-fast staining and contribute to rapid and accurate diagnosis of 
      pleural TB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteriological confirmation (BC) proportion among notified pulmonary TB 
      patients in China is among the lowest in the world. This study was to understand the 
      yield of BC using different testing strategies and patient-level factors associated 
      with BC among pulmonary TB patients in Tianjin, China during 2017-2018. METHODS: A 
      retrospective study was conducted, enrolling pulmonary TB patients reported to 
      National TB Information Management System (TBIMS) in Tianjin during 2017-2018. BC 
      was defined as a positive result by any of the followings: smear microscopy, 
      culture, or nucleic acid amplification test. Individual characteristics were 
      compared between patients with positive and negative bacteriological results using 
      contingency tables and χ(2) test. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to 
      analyze factors associated with BC, calculating adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI) (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Of 6364 reported patients, 4181 
      (65.7%) were bacteriologically confirmed. Positivity proportion was 43.1% 
      (2746/6364) for smear microscopy, 57.7% (3380/5853) for culture, 61.7% (1608/2605) 
      for Xpert® MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) and 73.4% (1824/2484) for combination of the three. 
      The unemployed (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-2.2) and farmers (aOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8) 
      compared with students; diagnosis by inpatient hospitals compared with TB clinics 
      (aOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 2.6-4.4); having symptoms for ≥2 weeks (aOR = 1.4, 95% CI: 
      1.1-1.8); cough (aOR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.8-2.8); blood sputum (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 
      1.0-2.2); cavitation on chest X-ray (aOR = 3.3, 95% CI: 2.5-4.3); bilateral lung 
      lobes affected (aOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.4-2.2) were factors associated with BC. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Combination test was an effective way to improve BC among pulmonary TB 
      patients. Being unemployed, farmers, having prolonged symptoms, and more severe in 
      TB condition were factors associated with BC. We recommend combination of tests to 
      improve BC for pulmonary TB patients, especially who are in early stage of the 
      disease or with conditions tend to be bacteriologically negative.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rising co-epidemic of tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) 
      is a challenge for constrained health systems in low and middle-income countries. 
      Diabetes is a known risk factor for tuberculosis and associated with poor 
      tuberculosis treatment outcomes, while tuberculosis is associated with worsening 
      glycemic control. We investigated the performance of bi-directional TB and DM case 
      finding approaches through a private-sector engagement model in Karachi, Pakistan. 
      METHODS: Between July 2016 and July 2018, private health care providers were engaged 
      to generate referrals for bi-directional TB and DM screening at private diagnostic 
      and treatment centers in Karachi, Pakistan. Individuals diagnosed with TB underwent 
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) testing at the time of anti-tuberculous treatment 
      initiation and at three -month follow up stage. All individuals with a history of 
      diabetes or random blood sugar of greater than 200 mg/dl were screened for TB using 
      a chest X-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF. RESULTS: A total of 6312 persons with tuberculosis 
      were tested on HbA1c at treatment initiation, of whom 1516 (24%) were newly 
      diagnosed with DM. About one third of those with HbA1c in the diabetic range (≥ 
      6.5%) at baseline were found to have a normal HbA1c (< 5.7%) result at 3-month 
      follow-up. A total of 3824 individuals with DM, of whom 2396 (63%) were known cases 
      and 1428 (37%) were newly identified with random blood sugar > 200 mg/dl, underwent 
      chest x-ray and Xpert MTB/RIF testing, with 321 (13.4%) known and 54 (3.8%) new 
      diabetics respectively identified with tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: This study 
      demonstrates a high yield of TB and DM through bidirectional screening and the 
      feasibility of engagement of private sector in finding missing cases of tuberculosis 
      and diabetes. Given the high prevalence of undiagnosed DM in individuals with TB 
      tuberculosis patients, there is a need to scale-up DM screening within TB 
      programmes. Increased awareness of the high risk of TB among individuals with DM is 
      needed among private health providers and screening for TB among diabetics should be 
      strongly considered.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the sensitivity and the specificity of the QuantiFERON-TB 
      Gold (QFT-G) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT) diagnostic tests for 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. METHODS: One-hundred patients with culture 
      and/or PCR confirmed M. tuberculosis infection and 168 volunteers with no risk 
      factors for M. tuberculosis infection were tested to estimate sensitivity and 
      specificity, respectively. RESULTS: Analysis of data from the tuberculosis (TB) 
      patients with valid results found the sensitivity of QFT-GIT (92.6%, 87/94) to be 
      significantly higher than that for the QFT-G test (81.4%, 79/97; p=0.023). The 
      specificity of both QFT-GIT and QFT-G was 98.8% (CI: 95.1%-99.8%) with 2 of the 160 
      low risk subjects with valid results for both tests being positive. Data analysis 
      confirmed the manufacturer's recommended test cut-off as being optimal, but 
      identified higher sensitivity could be obtained by using a lower cut-off, with only 
      a moderate decrease in specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The QFT-GIT test had enhanced 
      sensitivity for detection of M. tuberculosis infection over the QFT-G test, whilst 
      maintaining equivalent high specificity. The logistic benefits of the QFT-GIT test 
      format, as well as its higher sensitivity, should enable enhanced TB control.

AB  - Tuberculosis of free-ranging and captive wildlife, including species implicated in 
      the maintenance and transmission of Mycobacterium bovis, is a difficult disease to 
      diagnose and control. Historically, diagnosis of tuberculosis has relied largely 
      upon assays of cell-mediated immunity (CMI), such as tuberculin skin testing. This 
      approach, however, is problematic or impractical for use with many wildlife species. 
      Increasingly, in vitro diagnostic tests, including gamma interferon 
      (IFN-gamma)-based assays, are replacing or complementing skin testing of cattle and 
      humans. Analogous assays are unavailable for most wildlife because of a lack of 
      species-specific immunological reagents. This report describes the development and 
      validation of a whole-blood assay to quantify antigen-specific IFN-gamma mRNA 
      expression by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Oligonucleotide 
      primers and probes were designed and tested for reactivity towards several 
      susceptible species of interest with respect to tuberculosis infection. The assay 
      was subsequently optimized to quantify the IFN-gamma mRNA expression in elk and red 
      deer (Cervus elaphus) and was evaluated for its ability to detect mycobacterial 
      antigen-specific responses of experimentally tuberculosis-infected animals. The 
      assay was a simple, rapid, and sensitive measure of antigen-specific CMI. The 
      IFN-gamma mRNA responses correlated well with IFN-gamma protein production and 
      showed performance in determining an animal's infection status superior to that of 
      either lymphocyte proliferation or IFN-gamma protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay methods. An additional advantage is the ease with which the assay can be 
      modified to reliably quantify IFN-gamma expression by using consensus sequences of 
      closely related species or of other species for which IFN-gamma sequence information 
      is available.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are limited reports on the influence of the immune regulatory 
      genotypes on the efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in man. This study was 
      designed to evaluate the influence of the cytokine genotype interferon (IFN)-gamma 
      +874T/A on T cell in vitro assays in BCG nonresponders (negative to either in vivo 
      or in vitro test with purified protein derivative or both). METHODS: Ninety healthy 
      children who were without any clinical evidence of the disease, 45 with a BCG-scar 
      and the remaining 45 without scar were assessed for in vitro T cell responses. CD4+ 
      and CD8+ cell counts were measured by flow cytometry. r32kDaBCG (Ag85A-BCG) protein 
      was used to stimulate T cells and IFN-gamma cytokine concentration in the cultures 
      were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Polymorphism in IFN-gamma 
      (+874T/A) region was detected by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase 
      chain reaction. RESULTS: T cell subsets were within the normal range in all 
      subjects. Children with TT genotype showed significantly higher antigen-induced 
      IFN-gamma (P < 0.001) as compared with those with AT/AA genotype. The highest values 
      were observed in children with TT genotype combined with positive antigen-specific 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells proliferation. Seventy-five percent of the 
      vaccinated children with TT genotype showed high amounts of stimulated IFN-gamma 
      compared with 66% of scar negative and 16% of scar positive but with AA genotype. 
      CONCLUSIONS: IFN-gamma (+874T/A) polymorphism seemed to be a strong and independent 
      predictor for clinical outcome of both scar-positive and scar-negative children. 
      These results may help in planning future vaccination strategies. The ability to 
      mount in vitro lymphoproliferation did not distinguish the success or failure of BCG 
      vaccination nor predict susceptibility to the disease.

      of patients with tuberculous pleural effusion and its clinical implications].
PG  - 1543-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the level of soluble programmed death ligand 1 (sPD-L1) in 
      pleural effusion and peripheral blood of patients with tuberculous pleural effusion 
      (TPE) and elucidate its clinical implications. METHODS: Patients with newly 
      diagnosed pleural effusion at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University 
      from June 2012 to March 2013 were enrolled and divided into 3 groups of TPE, 
      malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and non-tuberculous non-malignant pleural effusion 
      (non-TPE non-MPE) according to the nature of pleural effusion. The level of sPD-L1 
      in pleural effusion and peripheral blood was analyzed by enzyme linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) kit. Flow cytometry was used to detect the changes of immune cell 
      subsets in pleural effusion. And the gene expressions of programmed death ligand 1 
      (PD-L1) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) were detected in different effusions 
      by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: A total of 77 
      newly diagnosed patients with pleural effusion were enrolled, 24 patients with TPE, 
      39 patients with MPE, 14 patients with non-TPE non-MPE. The level of sPD-L1 in TPE 
      was higher than that in MPE and non-TPE non-MPE (4.2 (2.6-6.3), 1.4 (0.8-2.1), 1.8 
      (1.2-2.6) µg/L, P < 0.001). No significant difference existed in the levels of 
      sPD-L1 in peripheral blood samples (P = 0.811). The average content of sPD-L1 in 
      pleural effusion in all patients was statistically higher than that in peripheral 
      blood (2.0 (1.4-3.7), 1.5 (1.0-2.0) µg/L, P = 0.004). The proportion of CD8 subset, 
      PD-L1 on CD14(+) monocytes and the mRNA level of PD-L1, MMP-3 in TPE were higher 
      than in MPE and non-TPE non-MPE (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001), and the mRNA 
      level of PD-L1 in TPE was positively correlated with the level of MMP-3 (r = 0.887, 
      P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that 
      sPD-L1 had a sensitivity of 82.6%, a specificity of 83.8% and an area under curve 
      (AUC) of 0.854 for differential diagnosis of TPE from other conditions. Combinations 
      of sPD-L1, PD-L1 on CD14(+) monocytes and adenosine deaminase (ADA) measurements 
      further increased the sensitivity up to 91.3%, specificity up to 89.2% and AUC up to 
      0.989. CONCLUSION: The elevated expression of sPD-L1 in tuberculous pleural effusion 
      may aid the diagnosis of TPE.

TI  - Comparison of 2 interferon-gamma assays and Roche Cobas Amplicor Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis assay for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis among patients with suspected 
      tuberculosis in Taiwan.
PG  - 251-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Two commercial interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) assays, which 
      are commonly used for diagnosing latent tuberculosis (TB), are also useful for 
      diagnosis of active TB. In this study, the IFN-gamma assays and polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of TB were compared. METHODS: A prospective comparison 
      of the performance of 2 commercial IFN-gamma assays - QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) 
      and T-SPOT.TB (T SPOT) - and PCR using the Roche Cobas Amplicor Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (RCA-TB) assay for the rapid diagnosis of TB was conducted from January 
      2007 to December 2007 at a university-affiliated hospital in Taiwan. RESULTS: Of 187 
      patients enrolled in the study, results from both T SPOT and QFT-G were available 
      for 154, including 109 patients with active TB and 45 with no TB. The sensitivity of 
      T SPOT (89.0%) was higher than that of QFT-G (71.4%). RCA-TB had the highest 
      sensitivity (90.2%) and specificity (100%), but was usually performed in patients 
      with positive acid-fast bacilli smear test. In patients with extrapulmonary TB, T 
      SPOT had a high diagnostic value (sensitivity, 81.3%). A significant discordance 
      between the 2 IFN-gamma assays was also noted. IFN-gamma assays provided a more 
      rapid diagnosis for tuberculosis than the conventional culture method (mean +/- 
      standard deviation, 8.23 +/- 12.86 days; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of IFN-gamma 
      may shorten the time to diagnosis of TB, especially for smear-negative patients and 
      those with extrapulmonary disease.

TI  - Identification of Mycobacterium shimoidei by molecular techniques: case report and 
      summary of the literature.
PG  - 169-73
AB  - A 53-year-old woman from Melbourne, Australia, with squamous cell carcinoma of the 
      oesophagus was shown by computed tomography (CT) scan to have a left apical cavity 
      and inflammatory changes in the right lung consistent with aspiration. Acid-fast 
      bacilli isolated from bronchial washings were identified biochemically first as 
      Mycobacterium terrae, but later as M. shimoidei on the basis of 1) restriction 
      fragment analysis and 2) sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified 16S 
      rDNA. Nine other descriptions of patients with M. shimoidei isolates were collated. 
      The salient feature of isolates considered to be pathogenic was pulmonary 
      cavitation. Most patients had underlying lung disease, including past tuberculosis 
      or malignancy. Six of eight patients died of progressive respiratory illness, 
      although the contribution of M. shimoidei was not always clear, and two patients 
      improved. One patient with the acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS) died with 
      Salmonella enteritidis and M. shimoidei isolated from blood cultures. One isolate 
      was regarded as a coloniser. There are insufficient clinical or sensitivity data on 
      which to base recommendations for therapy, but a combination of ethambutol, 
      rifabutin and pyrazinamide could be considered.

TI  - Src homology 3-interacting domain of Rv1917c of Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces 
      selective maturation of human dendritic cells by regulating PI3K-MAPK-NF-kappaB 
      signaling and drives Th2 immune responses.
PG  - 36511-22

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an etiological agent of pulmonary tuberculosis, causes 
      significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pathogenic mycobacteria survive in 
      the host by subverting host innate immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional 
      antigen-presenting cells that are vital for eliciting immune responses to infectious 
      agents, including pathogenic mycobacteria. DCs orchestrate distinct Th responses 
      based on the signals they receive. In this perspective, deciphering the interactions 
      of the proline-glutamic acid/proline-proline-glutamic acid (PE/PPE) family of 
      proteins of M. tuberculosis with DCs assumes significant pathophysiological 
      attributes. In this study, we demonstrate that Rv1917c (PPE34), a representative 
      member of the proline-proline-glutamic-major polymorphic tandem repeat family, 
      interacts with TLR2 and triggers functional maturation of human DCs. Signaling 
      perturbations implicated a critical role for integrated cross-talk among PI3K-MAPK 
      and NF-κB signaling cascades in Rv1917c-induced maturation of DCs. However, this 
      maturation of DCs was associated with a secretion of high amounts of 
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, whereas Th1-polarizing cytokine IL-12 was not 
      induced. Consistent with these results, Rv1917c-matured DCs favored secretion of 
      IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 from CD4(+) T cells and contributed to Th2-skewed cytokine 
      balance ex vivo in healthy individuals and in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. 
      Interestingly, the Rv1917c-skewed Th2 immune response involved induced expression of 
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in DCs. Taken together, these results indicate that Rv1917c 
      facilitates a shift in the ensuing immunity toward the Th2 phenotype and could aid 
      in immune evasion by mycobacteria.

TI  - Hemophagocytic syndrome associated with Mycobacterium bovis in a patient with 
      X-SCID: a case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium bovis could infect patients with immunodeficiency or 
      immunosuppressive conditions via Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination. 
      Tuberculosis-related hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is reported, but not HPS caused 
      by Mycobacterium bovis in children. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-month Chinese boy 
      presented fever and cough. The initial laboratory investigation showed the 
      lymphocyte count of 0.97 × 10(9)/L, which decreased gradually. HPS was diagnosed 
      based on the test results that fulfilled the HLH-2004 criteria. In addition, 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was detected from his peripheral blood via 
      metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and M. bovis was identified by 
      polymerase chain reaction-reverse dot blot (PCR-RDB). Thus, the patient was treated 
      with Isoniazid, Rifampin, and Pyrazinamide, but not improved. However, parents 
      refused to accept further therapy, and was discharged on the day 12 of admission. To 
      confirm the pathogenesis, genetic analysis was performed. Mutation in the 
      interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma gene: Exon 6: c.854G > A; p. Arg285Gln was 
      detected in the patient and the mother, which could underlie X-linked severe 
      combined immunodeficiency. CONCLUSIONS: A boy with X-SCID was diagnosed with M. 
      bovis-associated HPS, emphasizing that X-SCID should be considered when M. bovis is 
      detected in a male infant with low lymphocyte counts.

TI  - Evaluation of a nested PCR targeting IS6110 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 
      detection of the organism in the leukocyte fraction of blood samples.

AB  - PURPOSE: Tuberculosis poses a serious health problem in resource-poor settings such 
      as India. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is presently seen as a promising 
      alternative to conventional smear microscopy and culture techniques. Undiagnosed 
      fever is a condition where the aetiology could include tuberculosis in a significant 
      percentage. This paper evaluates a nested PCR (nPCR) using Hotstar Taq for the 
      detection of M. tuberculosis in patients with febrile illness using insertion 
      element, IS6110 as a target. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 355 samples (301 HIV 
      status unknown and 54 HIV seropositives) from patients primarily with febrile 
      illness were tested for the presence of M. tuberculosis. Blood culture was done in a 
      commercial automated blood culture system and nPCR in DNA extracts from buffy coat 
      samples. Hotstar Taq polymerase was used to enhance the sensitivity of nPCR and the 
      lower limit of detection was determined by using cloned plasmid. RESULTS: Among the 
      patients tested, 2% were positive by automated culture system and 6.8% of patients 
      were positive by nPCR. Majority of the positives were from HIV seropositive 
      individuals. The sensitivity of the nPCR was 100% and the specificity was 95.1%. The 
      lower limit of detection was less than 1 genome copy per microlitre. Among the nPCR 
      positives, patients from rural community were significantly higher than from the 
      peri-urban community. CONCLUSIONS: The nPCR had a high sensitivity and specificity 
      on buffy coat samples using Hotstar Taq polymerase in the reaction mix. Thus the 
      technique is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

AB  - Combining a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test with bronchoscopy is frequently 
      performed to allow a rapid diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). 
      However, limited data are available concerning clinical judgment in patients with 
      suspected PTB and AFB smear- and PCR-negative bronchial aspirates (BA). The present 
      study evaluated the usefulness of whole-blood QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) 
      testing in these patients. Of 166 patients with suspected PTB who had undergone 
      bronchoscopy because of smear-negative sputum or inadequate sputum production, 93 
      (56%) were diagnosed with culture-positive PTB. Seventy-four patients were either 
      AFB smear- or PCR-positive. In the 75 patients whose BA AFB smear and PCR results 
      were both negative, 19 were finally diagnosed with PTB by culture. The QFT test had 
      a negative predictive value of 91% for PTB. The QFT test may be useful for excluding 
      PTB in patients with suspected PTB whose BA AFB smear and PCR results are both 
      negative.

TI  - Detection of hepatitis B virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Korean dental 
      patients.
PG  - 239-42
AB  - This study examined the detection rate of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in serum and saliva samples, respectively, from 120 
      dental patients who were unaware if they have or had either hepatitis or 
      tuberculosis. The frequencies of HBsAg and anti-HBs were determined using an 
      immunochromatic assay. Mtb positivity was determined by the PCR method. Of the 120 
      patients, 7 (5.8%) were HBV positive and 30 (25.0%) were Mtb positive. This 
      highlights the fact that dental health care workers (DHCWs) can be exposed to the 
      risk of infection from blood- or saliva-borne pathogens as a consequence of their 
      work. Therefore, it is very important to prevent cross infection between patients 
      and dental personnel. Accordingly, laboratory tests prior to surgical treatment are 
      needed to determine the infectious state of dental patients in order to prevent the 
      transmission of infectious diseases in dental clinics.

TI  - Individual animals of a cattle herd infected with the same Mycobacterium bovis 
      genotype shows important variations in bacteriological, histopathological and immune 
      response parameters.
PG  - 86-93
AB  - Cattle are the host and main reservoir of the etiologic agent of bovine 
      tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis; although other mammalian species, including 
      humans, are susceptible. The tuberculin test and/or slaughterhouse surveillance is 
      the diagnostic method used by control programs all around the world to control and 
      eradicate the disease. In order to compare different tuberculosis diagnostic tests 
      and to reach disease confirmation, a study was performed in a group of 14 steers of 
      Friesian breed, reacting positively to tuberculin test. Three ante-mortem assays 
      were performed according to the type of sample: the gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) 
      test (which quantifies the release of this cytokine by sensitized lymphocytes in 
      whole blood in response to purified protein derivative (PPD) and recombinant ESAT-6 
      and CFP10 proteins); PCR and bacteriologic culture from nasal swab and intradermal 
      tuberculin test. These assays were taken at different times to assess the evolution 
      of clinical parameters. Post-mortem examination showed macroscopic and microscopic 
      tuberculosis lesions with acid-fast bacillus and positive cultures. By 
      spoligotyping, we observed that all the isolates showed the same pattern. The 
      positive results based on comparison to lesions observed ranged from 58% to 75% for 
      the IFN-gamma assays, to 72% for cultures, and ranged from 50% to 90% for PCR in 
      nasal swabs. In conclusion, in a herd infected by the same strain, ante-mortem 
      direct and immune-diagnostic parameters change, suggesting that several tests are 
      needed for a faster control of infection at herd level.

TI  - Cellular immune response in atypical tuberculosis diagnosed by PCR in paraffin 
      embedded material.
PG  - 63-72
AB  - The aim was to evaluate the cellular immune response in atypical tuberculosis and 
      granulomatous inflammation consistent with tuberculosis (TBC), negative 
      histochemically for acid-fast bacilli and analysed by PCR for Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (MT) detection in paraffin-embedded tissue. Thirty six samples of 
      differently localized atypical tuberculous lesions and granulomatous tuberculoid 
      lesions negative for acid fast bacilli and 4 positive cases on Ziehl-Nielsen stain 
      were analysed by PCR for MT detection and were tested immunohistochemically (IHC) 
      for the cellular immune response in the granulomas and perigranulomatous tissue. The 
      samples selected were: 7 pulmonary and 33 extrapulmonary specimens, especially lymph 
      nodes. Histologically, the atypical tuberculous lesions contained supurative 
      necrosis, defective granulomas and cellular polymorphism. The epithelioid cells 
      showed frequent mitoses. The immunoprofile of cells was polymorphous. L26 positive 
      small lymphocytes were found in nodular lymphoid aggregates surrounding granulomas. 
      A significantly increased number of positive UCHL1 cells were found in 33 out of the 
      40 analysed cases, with a larger percentage of CD4 positive T cells (81.8% of 
      cases). CD44 was positive in multinucleated giant cells (17.5% of cases), 
      epithelioid cells (60% of cases) and lymphocytes (30% of cases). CD68 was localized 
      in multinucleated giant cells and epithelioid cells, in a 4%, respectively 62.5% of 
      cases. The PCR was performed in all 40 cases; the tissue samples were heterogeneous 
      (lung, lymph nodes, lever, nasopharynx, etc.) and needed a good quality extraction 
      of DNA. Performing a control PCR for Beta Globin tested the extraction; a good 
      result was obtained in 31 cases (77.5%); from these, 19 cases had amplification for 
      IS 6110. The cellular immune response in the atypical tuberculous lesions was 
      similar in cases with and without acid-fast bacilli, but positive for PCR. In the 
      most cases with negative PCR reaction, it was due to a deficient fixation of the 
      material. The T lymphocytes were numerous in all types of tuberculous granulomas, 
      with the prominence of CD4 positive subtype. The immunoprofile of the epithelioid 
      cells, positive for CD44 and CD68, presenting frequently mitoses suggests an 
      activate state in a possible relationship to the T-cell-mediated immune response in 
      tuberculosis.

TI  - Development and evaluation of a test for tuberculosis in live European badgers 
      (Meles meles) based on measurement of gamma interferon mRNA by real-time PCR.
PG  - 2398-403
AB  - A real-time PCR assay for the measurement of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) mRNA in 
      European badger (Meles meles) blood cultures was developed. The levels of IFN-gamma 
      mRNA in blood cultures stimulated with either bovine or avian tuberculin or specific 
      mycobacterial antigens were compared with those in a nonstimulated control blood 
      culture as the basis for determining the tuberculosis (TB) status of live badgers. 
      The assay was validated by testing 247 animals for which there were matching data 
      from postmortem examination and culture of tissues. Relative changes in the levels 
      of IFN-gamma mRNA in response to bovine tuberculin and specific antigens were found 
      to be greater among badgers with tissues positive for TB on culture. The test was at 
      its most accurate (87% of test results were correct) by using blood cultures 
      containing bovine tuberculin as the antigen and when the response to avian 
      tuberculin was taken into account by subtracting the avian tuberculin response from 
      the bovine tuberculin response. At a specificity of 90.7%, the test was 70.6% 
      sensitive. At the same specificity, the current serological enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay for TB in badgers was only 53% sensitive. This work demonstrates 
      that measurement of IFN-gamma mRNA by real-time PCR is a valid method for the 
      detection of TB in live badgers and may provide an alternative to the current 
      serological methods of diagnosis, the Brock test. The testing procedure can be 
      completed within 5 h of receipt of the blood culture samples. In addition, the use 
      of a molecular biology-based test offers the potential to fully automate the testing 
      procedure through the use of robotics.

TI  - Gene-expression patterns in whole blood identify subjects at risk for recurrent 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 357-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of patients with tuberculosis who comply with appropriate 
      treatment are cured. However, approximately 5% subsequently have a repeat disease 
      episode, usually within 2 years of successful combination therapy. Presently, there 
      is no way of predicting which patients will experience a relapse. METHODS: We 
      identified 10 subjects who had previously experienced recurrent tuberculosis and 
      carefully matched them to cured subjects who had had only 1 episode of tuberculosis, 
      to patients with active tuberculosis, and to latently infected healthy subjects. We 
      compared their ex vivo whole-blood gene-expression profiles by use of DNA array 
      technology and confirmed the results by use of quantitative reverse-transcriptase 
      polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: The 4 clinical tuberculosis groups 
      exhibited distinct patterns of gene expression. The gene-transcript profiles of the 
      patients with recurrent tuberculosis were more similar to those of the patients with 
      active tuberculosis than to those of the cured or latently infected subjects. 
      Discriminant analysis of a training data set showed that 9 genes were sufficient to 
      classify the subjects. We confirmed that measurement of the expression of these 
      genes by qRT-PCR can accurately discriminate between subjects in a test set of 
      samples. CONCLUSIONS: A simple test based on gene-expression patterns may be used as 
      a biomarker of cure while identifying patients who are at risk for relapse. This 
      would facilitate the introduction of new tuberculosis drugs.

      extrapulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - 182-7
LID - 10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2008.10.013 [doi]
AB  - The whole-blood interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (QuantiFERON-TB 
      Gold [QFT-G]; Cellestis, Carnegie, Australia) has been studied mainly for diagnosing 
      active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) or latent TB. We prospectively evaluated its 
      diagnostic usefulness in patients suspected with extrapulmonary TB (EP-TB). Of the 
      100 adult patients with suspected EP-TB, 43 were classified as "confirmed" EP-TB and 
      5 as "probable" EP-TB. Of the 48 with EP-TB, 27 (56%) were diagnosed with TB 
      lymphadenitis and 11 (17%) with skeletal TB. The overall sensitivity and specificity 
      of the assay were 69% (95% confidence interval [CI(95)], 53-81%) and 82% (CI(95), 
      69-91%), respectively. Among 44 patients presented with cervical lymphadenopathy, 
      the QFT-G assay showed 86% (CI(95), 64-97%) sensitivity and 87% (CI(95), 66-97%) 
      specificity, whereas in 28 with skeletal involvement, the sensitivity and 
      specificity of the assay were 45% (CI(95), 17-77%) and 81% (CI(95), 54-96%), 
      respectively. These suboptimal diagnostic performances suggest that the QFT-G assay 
      alone is not sufficient for the diagnosis of EP-TB.

TI  - Childhood tuberculosis and its early diagnosis.
PG  - 450-5
AB  - Traditional methods for laboratory diagnosis of tuberculosis are unsatisfactory, 
      especially for children, in whose specimens mycobacteria are usually sparse. Recent 
      changes in tuberculosis epidemiology in developed countries, including a large 
      increase in incidence in children from certain ethnic minorities, have prompted 
      interest in newer diagnostic methods. Liquid-based culture detection systems offer 
      improved sensitivity and speed of diagnosis, although the time taken for detection 
      of growth is still upwards of 1 week. Nucleic acid amplification techniques offer 
      more rapid results, but perform best on smear-positive samples; sensitivities may be 
      as low as 50% in smear-negative specimens. Although these newer techniques are 
      widely used in some developed countries, in others, they are not perceived as 
      offering sufficient benefit to justify their routine use. The diagnostic accuracy of 
      mycobacteriophage and serologic methods is insufficient to justify their wide use 
      even in developing countries. Despite recent developments, there is still no panacea 
      for diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis.

AB  - Conventional and updated medical technologies of detecting M. tuberculosis (MT) and 
      tuberculosis antibodies (TAB) were compared. It is shown that molecular-biological 
      and immunological methods can be used only in rapid diagnosis and screening. They 
      should be followed by further examinations as urine MT makers and blood TAB are not 
      criteria for final diagnosis of renal tuberculosis. Routine microbiological methods 
      are most precise in the above diagnosis. Diagnosis of initial forms of renal 
      tuberculosis is still unsolved problem. Low professional skills of outpatient 
      service urologists in the field of urogenital tuberculosis explain late detection of 
      urinary tuberculosis.

TI  - [Current course of pneumocystic pneumonia in HIV-infected patients].
PG  - 19-24
AB  - AIM: To describe clinical and laboratory characteristics of pneumocystic pneumonia 
      (PP) in patients with HIV-infection for improvement of diagnosis quality. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: Detailed examination was performed in 111 HIV-infected patients with 
      suggested diagnosis of PP. The following investigations were made: clinical, x-ray 
      examinations, total count and biochemical blood tests, enzyme immunoassay, indirect 
      immunofluorescence reaction (II-FR) for Pneumocystis jiroveci antigens in 
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or induced sputum. For diagnosis of other 
      secondary diseases PCR was used for investigation of BALF and bronchial biopsy to 
      detect DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Candida albicans, Cytomegalovirus, 
      Toxoplasma gondii, Mycoplasma spa., Herpes simplex I, II. DNA of cytomegalovirus in 
      blood was detected with PCR. Microscopic tests of the sputum were conducted for 
      detection of acid-resistant mycobacteria. RESULTS: PP was associated with other 
      secondary diseases in 59% patients (pulmonary tuberculosis ---16%, CMV 
      pneumonia--31%, combination of all the lesions--5%). PP diagnosis was cancelled and 
      pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 12 patients. In combination of PP with other 
      pathology dominant were symptoms observed in PP monoinfection and only effective 
      anti-pneumocystic treatment revealed signs of comorbid pathology. Tuberculosis 
      patients had weaker signs of respiratory failure, symmetric bilateral interstitial 
      or small-focal alterations were detected less frequently. CONCLUSION: Current PP 
      course characteristics in HIV infection are identified. In clinical diagnosis of PP 
      special attention should be paid to data complex especially to increasing

TI  - Ras-associated small GTPase 33A, a novel T cell factor, is down-regulated in 
      patients with tuberculosis.
PG  - 1211-8
AB  - Ras-associated small GTPases (Rabs) are specific regulators of intracellular vesicle 
      trafficking. Interference with host cell vesicular transport is a hallmark of many 
      intracellular pathogens, including the notable example Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
      We performed, by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, gene-expression analyses 
      for selected Rab molecules in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from patients with 
      tuberculosis (TB) and healthy control subjects, to identify candidate genes that are 
      critically involved in the host immune response. Comparison revealed significant 
      differences in the expression of genes for Rab13, Rab24, and Rab33A. Rab33A gene 
      expression was down-regulated in patients with TB and was predominantly expressed in 
      CD8+ T cells. We excluded possible influences of differences in T cell percentages 
      between the 2 study groups, demonstrating that Rab33A gene expression changes on the 
      single-cell level. In vitro, Rab33A RNA expression was induced in T cells on 
      activation and by dendritic cells infected with M. tuberculosis. Our findings 
      identify Rab33A as a T cell regulatory molecule in TB and suggest its involvement in 
      disease processes.

TI  - Toll-like receptor 9 is required for full host resistance to Mycobacterium avium 
      infection but plays no role in induction of Th1 responses.
PG  - 1638-46
LID - 10.1128/IAI.01030-10 [doi]
AB  - To investigate the role of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in innate immunity to 
      Mycobacterium avium, TLR9, TLR2, and MyD88 knockout (KO) mice were infected with 
      this bacterium. Bacterial burdens were higher in the spleens, livers, and lungs of 
      infected TLR9 KO mice than in those of C57BL/6 mice, indicating that TLR9 is 
      required for efficient control of M. avium infection. However, TLR9 KO or TLR2 KO 
      spleen cells displayed normal M. avium-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) 
      and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) responses. This finding was confirmed by determining 
      the number of splenic CD4(+) T cells producing IFN-γ by flow cytometry. Furthermore, 
      TLR2 and MyD88, but not TLR9, played a major role in interleukin-12 and TNF-α 
      production by M. avium-infected macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). We also found 
      that major histocompatibility complex class II molecule expression on DCs is 
      regulated by TLR2 and MyD88 signaling but not by TLR9. Finally, lack of TLR9, TLR2, 
      or MyD88 reduced the numbers of macrophages, epithelioid cells, and lymphocytes in 
      M. avium-induced granulomas but only MyD88 deficiency affected the number of liver 
      granulomas. In summary, our data demonstrated that the involvement of TLR9 in the 
      control of M. avium infection is not related to the induction of Th1 responses.

TI  - CD8+ DC, but Not CD8(-)DC, isolated from BCG-infected mice reduces pathological 
      reactions induced by mycobacterial challenge infection.
PG  - e9281
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0009281 [doi]
LID - e9281
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is a mycobacterial infection causing worldwide public 
      health problems but the available vaccine is far from ideal. Type-1 T cell immunity 
      has been shown to be critical for host defence against tuberculosis infection, but 
      the role of dendritic cell (DC) subsets in pathogenesis of mycobacterial infection 
      remains unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the effectiveness of 
      dendritic cell (DC) subsets in BCG-infected mice in generating immune responses 
      beneficial for pathogen clearance and reduction of pathological reactions in the 
      tissues following challenge infection. Our data showed that only the adoptive 
      transfer of the subset of CD8alpha+ DC isolated from infected mice (iCD8+ DC) 
      generated significant protection, demonstrated by less mycobacterial growth and 
      pathological changes in the lung and liver tissues in iCD8+ DC recipients than 
      sham-treated control mice. The adoptive transfer of the CD8alpha(-)DC from the 
      infected mice (iCD8(-) DC) not only failed to reduce bacterial growth, but enhanced 
      inflammation characterized by diffuse heavy cellular infiltration. Notably, iCD8(-) 
      DC produced significantly higher levels of IL-10 than iCD8+ DC and promoted more Th2 
      cytokine responses in in vitro DC-T cell co-culture and in vivo adoptive transfer 
      experiments. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The data indicate that in vivo BCG-primed 
      CD8+ DC is the dominant DC subset in inducing protective immunity especially for 
      reducing pathological reactions in infected tissues. The finding has implications 
      for the rational improvement of the prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for 
      controlling tuberculosis infection and related diseases.

TI  - Mediator responses of alveolar macrophages and kinetics of mononuclear phagocyte 
      subset recruitment during acute primary and secondary mycobacterial infections in 
      the lungs of mice.
PG  - 738-52
AB  - Little is known about the activation programme induced in alveolar macrophages upon 
      phagocytosis of mycobacteria and the concomitant mononuclear phagocyte migratory 
      responses that shape the acute phase of mycobacterial infection. Using high-speed 
      cell sorting in conjunction with real-time RT-PCR analysis, we show that sorted 
      alveolar macrophages of transgenic CX3CR1+/GFP mice infected with red 
      fluorescent-labelled Mycobacterium bovis BCG exhibited weak transcriptional changes 
      of lysosomal cathepsins B, L, D, K and S, whereas antimicrobial cathepsin G was 
      strongly induced upon infection. Moreover, mRNA levels of pattern recognition 
      receptors TLR2, TLR4 and NOD2 were downregulated as were neutrophil chemoattractants 
      KC, MIP-2 and IP-10, whereas highly upregulated mRNA levels of the monocyte 
      chemoattractant CCL2 were observed. M. bovis BCG infection of the mice elicited the 
      alveolar accumulation of highly CX3CR1-positive alveolar dendritic cells but not 
      neutrophils within the alveolar compartment, whereas no increased accumulation of 
      CX3CR1high lung parenchymal dendritic cells (lung DC) or CX3CR1neg lung macrophages 
      compared with controls was noted. In contrast, CX3CR1+/GFP mice previously immunized 
      with M. bovis BCG rapidly responded with increased accumulations of both CX3CR1high 
      alveolar and lung parenchymal DC and CX3CR1neg lung macrophages upon intratracheal 
      M. bovis BCG challenge. Moreover, alveolar and lung macrophages and lung DC were 
      found to contribute to early uptake of M. bovis BCG. Together, acute mycobacterial 
      infection triggers both rapid changes in gene expression profiles in infected 
      alveolar macrophages and a compartment-specific accumulation of mononuclear 
      phagocyte subsets contributing to M. bovis BCG uptake in vivo.

TI  - Is the gamma interferon assay in cattle influenced by multiple tuberculin 
      injections?
PG  - 270-4
AB  - Along with other developed countries, Canada is interested in adopting the gamma 
      interferon (IFN-gamma) assay to test for bovine tuberculosis (TB). This study 
      compared results of using the IFN-gamma assay in a large number of field-tested 
      cattle in Manitoba, some previously tested with a caudal fold test (CFT) only, and 
      others injected with tuberculins for both a CFT and a comparative cervical test 
      (CCT). Parallel testing further compared the IFN-gamma assay and CCT results with 
      the confirmed TB status of the animal (culture, histopathologic examination, 
      polymerase chain reaction). Results from IFN-gamma assays did not differ following 
      the CFT versus CFT and CCT injections. Parallel testing demonstrated an apparent 
      higher prevalence of tuberculosis for the IFN-gamma assay versus CCT, which will 
      assist in earlier removal of exposed animals and, ultimately, prevent populations 
      from becoming infected.

TI  - Modified immunohistological staining allows detection of Ziehl-Neelsen-negative 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms and their precise localization in human tissue.
PG  - 633-40
AB  - The diagnosis of mycobacterial infection depends on the Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain, 
      which detects mycobacteria because of their characteristic acid-fast cell wall 
      composition and structure. The histological diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) comprises 
      various aspects: (1) sensitive detection of mycobacteria; (2) precise localization 
      of mycobacteria in the context of granulomatous lesions; (3) 'staging' of disease 
      according to mycobacterial spread and granulomatous tissue integrity. Thus, 
      detection of minute numbers of acid-fast bacteria in tissue specimens is critical. 
      The conventional ZN stain fails to identify mycobacteria in numbers less than 10(4) 
      per ml. Hence many infections evade diagnosis. PCR is highly sensitive, but allows 
      neither localization within tissues nor staging of mycobacterial disease, and 
      positive findings frequently do not correlate with disease. In this study, an 
      anti-Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin polyclonal antiserum (pAbBCG) was 
      used to improve immunostaining, which was compared to the ZN stain in histological 
      samples. Screening of tissue samples including lungs, pleural lesions, lymph nodes, 
      bone marrow, and skin for mycobacterial infection revealed that pAbBCG staining 
      detects infected macrophages harbouring intracellular mycobacteria or mycobacterial 
      material as well as free mycobacteria that are present at low abundance and not 
      detected by the ZN stain. The positive pAbBCG staining results were confirmed either 
      by PCR analysis of microdissected stained tissue or by culture from tissue. This 
      immunostaining approach allows precise localization of the pathogen in infected 
      tissue.

TI  - Detection of Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and cytomegalovirus 
      in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with hemophilia by 
      polymerase chain reaction of induced sputum samples.
PG  - 976-81
AB  - The purpose of this study was to diagnose the initial stage of acute pulmonary 
      infections due to Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. 
      tuberculosis), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined 
      with the induced sputum method in hemophilia patients infected with human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Induced sputum and PCR were obtained at each 
      outpatient visit or when any respiratory symptoms were present during a one-year 
      period. All patients with a CD4+ count of less than 200 x 10(6)/l were given 
      prophylactics against P. carinii pneumonia (PCP). PCR was conducted 111 times in 29 
      patients. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected in 1 patient and CMV DNA in 4 patients. 
      P. carinii DNA was not detected. PCR on induced sputum samples is sensitive for the 
      rapid detection of the initial stage of respiratory events. PCP prophylaxis changes 
      the clinical manifestations of HIV infection.

TI  - CONSERVATION CHALLENGES: THE LIMITATIONS OF ANTEMORTEM TUBERCULOSIS TESTING IN 
      CAPTIVE ASIATIC LIONS (PANTHERA LEO PERSICA).
PG  - 426-432
LID - 10.1638/2019-0084 [doi]
AB  - Genetic diversity of captive wild animals can be enhanced by moving those 
      individuals with valuable genes between collections and through introduction of a 
      new pair from a range country. This requires movement of animals, which is inherent 
      with disease risks, such as the introduction of pathogenic Mycobacterium sp. (MTBC) 
      into a zoological collection. Decisions need to be made based on the outcome of 
      perimovement disease screening using an array of tests, the majority of which are 
      unvalidated in the species. A pair of endangered Asiatic lions (Panthera leo 
      persica) imported from India to the United Kingdom were screened for MTBC using the 
      comparative intradermal tuberculosis (TB) test, the feline interferon-γ blood test, 
      and the experimental bacteriophage assay. Reactions on all three tests prompted 
      screening of the three resident Asiatic lions using the same tests, all of which 
      were negative for MTBC. Based on these test results, the decision had to be made to 
      exclude the genetically valuable pair from the current collection. MTBC could not be 
      identified using further tests, including culture and PCR on a bronchoalveolar 
      lavage, on feces, or on postmortem tissues. This case series highlights the 
      usefulness of a control group when interpreting unvalidated test results for 
      detection of MTBC, the value of training big cats for conscious blood sampling, and 
      the practical implications of placing the comparative intradermal TB test in the 
      eyelids, when dealing with a species that requires a general anesthetic for most 
      hands-on interventions.

TI  - Predominance of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T lymphocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid of children 
      with tuberculous meningitis: reversal after chemotherapy.
PG  - 301-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: We analyzed the gammadelta T cell composition and responses in the 
      peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children affected by tuberculous 
      meningitis (TBM) and in control children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood 
      and CSF samples were stimulated with different phosphoantigens and IL-2, and 
      expansion of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells assessed by FACS analysis. Vgamma9/Vdelta2 
      lines were obtained by culturing CSF or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in 
      vitro with phosphoantigens and IL-2 for 2 months, and tested for proliferation and 
      cytokine production in response to phosphoantigens. Vdelta2(D)Jdelta junctional 
      sequence length was assessed by PCR. RESULTS: The repertoire of gammadelta T cells 
      from the CSF of TBM patients was characterized by the predominance of 
      Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T lymphocytes, which accounted for >80% of gammadelta T cells. 
      Vgamma9/Vdelta2 cells from the CSF of TBM children responded to different synthetic 
      and natural (mycobacterial) phosphoantigens and produced discrete amounts of 
      IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The in vitro expansion of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells from CSF 
      and peripheral blood of TBM patients prominently decreased following chemotherapy, 
      and similarly, the proportion of ex vivo unstimulated Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells in CSF 
      of TBM patients decreased to levels detected in the CSF of control subjects. Vdelta2 
      CDR3 TCR analysis showed that the remaining Vdelta2 cells in the CSF of TBM patients 
      were still polyclonal. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with an 
      involvement of Vgamma9/Vdelta2 T cells in TBM. http://link.

TI  - Dispensability of surfactant proteins A and D in immune control of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis infection following aerosol challenge of mice.
PG  - 1077-85
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00286-10 [doi]
AB  - Surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and -D) play a role in many acute bacterial, 
      viral, and fungal infections and in acute allergic responses. In vitro, human SPs 
      bind Mycobacterium tuberculosis and alter human and rat macrophage-mediated 
      functions. Here we report the roles of SP-A and SP-D in M. tuberculosis infection 
      following aerosol challenge of SP-A-, SP-D-, and SP-A/-D-deficient mice. These 
      studies surprisingly identified no gross defects in uptake or immune control of M. 
      tuberculosis in SP-A-, SP-D-, and SP-A/-D-deficient mice. While both SP-A- and 
      SP-D-deficient mice exhibited evidence of immunopathologic defects, the CD11b(high) 
      CD11c(high) dendritic cell populations and the gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-dependent 
      CD4(+) T cell response to M. tuberculosis were unaltered in all genotypes tested. 
      Together, these data indicate that SP-A and SP-D are dispensable for immune control 
      of M. tuberculosis in a low-dose, aerosol challenge, murine model of tuberculosis 
      (TB).

TI  - Rapid and efficient detection of extra-pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis by PCR 
      analysis.
PG  - 361-70
AB  - SETTING: The diagnosis of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) remains an important 
      clinical problem, primarily because of the inadequate sensitivity of conventional 
      bacteriologic methods for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in extra-pulmonary 
      specimens. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a IS6110-based polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) method can be utilized to detect M. tuberculosis in non-pulmonary specimens. 
      DESIGN: Specimens from 286 Mexican patients with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of 
      EPTB were prospectively examined by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, mycobacterial culture on 
      Löwenstein-Jensen slants, and by PCR. The DNA for PCR was extracted by the buffer 
      lysis method and phenol-guanidine thiocyanate-chloroform. Primers that amplify a 200 
      bp fragment from the insertion-like M. tuberculosis sequence element IS6110 were 
      utilized. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that this PCR method is highly specific 
      (100%) for identifying M. tuberculosis from a variety of specimens including 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, 
      and lymph node exudate. Moreover, the sensitivity of PCR for detecting M. 
      tuberculosis in CSF (94%), pleural fluid (94%), ascitic fluid and other 
      extrapulmonary specimens (93%) greatly exceeds the sensitivity of conventional smear 
      and culture methods. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that PCR can be a highly 
      specific and sensitive aid in the detection of M. tuberculosis from extra-pulmonary 
      specimens.

      TCR expertise, we previously developed a useful method to isolate clonotypic TCR 
      sequences from Ag-specific IFN-γ-producing T cells and to specifically measure 
      clonotypic TCR frequencies in the T cell pool. In this study, we investigated TCR Vβ 
      repertoires/CDR3 usage, clonal expansion or dominance, and pulmonary trafficking or 
      accumulation for purified protein deritative (PPD)-specific T effector cells 
      producing IFN-γ during bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination and subsequent M. 
      tuberculosis challenge of macaques. We found that while PPD-specific CD4(+) and 
      CD8(+) T effector clones employed diverse TCR Vβ repertoires, 30-33% of 
      IFN-γ(+)CD4(+) T cell clones from three M. tuberculosis-infected macaques expressed 
      TCR bearing a conserved residue leucine in CDR3. Many Ag-specific IFN-γ(+) CD4(+) 
      and few CD8(+) T effector cells emerged as dominant clones during mycobacterial 
      infections and underwent major recall expansion after pulmonary M. tuberculosis 
      infection of BCG-vaccinated macaques. PPD-specific T cell clones readily trafficked 
      to the airway or lung after BCG vaccination or M. tuberculosis infection, and some 
      of them continuously accumulated in lungs during M. tuberculosis infection even 
      after they became undetectable in the circulation. Importantly, remarkable recall 
      expansion and pulmonary accumulation of T effector cells coincided with BCG-induced 
      protection against tuberculosis. Thus, rapid clonal expansion and pulmonary 
      accumulation of Ag-specific T effector cells appear to be one of the immune 
      mechanisms underlying immunity against tuberculosis.

TI  - Kinetics of the immune response profile in guinea pigs after vaccination with 
      Mycobacterium bovis BCG and infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PG  - 4837-46
LID - 10.1128/IAI.00704-09 [doi]
AB  - The guinea pig model of tuberculosis is used extensively in assessing novel 
      vaccines, since Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination effectively prolongs survival 
      after low-dose aerosol infection with virulent M. tuberculosis. To better understand 
      how BCG extends time to death after pulmonary infection with M. tuberculosis, we 
      examined cytokine responses postvaccination and recruitment of activated T cells and 
      cytokine response postinfection. At 10 weeks postvaccination, splenic gamma 
      interferon (IFN-gamma) mRNA was significantly elevated compared to the levels at 5 
      weeks in ex vivo stimulation assays. At 15, 40, 60, and 120 days postinfection, 
      T-cell activation (CD4+ CD62Llow and CD8+ CD62Llow) and mRNA expression of 
      IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-10, 
      IL-12, and eomesodermin were assessed. Our data show that at day 40, BCG-vaccinated 
      guinea pigs had significantly increased levels of IFN-gamma mRNA expression but 
      decreased TNF-alpha mRNA expression in their lungs compared to the levels in 
      nonvaccinated animals. At day 120, a time when nonvaccinated guinea pigs succumbed 
      to infection, low levels of IFN-gamma mRNA were observed even though there were 
      increasing levels of IL-1, IL-12, and IL-10, and the numbers of activated T cells 
      did not differ from those in BCG-vaccinated animals. BCG vaccination conferred the 
      advantage of recruiting greater numbers of CD4+ CD62Llow T cells at day 40, although 
      the numbers of CD8+ CD62Llow T cells were not elevated compared to the numbers in 
      nonvaccinated animals. Our data suggest that day 40 postinfection may be a pivotal 
      time point in determining vaccine efficacy and prolonged survival and that BCG 
      promotes the capacity of T cells in the lungs to respond to infection.

TI  - [Chronic renal failure: unexpected late sequela of pulmonary tuberculosis after 30 
      years].
PG  - 366-70
AB  - Tuberculosis-related chronic granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis (GTN) and 
      chronic renal dysfunction as a consequence of GTN is a rarely seen clinical 
      condition, with a few case reports in the literature. In this report, a case with 
      end stage renal failure as an unexpected late extrapulmonary sequela of tuberculosis 
      has been presented. A 60 years old female patient was admitted to hospital with the 
      complaints of fever, malaise and nausea. Her history revealed that she had pulmonary 
      tuberculosis 30 years ago and received antituberculosis therapy for nine months. The 
      laboratory results on admission were as follows: blood urea nitrogen 90 mg/dl, serum 
      creatinine 9 mg/dl, sodium 116 mEq/L, potassium 6.6 mEq/L, albumine 2.9 g/dl, 
      hemoglobin, 8.4 g/dl, white blood cell count 10.800/mm3, C-reactive protein 187 mg/L 
      and erythrocyte sedimentation rate 110 mm/hour. Urinalysis showed 8.1 g/L protein, 
      10-12 leukocytes, 1-2 erythrocytes, while 24-hours urinalysis yielded proteinuria 
      with 8 ml/minutes creatinine clearance value. Urine and blood cultures of the 
      patient revealed neither bacteria or mycobacteria. PPD skin test was negative. 
      Acid-resistant bacilli (ARB) were not detected in sequential urine samples obtained 
      on three consecutive days. Since sputum samples could not be obtained, diagnostic 
      procedures for sputum were not performed. Abdomen ultrasonography yielded bilateral 
      edema and grade II echogenity in kidneys. Computed tomography of the chest showed 
      bilateral pulmonary nodules, chronic sequela lesions, pleural scarring and 
      calcifications, as well as minimal interstitial infiltrate. Transthoracic lung 
      biopsy showed chronic inflammation and fibrosis, while amyloid was negative. Renal 
      biopsy showed GTN with central caseified necrosis and granulomas, multinuclear giant 
      cells, tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. Amyloid was negative and ARB were 
      not detected in renal biopsy sample. Definitive diagnosis was achieved by the 
      demonstration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis nucleic acid in kidney biopsy by 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Antituberculosis therapy was not initiated since 
      there were no signs of active tuberculosis. The patient became clinically stable 
      following dialysis and was discharged, however, she has been undergoing hemodialysis 
      three times a week. The aim of this case presentation was to emphasize that renal 
      tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with end 
      stage renal failure, especially in countries like Turkey where tuberculosis 
      incidence is high.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a pandemic affecting billions of people worldwide, thus 
      stressing the need for new vaccines. Defining the correlates of vaccine protection 
      is essential to achieve this goal. In this study, we used the wild boar model for 
      mycobacterial infection and TB to characterize the protective mechanisms elicited by 
      a new heat inactivated Mycobacterium bovis vaccine (IV). Oral vaccination with the 
      IV resulted in significantly lower culture and lesion scores, particularly in the 
      thorax, suggesting that the IV might provide a novel vaccine for TB control with 
      special impact on the prevention of pulmonary disease, which is one of the 
      limitations of current vaccines. Oral vaccination with the IV induced an adaptive 
      antibody response and activation of the innate immune response including the 
      complement component C3 and inflammasome. Mycobacterial DNA/RNA was not involved in 
      inflammasome activation but increased C3 production by a still unknown mechanism. 
      The results also suggested a protective mechanism mediated by the activation of 
      IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells by MHC I antigen presenting dendritic cells (DCs) in 
      response to vaccination with the IV, without a clear role for Th1 CD4+ T cells. 
      These results support a role for DCs in triggering the immune response to the IV 
      through a mechanism similar to the phagocyte response to PAMPs with a central role 
      for C3 in protection against mycobacterial infection. Higher C3 levels may allow 
      increased opsonophagocytosis and effective bacterial clearance, while interfering 
      with CR3-mediated opsonic and nonopsonic phagocytosis of mycobacteria, a process 
      that could be enhanced by specific antibodies against mycobacterial proteins induced 
      by vaccination with the IV. These results suggest that the IV acts through novel 
      mechanisms to protect against TB in wild boar.

      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC-PCR) was standardized and compared with standard M. 
      tuberculosis diagnostic techniques or a lymph node PCR (LN-PCR) for the diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis lymphadenitis. Thirty-seven (77%) specimens from 48 patients with 
      clinical or diagnosis of tuberculosis lymphadenitis were positive by cytology [17/48 
      (35%) with no acid fast bacilli (AFB) (suggestive), and 20/48 (42%) with AFB 
      (positive) in direct smears], 30 (63%) by PBMC-PCR, 16 (33%) by LN-PCR, and 13 (27%) 
      by culture. All controls were negative, with the exception of one false-positive 
      LN-PCR. These data suggest the PBMC-PCR may be helpful in the diagnosis of 
      tuberculous lymphadenitis.

TI  - Analysis of BAL fluid in M. avium-intracellulare infection in individuals without 
      predisposing lung disease.
PG  - 1227-31
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of pulmonary 
      inflammation caused by Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) in individuals with 
      neither predisposing lung disease nor immunodeficiency. We reviewed the records of 
      20 patients with pulmonary MAI infection (including 19 female patients) whose past 
      history and previous chest radiographs revealed no predisposing lung disease. We 
      analysed the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from these 20 patients and from six 
      normal female controls. The BALF was recovered directly from the relevant segment 
      that was identified with chest-computed tomography. The BALF cell profiles showed 
      significantly elevated counts for total cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils, but the 
      macrophage cell count was not elevated. The CD4+ lymphocyte count and CD4+/CD8+ 
      ratio were significantly increased compared with those in the controls. The 
      lymphocytes demonstrated phenotypical evidence of activation, with increased 
      expression of human leukocyte antigen-D-related antigen (HLA-DR). The tumour 
      necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations were 
      significantly increased. The neutrophil elastase concentration was also increased, 
      and it was significantly correlated with the neutrophil cell count in the BALF. 
      These findings suggest that the increased counts of activated CD4+ lymphocytes and 
      neutrophils and the elevated concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and 
      neutrophil elastase appear to be common characteristics in Mycobacterium 
      avium-intracellulare infection.

LID - 10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2011.10.010 [doi]
AB  - Immuno-polymerase chain reaction (I-PCR) combines the versatility of enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the exponential amplification power of PCR. The 
      present study was designed to detect antibodies to Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      complex-specific region of difference (RD) antigens, i.e., early secretory antigenic 
      target-6, culture filtrate protein-10, culture filtrate protein-21, and 
      mycobacterial protein from species tuberculosis-64, as well as antigens in pulmonary 
      tuberculosis patients by I-PCR assay. We could detect ESAT-6 and other RD antigens 
      up to 0.1 fg by I-PCR assay, thus resulting in 10(7) times higher sensitivity than 
      that observed with ELISA. With paired sample analysis based on the detection of 
      antibodies in serum and antigens in sputum of the same individual, the sensitivity 
      of RD multi-antigen cocktail-based I-PCR assay was 72% in smear-negative cases and 
      91% in smear-positive cases of pulmonary tuberculosis with high specificity values. 
      In extrapulmonary tuberculosis patients, higher sensitivity was observed by 
      detecting cocktail of antigens by I-PCR assay as compared to sensitivity earlier 
      observed in the same samples by ELISA.

TI  - Comparison of methods based on different molecular epidemiological markers for 
      typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strains: interlaboratory study of 
      discriminatory power and reproducibility.
PG  - 2607-18
AB  - In this study, the currently known typing methods for Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      isolates were evaluated with regard to reproducibility, discrimination, and 
      specificity. Therefore, 90 M. tuberculosis complex strains, originating from 38 
      countries, were tested in five restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) 
      typing methods and in seven PCR-based assays. In all methods, one or more repetitive 
      DNA elements were targeted. The strain typing and the DNA fingerprint analysis were 
      performed in the laboratory most experienced in the respective method. To examine 
      intralaboratory reproducibility, blinded duplicate samples were included. The 
      specificities of the various methods were tested by inclusion of 10 non-M. 
      tuberculosis complex strains. All five RFLP typing methods were highly reproducible. 
      The reliability of the PCR-based methods was highest for the mixed-linker PCR, 
      followed by variable numbers of tandem repeat (VNTR) typing and spoligotyping. In 
      contrast, the double repetitive element PCR (DRE-PCR), IS6110 inverse PCR, IS6110 
      ampliprinting, and arbitrarily primed PCR (APPCR) typing were found to be poorly 
      reproducible. The 90 strains were best discriminated by IS6110 RFLP typing, yielding 
      84 different banding patterns, followed by mixed-linker PCR (81 patterns), APPCR (71 
      patterns), RFLP using the polymorphic GC-rich sequence as a probe (70 patterns), 
      DRE-PCR (63 patterns), spoligotyping (61 patterns), and VNTR typing (56 patterns). 
      We conclude that for epidemiological investigations, strain differentiation by 
      IS6110 RFLP or mixed-linker PCR are the methods of choice. A strong association was 
      found between the results of different genetic markers, indicating a clonal 
      population structure of M. tuberculosis strains. Several separate genotype families 
      within the M. tuberculosis complex could be recognized on the basis of the genetic 
      markers used.

TI  - Use of a multiplex PCR to detect and identify Mycobacterium avium and M. 
      intracellulare in blood culture fluids of AIDS patients.
PG  - 668-74
AB  - The presence of mycobacteria in blood culture fluids (BACTEC) of AIDS patients with 
      positive growth indices (GIs, > 20 U) was investigated by using a multiplex PCR to 
      detect and identify members of the genus Mycobacterium, M. avium, M. intracellulare, 
      and M. tuberculosis. Three different methods of extracting mycobacterial DNA from 
      blood culture fluid were compared for use with the multiplex PCR. Mycobacterial 
      cells were pelleted from a small aliquot of blood culture fluid by centrifugation, 
      and the DNA was extracted from cells by heat lysis or a sodium iodide-isopropanol or 
      a phenol-chloroform method. DNAs of different sizes were amplified from a region of 
      the MPB70 gene of M. tuberculosis (372 bp) and from a region of the 16S rRNA gene of 
      members of the genus Mycobacterium (1,030 bp), M. intracellulare (850 bp), or M. 
      avium (180 bp) as a multiplex PCR in a single tube. The amplified DNA products were 
      detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining in all 41 
      (100%) positive cultures after sodium iodide-isopropanol extraction, in 18 (44%) 
      after heat lysis, and in 5 (12%) after phenol-chloroform extraction. Of the 41 
      positive cultures, 38 were identified as M. avium and 2 were identified as M. 
      intracellulare by both routine methods and multiplex PCR. The remaining 
      mycobacterium was identified as M. intracellulare by routine methods and as M. avium 
      by the multiplex PCR. Another six blood cultures that were negative for the presence 
      of acid-fast bacilli after Ziehl-Neelson staining were also negative by PCR. The 
      study shows that the multiplex PCR is a useful method for the detection and 
      identification of either M. avium or M. intracellulare in small samples of cultured 
      BACTEC 13A fluid with positive GIs ranging from 21 to 999 U. The average time to 
      positive GI was 18 days (median, 13 days) and ranged between 8 and 42 days. The 
      multiplex PCR may permit cultured mycobacteria to be identified at an earlier stage 
      than the routine methods which have been adapted for use with the BACTEC system. The 
      results also show that the method selected for extracting mycobacterial DNA from 
      blood culture fluids is crucial for providing sensitive and accurate PCR results.

TI  - Upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cytokine secretion in peripheral 
      blood monocytes from pulmonary tuberculosis patients.
PG  - 283-91
AB  - SETTING: Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) are the main source of alveolar 
      macrophages, which have an upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in 
      pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta are thought to be involved in 
      the immune response to mycobacterial infection. OBJECTIVE: To identify whether iNOS 
      expression and cytokine release of PBM are upregulated and have a connection in TB 
      infection. DESIGN: The expression of iNOS immunoreactivity on PBM from TB patients 
      and normal subjects was measured by loading with anti-macrophage iNOS polyclonal 
      primary antibody analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression of iNOS mRNA in PBM was 
      detected by RT-PCR. The spontaneous generation of nitrite and cytokines (IL-1 beta 
      and TNF-alpha) by cultured monocytes was also determined. RESULTS: Compared to 
      normal subjects, iNOS immuno-reactivity, the capacity for spontaneous nitrite 
      generation and the level of TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta secretion of PBM were 
      significantly higher in TB patients. The amount of nitrite, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta 
      released from PBM of TB patients was inhibited by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), 
      a competitive inhibitor of NOS. The level of iNOS immunoreactivity on PBM was highly 
      correlated with nitrite generation both in all the subjects studied and in TB 
      patients alone. Spontaneous TNF-alpha production showed a stronger correlation with 
      nitrite production than with IL-1 beta. CONCLUSION: The NO and cytokine synthase 
      activities of monocytes appear to be concomitantly upregulated in response to 
      mycobacterial infection. The enhanced NO generation by monocytes in TB patients may 
      play an autoregulatory role in amplifying the synthesis of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines.

PG  - 19-23
AB  - The U.S.-Japan Medical Cooperative Program has been started in 1965 and Tuberculosis 
      Panel is one of the most important field of the programs. In this lecture, the 
      recent advances in the basic studies on tuberculosis researches which were reported 
      in Tuberculosis panel of the program were summarized. The host defence mechanisms 
      against M. tuberculosis infection were the most important subject. The role of 
      Th1-mediated cytokins such as IL-2, IFN gamma and TNF beta in the host-defence 
      mechanism against mycobacterial infection was extensively discussed. Bcg gene of the 
      mice is the example case for the genetic background of host against mycobacterial 
      infection. The virulence factor, however of M. tuberculosis is still unknown. The 
      technique of molecular biology was applied to the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The PCR 
      and RFLP methods are the useful strategies for the rapid diagnosis and analysis of 
      the mode of infection with M. tuberculosis. The development of detection techniques 
      of drug-resistant tubercle bacilli is also urgently required. Another approach by 
      molecular biology to tuberculosis research is the cloning of gene of tuberculin 
      protein and the production recombinant protein of M. tuberculosis. The amino acid 
      sequences of several proteins have been determined and their immunological 
      properties of recombinant proteins were investigated. The immunological functions of 
      lipid fractions of tubercle bacilli such as cord factor (TDM) and lipoarabinomannan 
      (LAM) have been described. Especially the immunomodulating activities and the role 
      of TDM as diagnostic antigen in the tuberculosis patients were described. The 
      adjuvant activity of mycobacterial cell wall was well established and the minimum 
      structural requirement was reported to be N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine 
      (MDP). The several MDP derivatives were selected as the cytokine inducers. 
      Especially MDP-Lys (L18) was widely used as drug for the increasing the number of 
      white blood cells and platelets in cancer patients. The effectiveness of MDP 
      derivatives on the stimulating of mucosal immunity was also recently reported. The 
      preventing activities of virus infection and cancer metastasis of MDP derivatives 
      were shown in mice models.

TI  - Correlation between the kinetics of Th1, Th2 cells and pathology in a murine model 
      of experimental pulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - 26-33
AB  - T-helper 1 (Th1) Th2 kinetics were studied by immunohistochemistry and molecular 
      biology techniques (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RT PCR, 
      Southern-blot) during the course of pulmonary tuberculosis induced in BALB/c mice by 
      the intratracheal instillation of the live and virulent strain H-37Rv. The 
      histopathological study clearly showed two phases of the disease. The first one was 
      an acute phase which was characterized by inflammatory infiltrate in the alveolar 
      capillary interstitium, blood vessel and bronchial wall with formation of 
      granulomas. In this acute phase which lasted from 1 to 28 days, a clear predominance 
      of Th1 cells was observed, manifested by a high percentage of interleukin-2 (IL-2) 
      positive cells in the inflammatory infiltrate and granulomas demonstrated by 
      immunohistology, as well as a gradual increment of interferon-gamma (INF-gamma) 
      m-RNA. This was followed by a chronic or advanced phase characterized by pneumonia, 
      focal necrosis and fibrosis, with a Th0 balance due to an equivalent proportion of 
      IL-2 and IL-4 positive cells in the lung lesions, that coincided with the highest 
      level of INF-gamma and IL-4 mRNA. The cytofluorometric analysis of bronchial lavage 
      cells, showed a predominance of CD4 T cells during the acute phase and CD8 T 
      lymphocytes in the chronic phase, gamma-delta T lymphocytes showed two peaks, at the 
      beginning (3 days) and at the end (4 months) of the infection. These results suggest 
      that T-lymphocyte subset kinetics and the pattern of cytokines produced in the lung 
      during tuberculosis infection changed over time and correlate with the type and 
      magnitude of tissue injury.

TI  - Influence of ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphisms on plasma nevirapine and efavirenz levels 
      and their effects on virologic and immunological outcomes in HIV/TB co-infected Thai 
      adults under anti-retroviral therapy.
PG  - 78-88
AB  - ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (encoded by ABCB-1 or MDR-1) has an important 
      role in cellular export of antiretroviral agents. A previous study showed that 
      ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphism affects plasma efavirenz and nelfinavir concentrations 
      and rate of CD4+ T cell recovery after starting antiretroviral treatment (ART). The 
      present study examined the influence of ABCB-1 polymorphisms on plasma nevirapine 
      and efavirenz levels when co-administered with rifampicin in 124 HIV/TB patients who 
      received nevirapine- (400 mg/day) (n = 59) and efavirenz- (600 mg/day) (n = 65) 
      based ART. ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphisms were genotyped using real-time PCR. CD4 T 
      cell counts and HIV-1 viral RNA were evaluated in response to ART. The frequencies 
      of CC, CT and TT genotypes of ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphism were 34% (n = 42), 55% (n = 
      68) and 12% (n = 14), respectively. Contrary to the previous report, no association 
      was found among these genotypes and plasma drug concentrations at weeks 6 and 12 of 
      ART and after rifampicin discontinuation. We also observed no differences in CD4+ T 
      cell recovery rate among different ABCB-1 C3435T genotypes. In nevirapine group, 
      however, all the patients with CT genotype achieved HIV-1 RNA levels of < 50 
      copies/ml, while 67% of those with TT and 95% with CC genotypes achieved < 50 
      copies/ml (p = 0.040). These data suggested that ABCB-1 C3435T polymorphisms do not 
      affect plasma nevirapine and efavirenz concentrations in HIV/TB co-infected Thai 
      patients or their immunological outcome, but had an effect on virologic outcome in 
      the nevirapine-treated group.

TI  - Evaluation of polymerase chain reaction, adenosine deaminase, and interferon-gamma 
      in pleural fluid for the differential diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis.
PG  - 1355-64
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Pleural tuberculosis (TB) is a diagnostic challenge because of its 
      nonspecific clinical presentation and paucibacillary nature. The inefficiency of 
      conventional laboratory methods and the reliance on pleural biopsy have motivated 
      the evaluation of alternative diagnostic strategies. We have evaluated polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) directed to the IS6110 sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
      the determination of adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity, and measurement of 
      interferon (IFN)-gamma levels in pleural fluid in the diagnosis of pleural TB. 
      PATIENTS: ADA activity, IFN-gamma levels, and PCR were evaluated in 140 cases of 
      pleural effusion, 42 with confirmed pleural TB, 19 with probable pleural TB, 70 with 
      a nontuberculous etiology, and 9 having an undetermined etiology. RESULTS: ADA 
      activity, IFN-gamma levels, and PCR were 88%, 85.7%, and 73.8% sensitive, 
      respectively, and 85.7%, 97.1%, and 90% specific, respectively, for pleural TB that 
      had been confirmed by either culture or pleural biopsy specimens. The combination of 
      PCR, IFN-gamma measurement, and ADA activity determination allowed the selective 
      increase of sensitivity and specificity for probable and confirmed cases compared to 
      individual methods. Positive and negative predictive values for these individual or 
      combined methods were maintained over a wide range of prevalence of pleural TB in 
      the patient population presenting with pleural effusions. Fever and younger age were 
      associated with tuberculous pleural effusion (p < 0. 0001), while blood in sputum 
      and older age were associated with malignant etiology (p < 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These clinical variables together with the use of ADA activity determination, PCR, 
      and measurement of IFN-gamma levels provide the basis for the rapid and efficient 
      diagnosis of pleural TB in different clinical settings.

TI  - The effect of tuberculin testing on the development of cell-mediated immune 
      responses during Mycobacterium bovis infection.
PG  - 25-36
AB  - Protection against tuberculosis (TB) is associated with Th1-type cell-mediated 
      immunity (CMI). Whilst the intradermal injection of partially purified derivatives 
      of tuberculin (PPD) represents the classic test assessing the delayed type 
      hypersensitivity (DTH) response used in both humans and cattle for diagnosing TB, it 
      has been suggested that the test may modulate host CMI responses. To investigate the 
      kinetics of the development of the DTH response and its subsequent effect on CMI 
      responses, groups of 6-month old calves were inoculated intranasally with 8 x 10(4) 
      cfu of Mycobacterium bovis, subjected to the comparative intradermal tuberculin test 
      (TT) using bovine and avian PPD (PPD-B, PPD-A) at various time intervals 
      post-infection, and immune responses compared. These included DTH, lymphocyte 
      proliferation, IgG production, and synthesis of the cytokines: IFNgamma, IL-10, 
      IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13. All animals were subjected to post-mortem examination. The 
      kinetics of the development of the DTH response assessed in the TT was such that 
      infected cattle could be identified as early as 3 weeks post-infection, which 
      correlated with the detection of an antigen-specific IFNgamma response. Transient 
      increases in plasma-derived IFNgamma as a result of TT during an established TB 
      infection were more pronounced when blood was stimulated with PPD-A compared with 
      PPD-B stimulation. This has the potential to mask diagnosis of infection as a result 
      of the stronger avian-bias if the IFNgamma test is used the week following TT. 
      Disease pathology was not affected by TT. A transient failure to a second TT was 
      observed in 1 of 30 animals and the time (post-infection) at which the TT is 
      administered may be of significance. In serum, IgG responses to PPD-B, which were 
      undetectable prior to TT, were elevated after TT and were most pronounced in cattle 
      that were TT at 6 weeks post-infection. Other cytokines were also affected by the 
      TT; IL-4 mRNA levels increased and IL-6 mRNA levels decreased, whilst PPD-B specific 
      IL-10 protein synthesis was enhanced. These observations may offer the potential for 
      further diagnostic assays that could complement the TT and IFNgamma test.

TI  - Depressed interleukin-12 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells after in 
      vitro stimulation with the 30-kDa antigen in recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis 
      patients.
PG  - 61-9
AB  - Some patients develop recurrent tuberculosis (R-TB), even after successfully 
      completing initial anti-tubercular treatment. Although R-TB may be caused by relapse 
      or exogenous reinfection, little is known about the underlying host responses 
      associated with R-TB. This study investigated the profile of cytokines [interferon 
      (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-6, and 
      IL-10] present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 17 R-TB patients 
      after stimulation with the 30-kDa antigen (Ag) or purified protein derivative (PPD) 
      Ag of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These data were compared with data obtained from 
      15 patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB (N-TB), 22 patients with treatment 
      failure (TF-TB), and 19 healthy tuberculin reactors (HTR). N-TB and R-TB patients 
      were enrolled in this study within 1 month of beginning anti-tubercular 
      chemotherapy. ELISA results showed that IFN-gamma production following stimulation 
      with the 30-kDa Ag was significantly lower in each group of TB patients than in the 
      HTR controls. In addition, patients with R-TB showed the most significant IL-12 
      depression among the subject groups after in vitro stimulation with either Ag. 
      Furthermore, a significant decrease in TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels was observed in 
      R-TB patients relative to N-TB patients. However, there was no statistical 
      difference in TNF-alpha and IL-10 production between R-TB patients, TF-TB patients, 
      and HTR controls. Our findings suggest that the underlying mechanisms of cytokine 
      regulation might differ between N-TB and R-TB patients, and that decreased IL-12 
      production in response to the 30-kDa or PPD Ag might be involved in the 
      immunopathogenesis of human R-TB.

AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct culture were applied for detection of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in samples obtained from patients with suspicion 
      of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. In the reaction of amplification 
      IS6110 was applied as a target region, and PCR reaction products were of the size of 
      123 bp and 317 bp. A total of 278 samples (158 sputum, 36 urine, 25 pleural 
      effusion, 23 bronchial washings, 8 blood, 4 stomach washings, 3 cerebrospinal fluid, 
      2 fragments of skin, 2 pleural effusion, and 17 others samples) from 181 patients 
      were tested. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was detected by PCR in 144 out of 
      278 samples and by culture in 68 of 278 samples. The PCR test enabled a rapid and 
      sensitive diagnosis particularly in a number of samples which were negative on 
      culture.

TI  - Immunosuppression during active tuberculosis is characterized by decreased 
      interferon- gamma production and CD25 expression with elevated forkhead box P3, 
      transforming growth factor- beta , and interleukin-4 mRNA levels.
PG  - 870-8
AB  - The balance between effector and regulatory responses after Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis infection may dictate outcome and progression to active disease. We 
      investigated effector and regulatory T cell responses in bacille Calmette-Guerin 
      (BCG)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and whole blood cultures from 
      persons with active tuberculosis (TB), persons with TB at the end of 6 months of 
      treatment, and healthy control subjects with latent TB infection. All 3 groups 
      displayed BCG-induced increases in effector and regulatory T cell phenotypes as 
      defined by CD4(+)CD25(lo) and CD4(+)CD25(hi) T cells, respectively. In case patients 
      with active disease, BCG stimulation induced the lowest increase of CD25, 
      CD4(+)CD25(hi), CTLA-4, and interferon- gamma . However, these case patients 
      expressed the highest mRNA levels of forkhead box P3, transforming growth factor 
      (TGF)- beta , and interleukin (IL)-4 and a lower T-bet : GATA-3 ratio. There were no 
      significant differences in IL-4 delta 2, IL-10, or TGF- beta receptor-II mRNA 
      expression between groups. Together, these results suggest that immunosuppression 
      seen after mycobacterial stimulation in case patients with active TB is associated 
      with naturally occurring regulatory T cells.

TI  - Expression of the leptin receptor outside of bone marrow-derived cells regulates 
      tuberculosis control and lung macrophage MHC expression.
PG  - 3776-84
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1003226 [doi]
AB  - Leptin is a pleiotropic hormone proposed to link nutritional status to the 
      development of strong Th1 immunity. Because Mycobacterium tuberculosis control is 
      affected by starvation and diabetes, we studied the role of the leptin receptor in 
      regulating distinct immune cells during chronic infection. Infected db/db mice, 
      bearing a natural mutation in the leptin receptor, have a markedly increased 
      bacterial load in their lungs when compared with that of their wild-type 
      counterparts. In response to M. tuberculosis infection, db/db mice exhibited 
      disorganized granulomas, neutrophilia, and reduced B cell migration to the lungs, 
      correlating with dysfunctional lung chemokine responses that include XCL1, CCL2, 
      CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL13. In a db/db lung, myeloid cells were delayed in their 
      production of inducible NO synthase and had reduced expression of MHC I and II. 
      Although the Th1 cell response developed normally in the absence of leptin 
      signaling, production of pulmonary IFN-γ was delayed and ineffective. Surprisingly, 
      a proper immune response took place in bone marrow (BM) chimeras lacking leptin 
      receptor exclusively in BM-derived cells, indicating that leptin acts indirectly on 
      immune cells to modulate the antituberculosis response and bacterial control. 
      Together, these findings suggest that the pulmonary response to M. tuberculosis is 
      affected by the host's nutritional status via the regulation of non-BM-derived 
      cells, not through direct action of leptin on Th1 immunity.

TI  - Amplification of IS6110 sequence for detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex 
      in HIV-negative patients with fever of unknown origin (FUO) and evidence of 
      extrapulmonary disease.
PG  - 415-24
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) constitutes the main cause of classic 
      fever of unknown origin (FUO) in many populations. The aim of this study was to 
      improve the diagnostic field of the disease using a nested polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) assay, specific for the IS6110 insertion element of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      complex, in order to achieve a more timely diagnosis and treatment. SETTING: 
      Twenty-four, HIV-negative classic FUO patients who were admitted to the Regional 
      Hospital of Alexandroupolis between April 1997 and July 1999. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: 
      The above patients were considered as putative extrapulmonary TB after 3 weeks of 
      in-patient investigation and underwent exhaustive examination for diagnosis of the 
      disease. For this purpose, specimens were obtained from peripheral blood and bone 
      marrow from these patients, as well as from damaged tissues, and analysed by both 
      PCR and conventional methods. Anti-tuberculous treatment was initiated in 16 out of 
      24 patients and the response to this regimen was considered as the final criterion 
      for diagnosis of tuberculosis. RESULTS: Extrapulmonary TB was established in 11 
      patients. The PCR-based methodology, when applied to samples derived from bone 
      marrow aspirations and suspected damaged tissues, was able to diagnose 10 of them, 
      whereas the conventional methods were able to detect only two. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results confirm the diagnostic value of molecular detection of M. tuberculosis in 
      cases of FUO, thus supporting the application of PCR in tissue samples suspected of 
      bacillus infection. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that bone marrow aspiration 
      specimens constitute an alternative, easy, safe and reliable source for such PCR 
      analysis.

TI  - Novel use of guanidinium isothiocyanate in the isolation of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis DNA from clinical material.
PG  - 113-7
AB  - Nucleic acid amplification technologies offer great promise for the rapid, sensitive 
      and specific diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, the isolation of inhibitor-free DNA 
      from biological specimens is a bottleneck of the PCR assay. Here we describe a 
      simple method for the isolation of PCR-amplifiable DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      from all types of samples of pulmonary and extrapulmonary origin tested. Briefly, it 
      involves concentration of the bacilli by high-speed centrifugation, removal of PCR 
      inhibitors by a wash solution containing guanidinium isothiocyanate and the release 
      of bacterial DNA by heating in the presence of detergents and Chelex-100 resin. The 
      entire process is accomplished within approximately 3 h. The method has been 
      validated on 780 samples of human, bovine and guinea pig origin including sputum, 
      cerebrospinal fluid, pulmonary fluids, pus, fine needle aspirate, tissue, blood and 
      milk.

TI  - [A case of arteria cerebri aneurysm, sepsis, and miliary lung infiltrates in a 
      32-year-old woman].
PG  - 740-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Miliary tuberculosis is a rare manifestation of tuberculosis with a high 
      mortality rate. Diagnosis may easily be missed when severe neurologic symptoms are 
      the first clinical manifestation. A typical case of miliary tuberculosis is 
      reported, with special regard to the problems of diagnostic work-up. The need for an 
      early empirical therapy for suspected military tuberculosis is emphasized in 
      particular. CASE REPORT: A 32-year-old Moroccan woman was admitted to the hospital 
      with aphasia and a hemiparesis due to an intracerebral hemorrhage caused by a 
      ruptured septic A. cerebri media aneurysm. Despite intensive work-up no septic focus 
      could be found. Chest radiograph and computerized tomography (CT) showed miliary 
      consolidations in the lungs. Skin testing (Tuberkulin Behring GT5) and smears for 
      acid-fast bacilli and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for tuberculosis of 
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were negative. A four-drug antituberculous regimen 
      (rifampicin [RMP], isoniazid [INH], pyrazinamide [PZA], ethambutol [EMB]) was 
      initiated, and resulted in normalization of temperature, blood pressure, and 
      C-reactive protein. Subsequently, cultures of BAL yielded Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis. The patient was discharged, a two-drug regimen was conducted (RMP, 
      INH) after 2 months. Follow-up of the patient showed a significant improvement of 
      the miliary lung consolidations after 5 months in CT of the lung. Only minor 
      neurologic symptoms persisted after cessation of the therapy. CONCLUSION: In 
      developed countries, miliary tuberculosis is a very rare cause of septic 
      infiltrative lung disease. However, due to the nonspecific nature of the 
      presentation and despite improved diagnostic techniques, a high clinical suspicion 
      is essential for successful treatment.

TI  - Use of HLA-DR*08032/E7 and HLA-DR*0818/E7 tetramers in tracking of epitope-specific

AB  - Comparative tracking of tetramer-positive and epitope-specific CD4(+) T cells in 
      blood and other tissues from tuberculosis (TB) patients during TB development and 
      treatment using control donor samples is not well characterized. In this study, a 
      novel HLA-DR-restricted peptide E7 from the ESAT-6 protein of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (MTB) was used to prepare modified HLA-DR*08032/E7 tetramer (tetramer 
      1) and HLA-DR*0818/E7 tetramer (tetramer 2) to monitor a series of samples from TB 
      patients and control donors. Tetramer staining showed that (1) by direct staining of 
      single sample and flow cytometric analyses, detection of tetramer-positive CD4(+) T 
      cells ranged from 0.1% to 8.8% (median 0.67% in tetramer 1 and 0.5% in tetramer 2), 
      0.1 to 10.7% (0.74% and 0.71%), 0.02 to 2.2% (0.25% and 0.25%), 0.02 to 0.48% (0.2% 
      and 0.2%) and most at under 0-0.2% (0.2% and 0.16%) in the initial pulmonary TB 
      (PTB) patients' blood, pleural fluid (PLF) of initial tuberculous pleuritis 
      patients, non-TB patients' blood, healthy donors' blood and umbilical cord blood, 
      respectively; significantly higher levels of CD4(+) T cells were detected in samples 
      of TB patients than in three control donor groups; (2) by direct staining of time 
      point TB samples and flow cytometric analyses, along with TB symptom amendment at 
      day 60, tetramer-positive CD4(+) T cells began to decrease, until after 90-120 days, 
      reached and kept at a relatively low even normal level about at 0.03-0.3%; (3) by 
      enrichment approach, at least 10-fold increased memory tetramer-positive CD4(+) T 
      cells were seen; (4) by in situ staining, tetramer-positive, IFN-γ-producing and/or 
      TNF-α-producing CD4(+) T cells in the lymph node and lung granuloma and cavernous 
      tissues of TB patients could be determined. Therefore, by further increasing the 
      sample size tested to confirm the specificity and sensitivity of tetrameric 
      molecules, it should be possible to develop them for use as research and diagnostic 
      reagents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data are scarce regarding the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) among 
      tuberculosis (TB) patients in Bangladesh. This study was undertaken to estimate the 
      number needed to screen (NNS) to identify a case of DM among those with TB symptoms 
      and those with confirmed TB disease, and to identify factors predicting treatment 
      outcomes of TB patients with and without DM. METHODS: Persons attending 
      public-private model screening centres in urban Dhaka for the evaluation of TB were 
      offered free blood glucose testing in addition to computer-aided chest X-ray and 
      sputum Xpert MTB/RIF. RESULTS: Among 7647 people evaluated for both TB and DM, the 
      NNS was 35 (95% confidence interval (CI) 31-40) to diagnose one new case of DM; 
      among those diagnosed with TB, the NNS was 21 (95% CI 17-29). Among those with 
      diagnosed TB, patients with DM were more likely to have cavitation on chest X-ray 
      compared to those without DM (31% vs 22%). Treatment failure (odds ratio (OR) 18.9, 
      95% CI 5.43-65.9) and death (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.11-3.90) were more common among TB 
      patients with DM than among TB patients without DM. DM was the most important 
      predictor of a poor treatment outcome in the classification analysis for TB patients 
      aged 39 years and above. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable burden of DM was found among 
      patients accessing TB diagnostics through a public-private model in urban 
      Bangladesh, and DM was associated with advanced TB disease and a high rate of poor 
      treatment outcome.

TI  - Correlation of cytokine gene expression with pathology in white-tailed deer 
      (Odocoileus virginianus) infected with Mycobacterium bovis.
PG  - 640-7
AB  - Mycobacterium bovis-infected white-tailed deer (WTD) in northeast Michigan are a 
      reservoir of mycobacteria that pose a threat to both domestic animals and humans. 
      Relatively little work has been done to characterize the immune response of WTD to 
      M. bovis infection; however, an understanding of the immune response to infection 
      and pathogenesis may be critical to the development of an effective vaccine. 
      Immunological responses to infection were characterized by monitoring cytokine gene 
      expression in M. bovis-infected and uninfected deer. Peripheral blood leukocytes 
      (PBL) from infected WTD expressed more gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), 
      interleukin-12p40 (IL-12p40), granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, and 
      IL-4 mRNA than did PBL from uninfected deer; however, differences were not detected 
      in expression of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta mRNA. Infected animals 
      could be divided into two groups based on pathology. Lesions were confined primarily 
      to the lymph nodes of the head in animals with less severe pathology. Animals with 
      more severe pathology had lesions in the lung and associated lymph nodes as well as 
      the lymph nodes of the head. More robust IFN-gamma mRNA expression correlated with 
      pathology early in infection. These findings indicate that IFN-gamma expression 
      likely plays a role in both protection and pathogenesis.

TI  - TLR9 regulates Th1 responses and cooperates with TLR2 in mediating optimal 
      resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PG  - 1715-24
AB  - To investigate the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR)9 in the immune response to 
      mycobacteria as well as its cooperation with TLR2, a receptor known to be triggered 
      by several major mycobacterial ligands, we analyzed the resistance of TLR9(-/-) as 
      well as TLR2/9 double knockout mice to aerosol infection with Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis. Infected TLR9(-/-) but not TLR2(-/-) mice displayed defective 
      mycobacteria-induced interleukin (IL)-12p40 and interferon (IFN)-gamma responses in 
      vivo, but in common with TLR2(-/-) animals, the TLR9(-/-) mice exhibited only minor 
      reductions in acute resistance to low dose pathogen challenge. When compared with 
      either of the single TLR-deficient animals, TLR2/9(-/-) mice displayed markedly 
      enhanced susceptibility to infection in association with combined defects in 
      proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro, IFN-gamma recall responses ex vivo, 
      and altered pulmonary pathology. Cooperation between TLR9 and TLR2 was also evident 
      at the level of the in vitro response to live M. tuberculosis, where dendritic cells 
      and macrophages from TLR2/9(-/-) mice exhibited a greater defect in IL-12 response 
      than the equivalent cell populations from single TLR9-deficient animals. These 
      findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for TLR9 in the host response to M. 
      tuberculosis and illustrate TLR collaboration in host resistance to a major human 
      pathogen.

TI  - Cytokine profiles for peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with active 
      pulmonary tuberculosis and healthy household contacts in response to the 
      30-kilodalton antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PG  - 176-80
AB  - Patients with active tuberculosis (TB) have a stronger humoral but a poorer cellular 
      immune response to the secreted 30-kDa antigen (Ag) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      than do healthy household contacts (HHC), who presumably are more protected against 
      disease. The basis for this observation was studied by examining the Th1 
      (interleukin 2 [IL-2] and gamma interferon [IFN-gamma])- and Th2 (IL-10 and 
      IL-4)-type cytokines produced in response to the 30-kDa Ag by peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with active pulmonary TB (n = 7) and from HHC 
      who were tuberculin (purified protein derivative) skin test positive (n = 12). 
      Thirty-kilodalton-Ag-stimulated PBMC from TB patients produced significantly lower 
      levels of IFN-gamma (none detectable) than did those from HHC (212 +/- 73 pg/ml, 
      mean +/- standard error) (P < 0.001). Likewise, 30-kDa-Ag-stimulated PBMC from TB 
      patients failed to express IFN-gamma mRNA by reverse transcription-PCR, whereas 
      cells from HHC expressed the IFN-gamma gene. In contrast, 30-kDa-Ag-stimulated PBMC 
      from TB patients produced significantly higher levels of IL-10 (403 +/- 80 pg/ml) 
      than did those from HHC (187 +/- 66 pg/ml) (P < 0.013), although cells from both 
      groups expressed the IL-10 gene. IL-2 and IL-4 were not consistently produced, and 
      their genes were not expressed by 30-kDa-Ag-stimulated cells from either TB patients 
      or HHC. After treatment with antituberculous drugs, lymphocytes from four of the 
      seven TB patients proliferated and three of them expressed IFN-gamma mRNA in 
      response to the 30-kDa Ag and produced decreased levels of IL-10.

AB  - In patients with malignant blood disease, infection is the most serious 
      complication. The prompt differential diagnosis of tuberculosis leads to an 
      appropriate treatment. A method based on DNA amplification and hybridization for the 
      rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was used to test 10 clinical specimens 
      (sputum, gastric aspirate and pleural effusion) from blood disease patients in whom 
      tuberculosis was suspected. Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA was detected in 3 
      specimens, including one which was negative on standard microbiological criteria 
      (microscopy and/or culture). The other 7 specimens with fever or abnormal shadow on 
      a chest X-ray were negative by both our method and the Standard microbiological 
      criteria. Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis by amplification of mycobacterial DNA in 
      cases of blood disease in clinically useful.

TI  - Attenuation of HLA-DR expression by mononuclear phagocytes infected with 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis is related to intracellular sequestration of immature 
      class II heterodimers.
PG  - 4882-93
AB  - MHC class II expression was examined in macrophages infected with Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis. IFN-gamma increased the surface expression of class II molecules in 
      THP-1 cells and this was markedly reduced in cells infected with M. tuberculosis. 
      Despite this effect, steady state levels of HLA-DRalpha, HLA-DRbeta, and invariant 
      (Ii) chains were equivalent in control and infected cells. Metabolic labeling 
      combined with pulse-chase experiments and biochemical analysis showed that the 
      majority of class II molecules in infected cells became resistant to endoglycosidase 
      H, consistent with normal Golgi processing. However, results of intracellular 
      staining and dual color confocal microscopy revealed a significant defect in 
      transport of newly synthesized class II molecules through the endocytic compartment. 
      Thus, compared with findings in control cells, class II molecules in infected cells 
      colocalized to a minimal extent with a lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1+ 
      endosomal compartment. In addition, in contrast to control cells, class II molecules 
      in infected cells failed to colocalize with endocytosed BSA under conditions where 
      this marker is known to label late endosomes, lysosomes, and the MHC class II 
      compartment. Consistent with defective transport along the endocytic pathway, the 
      maturation of SDS-stable class II alphabeta dimers--dependent upon removal of Ii 
      chain and peptide loading of class II dimers in the MHC class II compartment--was 
      markedly impaired in M. tuberculosis-infected cells. These findings indicate that 
      defective transport and processing of class II molecules through the 
      endosomal/lysosomal system is responsible for diminished cell surface expression of 
      MHC class II molecules in cells infected with M. tuberculosis.

TI  - Bronchoalveolar neutrophils, interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 and interleukin-7 
      in AIDS-associated tuberculosis.
PG  - 254-9
AB  - During advanced AIDS tuberculosis (TB) often presents atypically with smear-negative 
      and non-cavitary disease, yet immune features associated with this change are poorly 
      characterized. We examined the local immune response in a cohort of Tanzanian 
      AIDS-associated TB patients who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. TB infection was 
      confirmed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid by culture, probe and polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR). Among TB patients CD4 count correlated positively with the 
      extent of cavitary disease as well as BAL TB load (qPCR C(T)). TB patients had 
      significantly higher granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) than 
      non-TB patients, and those with non-cavitary TB had significantly higher BAL 
      interferon gamma-inducible protein (IP-10) and interleukin (IL)-7 than those with 
      cavities. BAL neutrophils were as prevalent as monocytes/macrophages or epithelial 
      cells, and immunohistochemistry revealed that neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, 
      and epithelial cells were major sources of the IP-10 and IL-7. These data suggest a 
      dysregulated cytokine profile may contribute to the TB of advanced AIDS.

TI  - Field evaluation of the protective efficacy of Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine 
      against bovine tuberculosis.
PG  - 44-9
LID - 10.1016/j.rvsc.2009.05.022 [doi]
AB  - The protective efficacy of Mycobacterium bovis BCG (1 x 10(6) single dose) was 
      evaluated under field conditions. A total of 140 male Holstein Friesian calves, one 
      to two week-old were selected. Two groups of 70 each were formed, one group was 
      vaccinated and the other was injected with a placebo during their second week of age 
      and followed until 12 months of age. The study considered a positive case of 
      tuberculosis to be an animal that had a positive reaction to the three following 
      tests in a row: tuberculin, IFNgamma PPD-B and IFNgamma ESAT6-CFP10 during the 12 
      months of exposure. The results showed a 59.4% efficacy (IC95%: 47.64-71.16). The 
      non-vaccinated calves were 2.4 times more at risk of becoming infected (IC95%: 
      1.07-5.68) compared to vaccinated animals. As a complementary test a PCR test was 
      performed using nasal exudates in some animals from both groups using a 
      Mycobacterium complex detection kit. All the positive PCR reactions (5/44) were 
      found in the non-vaccinated animals. These findings suggest that the use of the BCG 
      vaccine, even though it is not capable of protecting 100%, does prevent TB 
      vaccinated animals from excreting bacilli in their nasal secretions at their first 
      year of age.

TI  - [Use of PCR for TB bacteria on BAL in early diagnosis of tubercular lobitis].
PG  - 173-7
AB  - In June 2008 a 23-year-old immunocompetent came to our observation, without fever 
      and with an occasional cough for 2 months, who showed two chest X-rays and a CT, 
      performed respectively 60, 40 and 20 days earlier, that pointed to a small lobitis 
      at the right lung base. The patient had already undergone several antibiotic 
      therapies that had not changed the X-graphic framework. On presentation, routine 
      blood tests and cultural examinations of sputum were carried out to detect common 
      germs, fungi and TB bacteria (microscopic observation, cultivation and PCR), and a 
      new antibiotic therapy (piperacillin/tazobactam) was started. Since the radiological 
      picture appeared unchanged after 10 days of therapy and the examinations 
      (microscopic observation and PCR) were negative, bronchoscopy with bacteriological 
      evaluation of BAL was performed, which was positive to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
      and then tubercular lobitis was diagnosed. Therefore a specific therapy - rifampin 
      (RMP), isoniazid (INH), etambutol (EMB), pyrazinamid (PZA) - was started and changed 
      after 10 days due to the growth of mycobacteria resistant to INH and EMB on 
      examination of sputum. Consequently, the early use of PCR on BAL allows, in skilled 
      hands, small aspecific lobitis to be diagnosed more rapidly than using cultural 
      examination of sputum.

TI  - Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA from peripheral blood in patients with 
      HIV-seronegative and new cases of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis by 
      polymerase chain reaction.
PG  - 676-81
AB  - Tuberculosis is still one of the most important cause of mortality and morbidity in 
      many countries and there is a need for new methods for accurate and rapid diagnosis 
      of tuberculosis. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) method, we have evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in 
      peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in adult patients with human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative and new cases of smear-positive pulmonary 
      tuberculosis. We investigated the relationship between characteristic of the 
      patients, radiological extension of the disease, sputum smear grade, presence of 
      cavity, body-mass index (BMI) serum albumin level, total delay time and PCR 
      positivity. Forty patients (33 male and 7 female; mean age 37.8 +/- 14.1) and 20 
      healthy control subjects (13 male and 7 female; mean age 35.6 +/- 7.3) were enrolled 
      in this study. PCR was positive in 16 of 40 (40%) patients with pulmonary 
      tuberculosis and negative in 24 of 40 (60%). None of the healthy controls had 
      positive PCR results. The overall sensitivity specificity and accuracy of the PCR 
      assay was 40, 100 and 60%, respectively. We found the positive correlation between 
      PCR positivity and sputum smear grade (r=0.46, P=0.003) radiological extension of 
      the disease (r=0.69, P=0.001), presence of cavity (r=0.90, P=0.001). We conclude 
      that the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA from peripheral blood by PCR technique is 
      useful for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis patients with HIV-negative. 
      Hematogenous dissemination was important in tuberculosis patients and peripheral 
      blood samples were suitable and easy materials. However, standardization of the PCR 
      method must be ensured for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

TI  - [Bone and joint tuberculosis concurrent with tuberculosis of other organs].
PG  - 523-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the characteristics of bone or joint tuberculosis (TB) 
      accompanied by TB in other organs (especially the lung), and to study patients' and 
      doctors' delay in detecting bone or joint TB. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A retrospective 
      study was conducted on 33 patients with bone or joint TB concurrent with TB of other 
      organs, especially the lung, who were admitted to our hospital between 1981 and 
      2005. The patients were divided into the following three groups according to the 
      organ of concurrent TB : (1) miliary TB group (N = 10), (2) pulmonary TB group (N = 
      19), and (3) other TB site group (N = 4). The relationship between bone/joint TB and 
      TB of other organs was studied by comparing the three groups with respect to the 
      time of appearance of musculo-skeletal symptoms or signs such as swelling and pain 
      and that of symptoms or signs originating from other organs, such as cough, sputum, 
      miliary pattern on chest radiograph and superficial lymph node swelling. RESULTS: 
      The mean age (SD) of patients was 50.5 (18.9) yr, and the male to female ratio was 
      23 : 10. Among 33 patients, bone TB (including 18 spinal TB) was detected in 24 
      patients, joint TB in 14, and abscess in 3 (concurrent lesions in some patients). 
      The mean intervals from onset of symptoms to consultation (patients' delay), from 
      consultation to diagnosis (doctors' delay) and from symptom onset to diagnosis 
      (total delay) were 5.5 (13.9), 3.4 (5.2) and 8.9 (13.9) months, respectively. (1) 
      Bone/joint TB concurrent with miliary TB (N = 10) In 8 patients with mean age of 
      61.0 (17.4) yr, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs preceded respiratory symptoms or 
      appearance of miliary pattern on chest radiograph by 7.8 (7.2) (range; 1-24) months. 
      The patients', doctors' and total delays were 0.4 (0.5), 7.3 (7.8), and 7.7 (7.6) 
      months, respectively. In most cases, bone/joint TB was diagnosed after the onset of 
      miliary pattern on chest radiograph. In one patient with simultaneous onset of 
      musculo-skeletal and respiratory symptoms/signs (age 21 yr), the interval of total 
      delay was 1 month, and in one patient with musculoskeletal symptoms which appeared 
      six months later than respiratory symptoms (age 28 yr), the interval of total delay 
      was 2 months. (2) Bone/joint TB concurrent with active pulmonary TB (N = 19). In 
      this group, the mean age was 52.2 (17.1) yr, and males were predominant (M/F = 
      15/4). Active pulmonary TB was diagnosed by positive sputum culture in 13 patients, 
      by positive sputum smear or PCR results in 4 patients, and by the clinical course in 
      2 patients. Ten patients (53%) had a previous TB history. Cavitary lesion was 
      observed in 15 patients, and the upper lobes were predominantly involved on chest 
      radiograph in 19 patients, indicating that the pulmonary TB was probably 
      post-primary (reactivation) in all patients. In 9 patients with mean age of 49.7 
      (15.7) yr, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs preceded respiratory symptoms by 14.1 
      (14.0) (range; 4-48) months. The patients', doctors' and total delays were 13.3 
      (17.8), 3.8 (6.6), and 17.1 (16.1) months, respectively. On the other hand, in 10 
      patients with mean age of 54.5 (18.7) yr, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs and 
      respiratory symptoms/signs appeared simultaneously, and the total delay was 2.7 
      (1.9) months. Twelve of 19 patients (63%) had complications such as diabetes 
      mellitus, steroid use, and liver diseases. In cases with miliary or pulmonary 
      tuberculosis, the total delay in diagnosis (Y) correlates positively with the time 
      lag from onset of musculo-skeletal symptoms to respiratory symptoms/signs (X), and 
      the regression line (Y = 0.94X + 2.3, r = 0.98, p < 0.001) was almost linear (Y = 
      X), indicating that the diagnosis of bone/joint TB was made just after the diagnosis 
      of miliary or pulmonary TB. (3) Bone/joint TB concurrent with TB of other sites (N = 
      4) In 2 female cases (21 and 28 yrs) with cervical lymph node TB, musculo-skeletal 
      symptoms/signs and cervical lymph node swelling appeared simultaneously. In a 54-yr 
      male patient, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs appeared 5 years after appearance of 
      testicular enlargement, and testicular TB was diagnosed by biopsy simultaneously. In 
      a 33 year-old male patient, musculo-skeletal symptoms/signs appeared 7 months after 
      the drainage of pleural and pericardial effusions (TB was not diagnosed initially), 
      and then the diagnosis of bone/joint, pleural, and pericardial tuberculosis was made 
      for the first time. CONCLUSIONS: In middle-aged or elderly patients with active 
      bone/joint TB, miliary TB is sometimes caused by bacillemia originating from the 
      infected bone/joint lesions. In cases with bone/joint TB and concurrent pulmonary 
      TB, bone/joint TB and pulmonary TB are probably reactivated independently as a 
      result of decreased systemic immunocompetence.

TI  - Gene expression profile and immunological evaluation of unique hypothetical unknown 
      proteins of Mycobacterium leprae by using quantitative real-time PCR.
PG  - 181-90
LID - 10.1128/CVI.00419-12 [doi]
AB  - The cell-mediated immunity (CMI)-based in vitro gamma interferon release assay 
      (IGRA) of Mycobacterium leprae-specific antigens has potential as a promising 
      diagnostic means to detect those individuals in the early stages of M. leprae 
      infection. Diagnosis of leprosy is a major obstacle toward ultimate disease control 
      and has been compromised in the past by the lack of specific markers. Comparative 
      bioinformatic analysis among mycobacterial genomes identified potential M. 
      leprae-specific proteins called "hypothetical unknowns." Due to massive gene decay 
      and the prevalence of pseudogenes, it is unclear whether any of these proteins are 
      expressed or are immunologically relevant. In this study, we performed cDNA-based 
      quantitative real-time PCR to investigate the expression status of 131 putative open 
      reading frames (ORFs) encoding hypothetical unknowns. Twenty-six of the M. 
      leprae-specific antigen candidates showed significant levels of gene expression 
      compared to that of ESAT-6 (ML0049), which is an important T cell antigen of low 
      abundance in M. leprae. Fifteen of 26 selected antigen candidates were expressed and 
      purified in Escherichia coli. The seroreactivity to these proteins of pooled sera 
      from lepromatous leprosy patients and cavitary tuberculosis patients revealed that 9 
      of 15 recombinant hypothetical unknowns elicited M. leprae-specific immune 
      responses. These nine proteins may be good diagnostic reagents to improve both the 
      sensitivity and specificity of detection of individuals with asymptomatic leprosy.

PG  - 399-402
AB  - In a blind trial, alternate calves in six consecutive production batches of calves 
      (total 70), on a farm with a high incidence of respiratory and reproductive disease, 
      were allocated to treatment with either valnemulin or a placebo premix added to the 
      milk from four days of age. The calves were weighed at the beginning and end of a 
      21-day period of medication. Blood samples and nasal swabs were taken and examined 
      for the presence of Mycoplasma and Pasteurella species, and antibodies to viral 
      agents. Clinical condition, rectal temperature, respiratory and other signs and 
      refusals of milk were recorded daily. Dead calves were examined postmortem. The 
      calves medicated with valnemulin gained weight more quickly, had fewer cases of 
      Mycoplasma infection and fewer respiratory signs, and required fewer treatments with 
      antibiotics than those in the placebo group.

TI  - Selective enrichment and detection of mycobacterial DNA in paucibacillary specimens.
PG  - 220-9
AB  - A major challenge for tuberculosis control is mycobacterial detection in 
      paucibacillary disease, particularly in pediatric, extrapulmonary and smear-negative 
      pulmonary infections. We developed a simple and efficient DNA extraction and 
      real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocol for mycobacterial detection and 
      quantification in paucibacillary specimens. The method was refined using an in vitro 
      model mimicking blood specimens which are characterized by the presence of numerous 
      qPCR inhibitors. Mycobacterial DNA detection in blood is of interest given the high 
      sensitivity we previously reported using conventional PCR in blood of patients with 
      tuberculosis lymphadenitis. Mechanical lysis of mycobacteria in the presence of an 
      organic solvent provided the highest sensitivity. Mycobacterial DNA amplification 
      was compromised when the human:bacterial genome ratio was at least 190:1. Separation 
      of the specimen into bacterial- and host-rich fractions prior to DNA extraction 
      improved mycobacterial DNA detection by 30%. Preliminary testing of our protocol in 
      smear-negative, culture-positive specimens (gastric and lymph node aspirates, 
      pleural and cerebrospinal fluid, and blood) confirmed the applicability of our 
      technique to a range of paucibacillary specimens for the detection, quantification 
      and speciation (M. tuberculosis versus M. avium) of mycobacteria, several weeks 
      before culture results were available. Our protocol provides a novel, efficient and 
      simple strategy to improve the performance of qPCR in paucibacillary specimens, 
      including those with excess human DNA background. This tool is useful to study the 
      pathophysiology of early pulmonary or occult tuberculosis, and for more rapid and 
      accurate diagnosis in difficult to diagnose infections.

TI  - Regulatory T cells are expanded in blood and disease sites in patients with 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 803-10
AB  - RATIONALE: T-cell responses during tuberculosis (TB) help contain Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis in vivo but also cause collateral damage to host tissues. Immune 
      regulatory mechanisms may limit this immunopathology, and suppressed cellular immune 
      responses in patients with TB suggest the presence of regulatory activity. 
      CD4+CD25(high) regulatory T cells mediate suppressed cellular immunity in several 
      chronic infections but have not been described in TB. OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      whether regulatory T cells are increased in patients with TB and whether they 
      suppress cellular immune responses. METHODS: We compared the frequency of 
      circulating regulatory T cells in 27 untreated patients with TB and 23 healthy 
      control subjects using two specific markers: cell-surface CD25 expression and FoxP3 
      mRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: We detected a threefold increase in the frequency of CD4 + CD25(high) T 
      cells (p < 0.001) and a 2.2-fold increase in FoxP3 expression (p = 0.006) in 
      patients with TB, and there was a positive correlation between these markers (r = 
      0.58, p < 0.001). Increased expression of interleukin-10 and transforming growth 
      factor-beta1 mRNA was also detected in patients with TB but did not correlate with 
      regulatory T-cell markers. Ex vivo depletion of CD4 + CD25(high) cells from 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in increased numbers of M. tuberculosis 
      antigen-specific IFN-gamma-producing T cells in seven of eight patients with TB (p = 
      0.005). Finally, FoxP3 expression was increased 2.3-fold in patients with 
      extrapulmonary TB compared with patients with purely pulmonary TB (p = 0.01) and was 
      amplified 2.6-fold at disease sites relative to blood (p = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Regulatory T cells are expanded in patients with TB and may contribute to 
      suppression of Th1-type immune responses.

      immunoregulation in human allergy. To determine the local cytokine pattern of cells 
      present (both endogenous and recruited) at the site of disease, we extracted RNA 
      from skin biopsy specimens from patients with atopic dermatitis, allergic contract 
      dermatitis, and positive tuberculin reactions and used PCR to assay for cytokine 
      mRNA. cDNAs were normalized to the intensity of the CD3 delta PCR product as a 
      marker of T cell mRNA. We found overexpression of IL-10 mRNA in atopic dermatitis 
      lesions, in comparison with allergic contact dermatitis lesions and tuberculin 
      reactions. In contrast, IL-4 mRNA was most strongly expressed in allergic contact 
      dermatitis lesions and IFN-gamma mRNA was the predominant cytokine in tuberculin 
      reactions. Using an anti-IL-10 mAb with immunoperoxidase, we localized IL-10 protein 
      to large mononuclear cells in the dermal infiltrate of atopic lesions. After 
      immunomagnetic sorting of mononuclear cell populations from PBMC of atopic 
      dermatitis subjects, IL-10 mRNA as measured by PCR was found to be strongly 
      expressed in CD14+ cells. Spontaneous release of IL-10 from PBMC-derived adherent 
      cells was greater in atopic dermatitis donors than normal controls. We therefore 
      renormalized skin biopsy cDNA according to the level of beta-actin PCR product, as a 
      marker of total cellular mRNA, and found by PCR that IL-10 was nevertheless greatest 
      in atopic dermatitis subjects. We conclude that the relative overexpression of IL-10 
      in atopic dermatitis greatest in atopic dermatitis subjects. We conclude that the 
      relative overexpression of IL-10 in atopic dermatitis may contribute to the 
      up-regulation of humoral responses and the down-regulation of Th1 responses.

PG  - 16-20
AB  - The paper shows the latent activity of newly diagnosed intrathoracic tuberculosis in 
      the phase of calcification in children: clinical and X-ray changes, tuberculin 
      sensitivity (Manteaux test), the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) in the 
      sputum and blood (cultivation, bacterioscopy, polymerase chain reaction PCR), the 
      blood levels of acute-phase reagents: haptoglobin and alpha 1-protease inhibitor 
      (alpha 1-PI), immunological parameters, tuberculosis antibodies (TAb), and MBT 
      antigen. Ninety children were examined before treatment. Twenty-five children (Group 
      1) were found to have single minor calcified masses in one group of intrathoracic 
      lymph nodes or in the lung. Thirty-five children (Group 2) had multiple lymph nodes 
      or foci in the lung in the phase of consolidation and calcification. Thirty children 
      (Group 3, controls) were diagnosed as having intrathoracic tuberculosis in the phase 
      of infiltration. The signs of the latent activity of tuberculosis were detected in 
      all the children of all three groups, being more pronounced in Group 3. Thus, MBT 
      and TAb were revealed in 90% of the children in Group 3 and in 52.9 and 76.0% in 
      Groups 1 and 2, respectively. There were higher levels of alpha 1-PI in 96.6 and 
      75.0% in Groups 3 and 1, respectively. There were signs of intoxication in 80 and 
      88% and a hyperergic Mantoux reaction in 44.0 and 43.3%, respectively. The frequency 
      of the signs of activity did not greatly differ. Thus, children with newly diagnosed 
      respiratory tuberculosis in the phase of calcification should be regarded as having 
      the signs of tuberculosis activity, followed up as Group I patients, and prescribed 
      chemotherapy for 3-6 months or more, depending on the extent of the process.

AB  - Monitoring of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection may prevent disease. We 
      tested an ESAT-6 and CFP-10-specific IFN-γ Elispot assay (RD1-Elispot) on 163 
      HIV-infected individuals living in a TB-endemic setting. An RD1-Elispot was 
      performed every 3 months for a period of 3-21 months. 62% of RD1-Elispot negative 
      individuals were positive by cultured Elispot. Fluctuations in T cell response were 
      observed with rates of change ranging from -150 to +153 spot-forming cells 
      (SFC)/200,000 PBMC in a 3-month period. To validate these responses we used an 
      RD1-specific real time quantitative PCR assay for monokine-induced by IFN-γ (MIG) 
      and IFN-γ inducible protein-10 (IP10) (MIG: r=0.6527, p=0.0114; IP-10: r=0.6967, 
      p=0.0056; IP-10+MIG: r=0.7055, p=0.0048). During follow-up 30 individuals were 
      placed on ARVs and 4 progressed to active TB. Fluctuations in SFC did not correlate 
      with CD4 count, viral load, treatment initiation, or progression to active TB. The 
      RD1-Elispot appears to have limited value in this setting.

AB  - In spite of recent advances in diagnosis and chemotherapy of tuberculosis, prognosis 
      of tuberculosis of the central nervous system (CNS) is still poor. We evaluated 
      clinical characteristics of 14 patients with the CNS tuberculosis (10 male and 4 
      female, 21 to 71 years of age) who were hospitalized at IMCJ from 1988 to 1997. 
      Twelve patients had tuberculous meningitis (2 of them had also intracranial 
      tuberculoma), 1 had intracranial tuberculoma and 1 had spinal cord tuberculosis. For 
      the acid-fast bacilli, the smears of cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) were all negative 
      but the cultures for M. tuberculosis were positive in 5. Using PCR method, M. 
      tuberculosis was identified from CSF specimens in 2 out of 9 culture negative 
      patients, thus suggesting the usefulness of the PCR for the rapid diagnosis of CNS 
      tuberculosis. The adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in CSF may provide another 
      diagnostic clue because they were elevated in 8 out of 10 cases. It is to be noted 
      that there were three patients who developed clinical manifestations of CNS 
      tuberculosis after the initiation of chemotherapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. In the 
      last five cases, four-drug regimen which included PZA, was used with a good result. 
      The success could be related to the addition of PZA which penetrates blood-brain 
      barrier just as good as INH. Two patients died and one remains unconscious with 
      severe neurological sequelae. The present study indicates that positive CSF culture, 
      hydrocephalus and consciousness disturbance are important factors in determining 
      poor prognosis of the CNS tuberculosis.

TI  - Decreased expression of CD3zeta and nuclear transcription factor kappa B in patients 
      with pulmonary tuberculosis: potential mechanisms and reversibility with treatment.
PG  - 1385-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: The protective immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis relies 
      both on antigen-presenting cells and on T lymphocytes. In patients with different 
      forms of tuberculosis, varying degrees of T cell function--ranging from positive 
      delayed-type hypersensitivity, in asymptomatic infected healthy individuals, to the 
      absence of the response, in patients with miliary or pulmonary tuberculosis 
      (PTB)--have been reported. The decreased expression of CD3zeta reported in T cells 
      from patients with either cancer or leprosy has provided possible explanations for 
      the altered immune response observed in these diseases. METHODS: The present study 
      aimed to compare the expression of CD3zeta , nuclear transcription factor- kappa B 
      (NF- kappa B), arginase activity, and cytokine production in 20 patients with PTB, 
      in 20 tuberculin-positive asymptomatic subjects, and in 14 tuberculin-negative 
      control subjects. RESULTS: Compared with those in tuberculin (purified protein 
      derivative)-negative control subjects, peripheral-blood T lymphocytes from patients 
      with active PTB had significantly (P < .001) decreased expression of CD3zeta and 
      absence of the p65/p50 heterodimer of NF- kappa B. These alterations were reversed 
      only in patients who responded to treatment. Also reported here for the first time 
      is that the presence of arginase activity in peripheral-blood mononuclear-cell 
      lysates of patients with PTB parallels high production of interleukin-10. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence of arginase could, in part, explain the decreased 
      expression of CD3zeta . These findings provide a novel mechanism that may explain 
      the T cell dysfunction observed in patients with PTB.

PG  - 21-9
AB  - In a search for developing new skin test reagents, MPB70 protein antigen was a 
      candidate antigen for the Diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. First M. bovis BCG 
      genomic DNA was extracted purified and the mpb70 gene was amplified by PCR. The gene 
      was then ligated to an expression vector, PQE. After transformation of the 
      expression E. coil M15 host strain with the PQE plasmid, the expression was induced 
      using 10 mM of IPTG. Two bands were seen in the SDS-PAGE analysis the 44 and 50 KDa 
      represents the dimmers of the nonglycosylated and glycosylated form of the reMPB70 
      antigen. The His-tagged reMPB70 antigen was then purified by metal affinity 
      chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose. Protein refolding was done by the use of the co 
      solvent Polyethylene glycol MW 3000. The diagnostic potential of the re-MPB70 was 
      evaluated using sera from experimentally sensitized guinea pigs with different 
      strains of mycobacteria (M. bovis BCG, M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii and M. 
      intracellular) using ELISA test. The results indicated the efficiency of MPB70 but 
      not bovine PPD to discriminate between M. bovis sensitized guinea pigs and those 
      sensitized with other mycobacterial strains at serum dilution of 1150. In a field 
      trials to using reMPB70 antigen for the serodiagnosis of bovine tuberculosis using 
      ELISA test. Fifty serum samples from tuberculin +ve and 6 from tuberculin -ve cattle 
      were used as well as 10 tuberculin +ve buffaloes. All +ve animals were confirmed to 
      be M. bovis infected by P/M analysis, bacteriological examination. ELISA results 
      revealed that reMPB70 could recognize the tuberculin +ve infected animals at serum 
      dilution of 1/50 and that it could diagnose tuberculosis in cattle as well as 
      buffaloes.

AB  - Extrapulmonary tuberculosis accounts for approximately 10% of tuberculous 
      infections; the musculoskeletal system is involved in a small number of these (10%). 
      Skeletal tuberculosis is an indolent disease, and diagnosis may be delayed. 
      Conventional methods are time consuming and have a low sensitivity rate. In recent 
      years PCR-based protocols raised hopes as a reliable and fast diagnostic tool for 
      extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The authors report the detection of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis complex DNA in specimens from six patients using a nested PCR protocol 
      specific for IS6110 insertion element of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Three 
      men and three women are reported with ages ranging from 42 to 68 years. The sites of 
      infection were the knee and shoulder in one case each, the hip in two cases, and the 
      thoracic spine in two cases. Diagnosis was established within three days, and 
      treatment was initiated promptly. PCR is a technically easy approach that can be 
      used as a first step diagnostic tool for early recognition and treatment of bone and 
      joint tuberculosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A 55-year-old, HLA-B27-positive Finnish woman presented with migratory, 
      sterile polyarthritis. INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination, chest radiography, 
      serologic testing, microscopy, M. tuberculosis-specific interferon gamma 
      enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, smear and culture of synovial fluid for 
      acid-fast bacilli, and PCR. DIAGNOSIS: The patient's assayed blood and synovial 
      fluid lymphocytes were reactive, and the numbers of M. tuberculosis-specific T 
      cells, as determined by ELISPOT, were twofold to sixfold higher in synovial fluid 
      than in blood. Cultures for acid-fast bacilli remained negative, while PCR specific 
      for DNA of the M. tuberculosis complex was positive in synovial fluid cells. These 
      results suggested that the patient had either active or latent M. tuberculosis 
      infection. This finding, coupled with the presence of polyarthritis, led to a 
      diagnosis of Poncet disease. MANAGEMENT: Standard antituberculous therapy consisting 
      of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide was given for 2 months, followed by 
      isoniazid and rifampicin for 4 months. Inflamed joints were treated with 
      methylprednisolone injections. The polyarthritis resolved within 4 months of 
      initiating antituberculous therapy.

TI  - PCR detection of mycobacteraemia in tanzanian patients with extrapulmonary 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 813-7
AB  - In 191 Tanzanian patients admitted to hospital with suspected extrapulmonary 
      tuberculosis (TB), TB was diagnosed in 158 patients; the remaining 33 patients had 
      neither microbiological nor clinical evidence of TB. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was 
      detected in the blood of 25 patients, in 92% by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      technique and in 52% by culture of buffy coat cells. The presence of mycobacterial 
      DNA or Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria in peripheral blood (positive culture) 
      was significantly associated with HIV infection; it was detected in 22 (21.4%) of 
      103 HIV-seropositive patients compared to only 3 (3.5%) of 55 HIV-seronegative 
      patients (p < 0.009). In two-thirds of the patients with mycobacteraemia, TB can be 
      detected by simple smears from other organ sites. In patients with suspected 
      extrapulmonary tuberculosis in whom smears from the infected site are negative or 
      not available, PCR on blood will confirm the diagnosis within 24 hours in one third 
      of the cases.

      response to airborne Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in mice.
PG  - 1915-24
AB  - Mice immunized against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection by curing them of 
      a primary lung infection were compared with naive mice in terms of the ability to 
      generate a Th1 cell immune response and to control growth of an airborne Mtb 
      challenge infection. Immunized mice generated and expressed Th1 cell immunity 
      several days sooner than naive mice, as demonstrated by an earlier increase in the 
      synthesis in the lungs of mRNA for Th1 cytokines and for inducible nitric oxide 
      synthase, an indicator of macrophage activation. This Th1 cytokine/mRNA synthesis 
      was accompanied by an earlier accumulation of Mtb-specific Th1 cells in the lungs 
      and the presence of CD4 T cells in lesions. An earlier generation of immunity was 
      associated with an earlier inhibition of Mtb growth when infection was at a 1-log 
      lower level. However, inhibition of Mtb growth in immunized, as well as in naive, 
      mice was not followed by resolution of the infection, but by stabilization of the 
      infection at a stationary level. The results indicate that there is no reason to 
      believe that the secondary response to an Mtb infection is quantitatively or 
      qualitatively superior to the primary response.

TI  - The use of a Gamma-Interferon assay to confirm a diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in 
      Brazil.
PG  - 199-201
LID - 10.1016/j.actatropica.2009.10.002 [doi]
AB  - Control of bovine tuberculosis (TB) is currently based on slaughter of cattle deemed 
      positive on the basis of tuberculin testing; although the test has been broadly used 
      for several years, there are some disadvantages such as the need for holding animals 
      for 72 h. Besides it, test can lack both sensitivity and specificity depending on 
      the interpretation and the site of the PPD inoculation. Therefore, the objective of 
      the current study was to evaluate the use of the Gamma-Interferon (IFN) assay as a 
      confirmatory test in Brazil. A Comparative Intradermal Tuberculin Test (CITT) was 
      performed in 50 cows from a dairy herd known to be infected with TB. Blood samples 
      for IFN testing were collected concurrent with the CITT, as well as seven and 21 
      days later. At 30 days after the CITT, all cattle deemed reactive to this test were 
      slaughtered and samples were processed by both bacteriological culture and PCR. The 
      sensitivity of IFN as a diagnostic tool was 91.4%, whereas specificity was 86.7%. 
      When applied seven or 21 days after injection of PPD, sensitivity was 74.3 and 
      71.4%, respectively, whereas specificity was 86.7 and 80%. There was no significant 
      difference between the reliability of the IFN assay and the other standards, on all 
      three days of sampling. Therefore, we concluded that the IFN assay could be 
      effectively used as a confirmatory test seven or 21 days after injection of PPD.

PG  - 669-78
AB  - A 42-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with weight loss and right upper 
      quadrant abdominal pain. Though an 8cm mass in liver segment 5/8 was detected by 
      abdominal imaging, we could not confirm the diagnosis because findings on physical 
      examination, blood chemistry, and radiologic examination were nonspecific. No cancer 
      or immunocompromising diseases were found. We performed a liver biopsy because we 
      were suspicious of a cold abscess caused by tuberculosis. Purulent material acquired 
      from the biopsy revealed positive TB-PCR results, which confirmed the diagnosis of 
      solitary liver tuberculosis. She received anti-tuberculosis medications leading to 
      hepatic tumor resolution. There are very few reports of solitary liver tuberculosis 
      diagnosed without surgery, thus we report this case of a solitary tubercle diagnosed 
      by TB-PCR.

TI  - Cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis in the elderly: comparative diagnostic findings.
PG  - 1343-7
LID - 10.1017/S0022215109990880 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients suspected of having cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis are 
      diagnosed using investigations such as fine needle aspiration cytology and the 
      polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, these 
      investigations are intended for primary tuberculosis infection. The majority of 
      cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis cases in the elderly are thought to be caused by 
      reactivation. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were (1) to examine the efficacy of 
      fine needle aspiration cytology, polymerase chain reaction and blood tests in the 
      diagnosis of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis caused by reactivation, and (2) to 
      clarify any differences when compared with primarily infected cervical tuberculous 
      lymphadenitis cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three elderly patients with neck 
      lumps underwent excisional biopsy from 2003 to 2008. The efficacy of fine needle 
      aspiration cytology was examined by comparing the results of excisional biopsy with 
      those of fine needle aspiration cytology performed at the initial medical 
      examination for cases of suspected tuberculous disease. Furthermore, the leucocyte 
      count and C-reactive protein concentration were compared for cases of cervical 
      tuberculous lymphadenitis versus cases of malignant lymphoma. RESULTS: Although nine 
      cases were diagnosed with cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis using excisional 
      biopsy, only one of these had been suspected based on fine needle aspiration 
      cytology results. Three cases with tuberculous lymphadenitis were suspected of 
      having malignant lymphoma on initial examination. There was no significant 
      difference in the leucocyte count and C-reactive protein concentration, comparing 
      cases of tuberculous lymphadenitis versus malignant lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Unlike the 
      primary infection often seen in endemic areas, the diagnosis of early stage 
      tuberculous lymphadenitis of the swelling type caused by reactivation in elderly 
      people is difficult to confirm unless excisional biopsy is performed. In elderly 
      patients with neck lumps, cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis should be included in 
      the differential diagnosis.

AB  - A total of 188 children and adolescents were examined. In all the children, blood 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT) DNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) and MBT antigens (AG) and antibodies (AB) were by enzyme immunoassay. The 
      studies have shown that it is expedient to concurrently determine MBT DNA and MBT AT 
      in order to identify local forms of tuberculosis in children from risk groups. If 
      the tests are positive, a comprehensive examination for tuberculosis is required; 
      the presence of the syndrome of common disturbances is generally associated with 
      tuberculous infection. When a local form of tuberculosis is excluded, preventive 
      chemotherapy should be performed. Further negative tests for MBT DNA and lower MBT 
      AT may be a criterion for the efficiency of preventive treatment. In children with 
      tuberculosis, the results of repeated blood and urine tests for MBT DNA provide a 
      way of evaluating the course of a tuberculous process and the efficiency of 
      chemotherapy. PCR used to determine blood and urine MBT DNA is a highly specific 
      test as positive results were in 79% of the children with tuberculosis.

TI  - Effect of oral immunomodulator Dzherelo in TB/HIV co-infected patients receiving 
      anti-tuberculosis therapy under DOTS.
PG  - 845-51
LID - 10.1016/j.intimp.2008.01.029 [doi]
AB  - Open-label, phase II clinical trial was conducted in 40 HIV/TB dually infected 
      patients to evaluate the effect of oral immunomodulator Dzherelo on immune and viral 
      parameters. The anti-retroviral therapy naïve patients were randomized into two 
      equal groups to be given anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) under DOTS. The arm A, 
      which served as a control, received Isoniazid (H); Rimfapicin (R); Pyrazinamide (Z); 
      Streptomycin (S); and Ethambutol (E), and arm B received 50 drops of Dzherelo twice 
      per day in addition to the daily dose of HRZSE. After 2months the total CD3+ 
      lymphocytes increased from 728 to 921cells/microl (P=0.025) in Dzherelo recipients, 
      whereas in the control group they decreased from 651 to 585 cells (P=0.25). The 
      population of CD4 T-cells expanded in Dzherelo arm (174 to 283; P=0.00003) but 
      declined in ATT group (182 to 174; P=0.34). The CD8 cells fluctuated slightly upward 
      in both groups: 159>180 (P=0.17) and 159>183 (P=0.13). The ratio between CD4/CD8 
      cells deteriorated in arm A (1.213>0.943; P=0.002) but improved in arm B 
      (1.244>1.536; P=0.007). The percent of CD3+HLA-DR+ activated lymphocytes had fallen 
      in ATT group (22.6>20.5; P=0.004), but rose in Dzherelo recipients (21.5>30.5; 
      P=0.0001). The changes in CD20+ B lymphocytes were insignificant in both arms 
      (28.4%>28.6%; P=0.4) and (27.2%>26.7%; P=0.38). No difference was seen in the amount 
      of CD3-CD16+CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells in arm A (21.3%>22.6%; P=0.1), while in 
      Dzherelo recipients they declined significantly (19.9%>14.5%; P=0.0026). The viral 
      load, measured by plasma RNA-PCR, decreased in Dzherelo group (2174>1558; P=0.002), 
      but increased in ATT group (1907>2076 copies/ml; P=0.03). Dzherelo has a favorable 
      effect on the immune status and viral burden in HIV/TB patients when given as the 
      immunomodulating adjunct to ATT.

TI  - Mice deficient in CD4 T cells have only transiently diminished levels of IFN-gamma, 
      yet succumb to tuberculosis.
PG  - 5407-16
AB  - CD4 T cells are important in the protective immune response against tuberculosis. 
      Two mouse models deficient in CD4 T cells were used to examine the mechanism by 
      which these cells participate in protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      challenge. Transgenic mice deficient in either MHC class II or CD4 molecules 
      demonstrated increased susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, compared with wild-type 
      mice. MHC class II-/- mice were more susceptible than CD4-/- mice, as measured by 
      survival following M. tuberculosis challenge, but the relative resistance of CD4-/- 
      mice did not appear to be due to increased numbers of CD4-8- (double-negative) T 
      cells. Analysis of in vivo IFN-gamma production in the lungs of infected mice 
      revealed that both mutant mouse strains were only transiently impaired in their 
      ability to produce IFN-gamma following infection. At 2 wk postinfection, IFN-gamma 
      production, assessed by RT-PCR and intracellular cytokine staining, in the mutant 
      mice was reduced by >50% compared with that in wild-type mice. However, by 4 wk 
      postinfection, both mutant and wild-type mice had similar levels of IFN-gamma mRNA 
      and protein production. In CD4 T cell-deficient mice, IFN-gamma production was due 
      to CD8 T cells. Thus, the importance of IFN-gamma production by CD4 T cells appears 
      to be early in infection, lending support to the hypothesis that early events in M. 
      tuberculosis infection are crucial determinants of the course of infection.

TI  - Use of different molecular typing techniques for bacteriological follow-up in a 
      clinical trial with AIDS patients with Mycobacterium avium bacteremia.
PG  - 2503-10
AB  - One hundred ninety-six Mycobacterium avium isolates from blood samples recovered 
      from 93 AIDS patients for several months were typed by serotyping, by IS1245 
      restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and in some cases RFLP 
      analysis with plasmids pVT2 and pLR7 as probes, and by pulsed-field gel 
      electrophoresis (PFGE). PCR typing of single colonies was also used to detect 
      polyclonal infections. Strains belonged mainly to serotypes 1, 4, and 8. pVT2- and 
      pLR7-related plasmids were detected in strains from 49% of the patients. The IS1245 
      RFLP and PFGE analyses showed a 96.8% diversity of the M. avium strains from the 93 
      patients. The vast majority (95.2%) of infections were monoclonal, indicating that 
      recent infection is unlikely, even at an advanced stage of AIDS. For one patient, 
      sequential isolates gave divergent patterns of sensitivity and resistance to 
      clarithromycin, but all were identified as the initial clone. RFLP analysis and PCR 
      typing of single colonies allowed for the detection of three polyclonal infections 
      during the bacteriological follow-up. Among strains from patients whose samples were 
      positive by culture after treatment for 2 to 15 months, 97.4% were the same as the 
      initial strain. In conclusion, relapses and failures were mostly due to the initial 
      strain. These relapses and failures resulted either from the selection of resistant 
      mutants or the reappearance of sensitive strains, suggesting the persistence of 
      nonsterilized tissue reservoirs.

TI  - T-helper type 1/T-helper type 2 balance in malignant pleural effusions compared to 
      tuberculous pleural effusions.
PG  - 4030-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Malignant and tuberculous pleurisies are two major causes of 
      lymphocyte-dominant pleurisy. Several studies have already reported that tuberculous 
      pleurisy is a T-helper type 1(Th1)-dominant disease. In this study, we sought to 
      examine the Th1/T-helper type 2 (Th2) balance, especially focusing on the polarizing 
      status of T-cells to Th1/Th2 in malignant pleural effusions by measuring cytokines 
      in pleural effusions and by evaluating the polarizing status of T-cells on the point 
      of stimulation with interleukin (IL)-12 and/or IL-18. Furthermore, we evaluated 
      inhibitors of interferon (IFN)-gamma production in effusions to rule out the 
      possibility of direct inhibition of T-cell polarization. PATIENTS: Effusion samples 
      were collected from 19 patients with malignant pleurisy caused by lung cancer and 
      from 7 patients with tuberculous pleurisy. MEASUREMENTS: Concentrations of pleural 
      fluid IFN-gamma, IL-12, and IL-4 were measured. IFN-gamma production of T-cells 
      enriched from malignant pleural effusions in the presence of IL-12 and/or IL-18 was 
      also examined. We further compared the inhibitory activity of malignant pleural 
      effusions against IFN-gamma production and analyzed the expression of T-cell 
      immunoglobulin mucin, mucin domain (Tim-3), a Th1-specific molecule in pleural fluid 
      T-cells. RESULTS: Although malignant pleural effusions showed low levels of Th1 and 
      Th2 cytokines and ratios of IFN-gamma and IL-12 to IL-4 were low, isolated T-cells 
      produced a significant level of IFN-gamma in the presence of IL-12 and IL-18. 
      Soluble factors were not found to inhibit IFN-gamma production in malignant pleural 
      effusions. In tuberculous pleural effusion, ratios of IFN-gamma and IL-12 to IL-4 
      were significantly higher, and T-cells showed the expression of Tim-3 messenger RNA. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that T-cells in the malignant pleural effusions are mainly 
      naïve or not definitely polarized to Th1. Moreover, malignant tumor does not 
      actively distort the cytokine condition through production of soluble inhibitors 
      within effusions. The present study indicates that antitumor immunity may be 
      enhanced by restored IFN-gamma activity through combination of IL-12 and IL-18, and 
      that it will lead to new therapies for malignant effusion.

TI  - [Value of PCR in the diagnosis of tuberculosis in samples negative by direct 
      examination in HIV+ and HIV patients].
PG  - 165-7
AB  - A PCR system that amplify a repetitive fragment of the insertion sequence IS6110 
      specific for M. tuberculosis was compared to direct examination in samples from HIV+ 
      and HIV-patients. 138 clinical samples (90 sputa, 30 blood and 18 urines) were 
      analyzed in Senegal, a tuberculosis and HIV endemic area. All smear positive samples 
      were PCR positive except for 7/138 (5.07%) that were false negative because of the 
      presence of inhibitors. However, the use of several samples for each patient 
      minimize the false negative results. The PCR allowed the detection of more positive 
      results in smear negative sputa from HIV- (50%) than in HIV+ patients (20.5%). In 
      contrast, in smear negative blood samples, PCR was positive more frequently in HIV+ 
      (30%) than in HIV- patients (12.5%). Regarding patients, 15/25 HIV+ and 13/17 
      HIV-patients had at least one positive sample with PCR whereas only 7/25 and 11/17 
      respectively for HIV+ and HIV- patients had smear positive samples. Thus with some 
      technical cares, PCR might be a useful tool for rapid diagnosis of M. tuberculosis 
      infection in smear negative samples particularly in HIV+ patients.

PG  - 201-9
AB  - A mature bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) was diagnosed with mycobacterial 
      infection after being presented for an inability to fly, emaciation, and a swelling 
      of the left tibiotarsal-tarso metatarsal joint. Results of a complete blood cell 
      count revealed a persistent, marked leukocytosis, with heterophilia, monocytosis, 
      and anemia. Radiographs revealed lysis of the left distal tibiotarsus and 
      soft-tissue swelling around the left tibiotarsal-tarsometatarsal joint, multiple 
      pulmonary opacities, and an enlarged liver. Endoscopic evaluation and biopsy of 
      caseated material within the left caudal coelom revealed acid-fast organisms. The 
      eagle was euthanatized, and results of necropsy and histologic evaluation revealed 
      caseated granulomas of the intestine, lungs, air sacs, and subcutaneous regions of 
      the hock. Results of culture, a polymerase chain reaction testing, and direct 
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing for mycobacterial 16S ribosomal ribonucleic 
      acid DNA determined this organism most likely to be Mycobacterium avium.

AB  - A repetitive target sequences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA was amplified by 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a total of 301 clinical samples. Sputum, blood, 
      pleural fluid, and bronchial lavage specimen were taken from clinically suspected 
      causes of tuberculosis and processed for the diagnosis of tuberculosis using a 
      simplified procedure of DNA extraction. PCR was positive in a total of 58 samples 
      (58/301--19.3%). A significant number of smear and culture negative cases of 
      tuberculosis were PCR positive (37/174--21.26%). This finding, combined with the 
      absence of either false positive or false negative results reflects the greater 
      usefulness of this technique.

PG  - 109-15
LID - 10.1016/j.clim.2008.02.012 [doi]
AB  - Complement receptor 1 expressed on erythrocytes is involved in the transport of 
      circulating immune complexes from the circulation to the mononuclear phagocyte 
      system for safe disposal. The prevalence of complement receptor 1 genotypes and the 
      association between circulating immune complexes and expression of complement 
      receptor 1 on erythrocytes in pulmonary tuberculosis are not fully understood. 
      Observations from this study showed increased occurrence of HH genotype in patients 
      with pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients with tuberculosis had decreased erythrocyte 
      complement receptor 1 and increased immune complex levels compared to healthy 
      controls which also correlated with increasing severity of the disease. In addition, 
      the expression of complement receptor 1 on erythrocytes correlated inversely with 
      the levels of circulating immune complexes. This study suggests that the presence of 
      HH genotype is high in pulmonary tuberculosis patients and the reduced complement 
      receptor 1 in patients may be an acquired phenomenon related to disease 
      pathogenesis.

AB  - Proteins encoded by a 9.5-kb DNA segment, termed the region of difference (RD), of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis have been demonstrated to be important in bacterial 
      virulence, vaccine development and the design of diagnostic reagents. This study 
      evaluated the immunogenic properties of Rv3425, a member of the PPE family of 
      proteins, encoded by an open reading frame found in RD11 of M. tuberculosis, in 
      comparison with two other well-known antigens, the early secreted antigen target 6 
      (ESAT-6) and the 10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP-10). RT-PCR demonstrated that 
      Rv3425 mRNA is expressed in liquid culture by M. tuberculosis H37Rv. When tested in 
      a conventional ELISA in the form of a His-tagged recombinant protein, Rv3425 
      revealed a statistically significant antigenic distinction between healthy bacille 
      Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-vaccinated controls and tuberculosis (TB) patients (p 
      <0.0001). The anti-IgG response to recombinant Rv3425 was almost equal to that for 
      CFP-10, and was higher than that for ESAT-6. The results highlight the 
      immunosensitive and immunospecific nature of Rv3425, which shows promise for use in 
      the serodiagnosis of TB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A 63-year-old German woman with a 24-year history of Crohn's disease and 
      associated polyarthralgias presented with severe malaise, dyspnea, fever, night 
      sweats, dry cough and an extensive right-sided pleural effusion. The patient had 
      begun treatment with bi-weekly subcutaneous injections of adalimumab 5 weeks 
      earlier. INVESTIGATIONS: Physical examination, chest X-ray, transthoracic 
      ultrasonography, pleural tap and drainage, bacterial and cytological analyses of 
      pleural fluid, bronchoscopy, microscopy and bacteriological culture of pleural 
      exudates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, thoracic CT, thoracoscopy, histopathology 
      of pleural biopsy, tuberculin skin test, nucleic acid amplification of mycobacterial 
      RNA and DNA in the pleural fluid specimens and the parietal pleural biopsy, 
      microscopy of sputum samples, ESAT-6-specific and CFP-10-specific interferon-gamma 
      enzyme-linked immunospot assay on peripheral blood and pleural exudate mononuclear 
      cells. DIAGNOSIS: Pulmonary and pleural tuberculosis. MANAGEMENT: Cessation of 
      adalimumab treatment. Initiation of quadruple antibiotic therapy with isoniazid, 
      rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Prednisolone administered to reduce the 
      pleural effusion.

TI  - [Usefulness of a gene amplification technique (LCx MTB) in the diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis: preliminary results with different sputum samples].
PG  - 79-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use in non-sputum samples of a commercial molecular 
      amplification kit (LCx MTB, Abbott Diagnostica) (LCx) for the diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Ninety-nine non-sputum samples from the same 
      number of patients (bronchoalveolar, pleural and ascitic fluid, fecal samples, blood 
      cultures, biopsies from different sites, cerebrospinal fluid, urine and gastric 
      juices) and 14 sputum samples (10 from patients clinically suspected of having 
      tuberculosis and 4 from patients diagnosed of tuberculosis and undergoing 
      appropriate treatment for at least one month). All samples were LCx processed 
      according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reference diagnosis was obtained 
      by the Löwestein-jensen method and when results were inconsistent, we took into 
      account the degree of clinical suspicion, response to treatment and histology. 
      RESULTS: Seven of the 99 samples were positive by the LCx technique, and 6 of the 7 
      were also LJ positive; 1 could not be evaluated because of culture contamination. 
      One LJ positive culture was LCx negative. Only one sample was positive by 
      Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining. Ninety-two samples were LCx negative, with 91 showing 
      no growth at all. Sensitivity was 86% and specificity 98%. Atypical mycobacteria 
      were detected in 4 cases, all of which were LCx negative. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis by applying the LCx system to various types of samples other than 
      sputum is simple, rapid, sensitive and specific.

TI  - Pyothorax-associated lymphoma: a case showing transition from T-cell-rich 
      polymorphic lesion to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
PG  - 605-11
AB  - Pyothorax-associated lymphoma was found in a man who had a history of collapse 
      therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis about 50 years ago. An autopsy specimen revealed 
      histology of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with latency III Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 
      infection. However, an open biopsy 2 years and 7 months before death showed a 
      polymorphic appearance with abundant T-lymphocytes. Most of the EBV-infected 
      atypical lymphocytes did not express either B- or T-cell markers as far as examined 
      in the paraffin-embedded biopsy specimen, and rearrangements of immunoglobulin and 
      T-cell receptors were not found. It seemed difficult to diagnose a B-cell lymphoma 
      at the time of biopsy. However, retrospectively considered, if a phenotype of 
      EBV-infected atypical lymphocytes is uncertain in cases showing polymorphic 
      appearance, it might be better to consider the future evolution to overt B-cell 
      lymphoma. Since pyothorax-associated lymphoma shows latency III infection of EBV, at 
      least the immunohistochemistry of EBNA-2 and LMP-1 seems helpful for the diagnosis 
      to prove which cells are infected by EBV.

TI  - Proinflammatory cytokine profile in active kidney tuberculosis patients.
PG  - 277-85
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular pathogen 
      that developes specific T cell response expressed by the production of IL-12, 
      IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. The response has been quite well investigated in the 
      experimental models, however, there is little information about certain cytokine 
      levels in patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The shortage of data pertains 
      also to its most common form-kidney tuberculosis, especially when bacilli 
      dissemination into the blood circulation has occurred. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our 
      study was to examine simultaneously the frequency of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      presence in the blood circulation and the serum cytokine concentration during kidney 
      tuberculosis to approach their relationship in the clinical infection process. It is 
      considered that cytokine levels do not correlate with localisation of tuberculosis 
      (pulmonary vs. extrapulmonary), however, there is little information about the 
      cytokine levels in patients with kidney tuberculosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 30 
      patients attending the urology clinic with suspicion of kidney tuberculosis were 
      evaluated. Serum concentrations of selected cytokines in patients with urine, urine 
      and blood Mycobacterium tuberculosis presence were quantified by ELISA and compared 
      to PCR negative patient and group of healthy people. RESULTS: Our study demonstrates 
      the increase of TNF-alpha and IL-12 level in comparison to control group. TNF-alpha 
      concentration was about 2-fold higher in the positive patients than it was in 
      control group; IL-12 concentration was about 4-fold higher and the differences 
      between IL-12 levels were statistically important (p < 0.05). However, no 
      significant differences were found in IFN-gamma level among all groups. Using 
      Spearman correlation rank test, a significant correlation was found between 
      TNF-alpha and IL-12 in the positive patient group. The correlation factor was more 
      significant for the group of patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis present in 
      blood and urine than it was in urine positive PCR group (r = -0.66 vs. r = -0.51).

PG  - 661-4
AB  - A 38 year-old woman, without previous medical history, presented, since 1993, 
      several paraplegic fits carrying herself progressively through to a severe 
      paraplegia. Diagnoses successively proposed were spinal cord compressions by slipped 
      discs, spinal cord infarct and multiple sclerosis. In November 1998, the patient 
      presented back pain and fever. Spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed 
      a mildly enlarged dorsal cord with signal abnormalities. The lesions were isointense 
      on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images and showed a ringlike 
      contrast enhancement. A lumbar puncture showed a trouble cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
      with leucocytes 600/mm(3) (85 p.100 polynuclear), protein 6.7 g/l, glucose 0.26 g/l, 
      chloride 109 mmol/l. The patient was first treated with parenteral unspecific 
      antibiotherapy. Microbiological studies of blood and CSF were negative. CSF 
      examination with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive for Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis. Clinical (pain and fever) symptoms and CSF abnormalities decreased 
      after antituberculous treatment. However, paraparesis remain severe. Spinal 
      tuberculous localizations often lead to diagnostic and therapeutic errors. 
      Improvement of spinal cord MRI sequences and using of PCR technics in CSF would 
      contribute to reduce these difficulties.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dynamic cytokine profiles from endogenously activated T cells in transit 
      from lymph node to the infected sites via the blood compartment after recent 
      exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis may differentiate disease progressors from 
      non-disease progressors in a BCG-vaccinated population. METHODS: Household contacts 
      (N = 107) from families with (six families) or without (14 families) secondary cases 
      were assessed for Types 1 and 2 cytokines serially in plasma of whole blood cultures 
      without exogenous stimulation. "ARMS" PCR was carried out for detection of single 
      nucleotide polymorphism T/A in IFN-γ +874. RESULTS: In the absence of IFN-γ 
      expansion, raised IL-4 at 6 months was associated with disease progression in 
      TB-susceptible families. Resistant families on the other hand showed 
      overrepresentation of IFN-γ +874 A allele and expansion of IFN-γ secreting cells at 
      6 months followed by contraction at 12 months. CONCLUSION: Six months may be an 
      important checkpoint for biomarker assessment in high-risk individuals 
      post-exposure.

      unsteadiness, dysarthria, and clumsiness in writing over 6 months. There were 
      bilateral pyramidal signs, pseudobulbar palsy, and attention deficits. Cerebrospinal 
      fluid examination showed mild mononuclear pleocytosis, and magnetic resonance 
      imaging revealed pachymeningeal pattern of contrast enhancement beneath the 
      calvarium and the posterior cranial fossa. Interferon-gamma release assay in whole 
      blood after stimulation by specific tuberculosis antigens was positive and repeat 
      polymerase chain reaction assay detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome in the 
      cerebrospinal fluid. After combination therapy with anti-tuberculous agents and 
      corticosteroids, the patient's pachymeningitis regressed. Tuberculous cranial 
      pachymeningitis may present with chronic diffuse brain dysfunction without headache, 
      fever, or cranial nerve dysfunction.

TI  - Processing postmortem specimens with C18-carboxypropylbetaine and analysis by PCR to 
      develop an antemortem test for Mycobacterium avium infections in ducks.
PG  - 11-24
AB  - Mycobacterium avium is the causative agent of the avian mycobacteriosis commonly 
      known as avian tuberculosis (ATB). This infection causes disseminated disease, is 
      difficult to diagnose, and is of serious concern because it causes significant 
      mortality in birds. A new method was developed for processing specimens for an 
      antemortem screening test for ATB. This novel method uses the zwitterionic detergent 
      C18-carboxypropylbetaine (CB-18). Blood, bone marrow, bursa, and fecal specimens 
      from 28 ducks and swabs of 20 lesions were processed with CB-18 for analysis by 
      smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Postmortem examination 
      confirmed nine of these birds as either positive or highly suspect for disseminated 
      disease. The sensitivities of smear, culture, and PCR, relative to postmortem 
      analysis and independent of specimen type, were 44.4%, 88.9%, and 100%, 
      respectively, and the specificities were 84.2%, 57.9%, and 15.8%, respectively. 
      Reductions in specificity were due primarily to results among fecal specimens. 
      However, these results were clustered among a subset of birds, suggesting that these 
      tests actually identified birds in early stages of the disease. Restriction fragment 
      length polymorphism mapping identified one strain of M. avium (serotype 1) that was 
      isolated from lesions, bursa, bone marrow, blood, and feces of all but three of the 
      culture-positive birds. In birds with confirmed disease, blood had the lowest 
      sensitivity and the highest specificity by all diagnostic methods. Swabs of lesions 
      provided the highest sensitivity by smear and culture (33.3% and 77.8%, 
      respectively), whereas fecal specimens had the highest sensitivity by PCR (77.8%). 
      The results of this study indicate that processing fecal specimens with CB-18, 
      followed by PCR analysis, may provide a valuable first step for monitoring the 
      presence of ATB in birds.

PG  - 2441-7
AB  - To determine whether the Th1 response in tuberculosis correlated with IL-12R 
      expression, we measured expression of the IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2 subunits, 
      as well as IL-12R beta 2 mRNA expression in tuberculosis patients and healthy 
      tuberculin reactors. In tuberculosis patients, IFN-gamma production by Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis-stimulated PBMC was reduced, the percentages of T cells expressing 
      IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2 were significantly decreased, and IL-12R beta 2 mRNA 
      expression was also markedly reduced. In contrast, in pleural fluid and lymph nodes 
      at the site of disease in tuberculosis patients, in which IFN-gamma production is 
      enhanced, IL-12R beta 2 mRNA expression was also increased. In M. 
      tuberculosis-stimulated peripheral blood T cells from tuberculosis patients, 
      anti-IL-10 and anti-TGF-beta enhanced IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2 expression, 
      and IFN-gamma production. In M. tuberculosis-stimulated peripheral blood T cells 
      from healthy tuberculin reactors, recombinant IL-10 and TGF-beta reduced IL-12R beta 
      1 and IL-12R beta 2 expression, as well as IFN-gamma production. In combination with 
      prior studies showing increased production of TGF-beta by blood monocytes from 
      tuberculosis patients, this suggests that increased TGF-beta production is the 
      underlying abnormality that reduces IL-12R beta 1 and IL-12R beta 2 expression in 
      tuberculosis. Our findings provide evidence that IL-12R expression correlates well 
      with IFN-gamma production in human tuberculosis, and that expression of IL-12R beta 
      1 and IL-12R beta 2 may play a central role in mediating a protective Th1 response.

      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Presumptive diagnosis for tuberculous peritonitis was 
      made and antituberculous therapy resulted in the resolution of ascites and 
      normalisation of CA 125.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      DNA (MTB-DNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for diagnosis of 
      pulmonary tuberculosis. METHOD: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used 
      to amplify gene of 240 bp DNA fragment prepared by Triton X-100 method, and some 
      factors affecting PCR result were also analysed. RESULT: In blood samples of 89 
      patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and in sputum samples of 84 patients with 
      pulmonary tuberculosis, the positive rates of PCR were 73% and 57% respectively, and 
      the total positive rate of combinative detection of blood and sputum samples was 87% 
      in 84 pulmonary tuberculosis patients. In 30 non-tuberculosis patients, 3 showed 
      MTB-DNA positive. CONCLUSION: PCR technique prepared by Triton X-100 method is 
      rapid, simple, specific, and sensitive for detection of MTB-DNA in PBMC, and its 
      sensitivity and accuracy could be increased in combination with sputum MTB 
      examination. Detection of MTB-DNA in PMBC is of value in diagnosis of pulmonary 
      tuberculosis.

TI  - [Acute respiratory failure caused by tuberculosis].
PG  - 89-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Poland today, tuberculosis is rarely considered as a primary cause of 
      respiratory distress and/or multiple organ failure. We describe a case in which 
      tuberculosis was diagnosed after admission to the ICU following three months of 
      treatment at various health facilities. CASE REPORT: A 13-yr-old boy was admitted to 
      the ICU with acute respiratory distress due to a right-sided multi-focal pneumonia, 
      pleural effusion, and mediastinitis. He also had acute renal failure and was in 
      shock. He had been treated for three months with various antibiotics. A skin TB-test 
      was negative, as were blood and sputum cultures. Mediastinoscopy revealed enlarged 
      lymph nodes in the anterior and posterior mediastinum and in the right pulmonary 
      hilus. A lymphoma was suspected and steroids were commenced.The boy was critically 
      ill, requiring mechanical ventilation (PIP 46 cm H2O, PEEP +7), extensive inotropic 
      support and fluid resuscitation. By using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 
      material from a bronchial lavage, infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was 
      revealed, and anti-TB multi drug treatment was instituted (oral pyrazinamide, 
      ethambutol, isoniazide and iv rifampicin). The oral treatment was complicated by 
      dysenteric diarrhea, so enteral drugs were stopped and streptomycin instituted. 
      Intravenous isoniazide was reinstituted later because of TB-meningitis. The 
      treatment resulted in steady improvement and the boy was discharged from the ICU 
      after 6 weeks of treatment. Six months later he was discharged home in a 
      satisfactory condition, without signs of neurological damage. CONCLUSION: 
      Tuberculosis can be very difficult to diagnose and may lead to multiple organ 
      failure. PCR tests of specimens taken from affected body areas, should be made as 
      early as possible.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of an in-house IS6110 polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 859-67
AB  - The aim of this study was to clinically validate a heminested polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) method, based on the IS6110 insertion segment of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis complex, for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Samples of pulmonary, 
      extrapulmonary and blood origin were collected prospectively from 331 patients. All 
      samples were processed to detect acid-fast bacilli by direct stain, culture and PCR. 
      The gold standard comparison was a clinically based final case definition of 
      tuberculosis corresponding to group 3 of the American Thoracic Society's 
      classification system. The sensitivities of stain, culture and PCR were 41%, 65% and 
      59%, respectively. Overall specificity exceeded 97% for all techniques. The 
      combination of PCR and direct stain achieved a sensitivity similar to that of 
      culture alone. The PCR method detected 74 of 95 (78%) culture-positive results. In a 
      hospital setting, PCR could be a useful, reliable tool for diagnosis of tuberculosis 
      and may be introduced as a complementary routine diagnostic laboratory method.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical diagnostic value of TaqMan-PCR technique in the 
      diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: The specimens of sputum and 
      peripheral blood from 168 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, 57 patients 
      with lung cancer and the specimens of peripheral blood from 34 healthy individuals 
      were detected by TaqMan-PCR, PCR. The specimens of sputum were also detected by 
      smear, culture with BACTEC and Lowenstein-Jensen for comparison. RESULTS: The 
      positive rates of sputum and peripheral blood detected by TaqMan-PCR were 53.0% and 
      61.3%, respectively, significantly higher than those of PCR, smear, culture with 
      BACTEC and Lowenstein-Jensen (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between 
      TaqMan-PCR and PCR for specificity (P > 0.05). Of 105 specimens of peripheral blood 
      from patients with smear-negative and culture-negative pulmonary tuberculosis, 48 
      specimens of peripheral blood detected by TaqMan-PCR were positive. The positive 
      rate was 45.7%. CONCLUSIONS: TaqMan-PCR method showed higher sensitivity and 
      specificity. It is an useful tool for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis, 
      particularly smear-negative and culture-negative pulmonary tuberculosis.

AB  - The numerous extrapulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis have been well described. 
      Intracranial localizations, including brain stem tuberculoma, are very rare. The 
      authors report a case of brain tuberculoma in a patient with a history of primary 
      pulmonary tuberculosis successfully treated more than twenty years earlier. The 
      patient presented with signs of infection, although the fever disappeared 
      temporarily after successive treatments for malaria (confirmed Plasmodium 
      faiciparum), as well as neurological signs with left hemiparesis. Chest radiographs 
      showed no signs of progressive pulmonary tuberculosis, and blood tests, 
      cerebrospinal fluid testing, and HIV serology were all negative. Treatments for 
      maxillary sinusitis, the malaria, bacterial meningitis, and cerebral abscess were 
      equally ineffective. Brain stem tuberculoma was diagnosed only when the patient was 
      transferred to a hospital equipped with neuroimaging equipment and was confirmed 
      after histopathological examination of the intracranial lesion biopsies and the 
      detection of mycobacterium DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the 
      cerebrospinal fluid. A review of 147 cases of intracranial tuberculoma reported in 
      Africa between 1985 and 2001 points out the difficulties of both the differential 
      diagnosis (tuberculoma or other intracranial space-occupying lesions) and treatment 
      in African areas where neuroimaging is unavailable. Our patient's brainstem 
      tuberculoma probably resulted from reactivation of latent tuberculosis.

TI  - Coadministration of interleukin 2 plasmid DNA with combined DNA vaccines 
      significantly enhances the protective efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
PG  - 605-13
AB  - Coadministration of interleukin 2(IL-2) plasmid DNA with combined DNA vaccines 
      enhanced Th1-type cellular responses by producing higher amounts of IFN-gamma with a 
      higher ratio of antigen-specific IgG2a/IgG1. The IFN-gamma specific for Ag85B, 
      MPT64, and MPT83 in this group was 415, 267, and 255 U/ml, respectively, and was 
      1.6-, 1.8-, and 2.5-fold higher than that of the same vaccine without adding IL-2. 
      The IgG2a/IgG1 ratio for Ag85B, MPT64, and MPT83 was 4, 8, and 4, respectively, upon 
      addition of the genetic adjuvant in the DNA vaccine, which was four times higher for 
      every antigen when IL-2 was not included. Fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) 
      analysis showed that, in the presence of IL-2, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells increased 
      significantly, whereas in the absence of the genetic adjuvant, only a mild increase 
      was observed for CD8+ T cells compared to the vector DNA-treated group. Bacterial 
      CFU was reduced to less than 1/100 in the lung and to about 1/10 in the spleen 
      relative to the same combined DNA vaccine without IL-2. The lungs of this group of 
      mice showed much less damage due to an influx of epithelioid macrophages and less 
      lymphocytes. RT-PCR showed that antigen genes could be detected in more organs and 
      for a longer period of time when treated with combined DNA vaccine formulated in 
      IL-2. We suggest that IL-2 enhanced the immunigencity and protective efficacy in 
      immunized mice by improving the Th1-type response and also by prolonging the antigen 
      gene expression in different organs.

TI  - Comparative study of amplicor Mycobacterium PCR and conventional methods for the 
      diagnosis of pleuritis caused by mycobacterial infection.
PG  - 871-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical significance of the Amplicor Mycobacterium system 
      for the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection in patients with pleural fluid, and to 
      compare its usefulness with that of conventional smear and culture methods. DESIGN: 
      Pleural fluid specimens were obtained randomly from in-patients admitted to National 
      Tokyo Hospital between January and December 1996. All the patients were diagnosed 
      with bacterial, histopathological and clinical gold standard. The sensitivity and 
      specificity for diagnosis of mycobacterial infection were evaluated. RESULTS: 
      Seventy-five pleural fluid specimens were obtained. Conventional methods 
      demonstrated a sensitivity of 30.6% and a specificity of 100%, while the Amplicor 
      Mycobacterium demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 27.3% and 97.6% 
      respectively. Lactic dehydrogenase, carcinoembryonic antigen, red blood cell, 
      protein, glucose and types of inflammatory cells were not different in Amplicor 
      positive and negative pleural fluid with mycobacterial infection. CONCLUSION: There 
      was not much improvement in the accuracy of diagnosis when Amplicor Mycobacterium 
      was used to diagnose mycobacterial pleuritis among various diseases with pleural 
      fluid; however, the assay time was dramatically reduced with the use of Amplicor 
      Mycobacterium.

TI  - Asymptomatic homozygous deletional beta(0)-thalassemia in an African individual.
PG  - 232-6
AB  - Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for beta(0)-thalassemia mutations most 
      commonly results in a transfusion-dependent thalassemia major phenotype. In this 
      report, we describe a 55-year-old male, from Guinea-Bissau, that had been 
      asymptomatic and never transfused until being admitted to hospital with anemia, 
      fever, splenomegaly, and asthenia. Following hospital admission, HIV-2 and 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were diagnosed, and biochemical and molecular 
      studies revealed homozygosity for beta(0)-thalassemia. At the molecular level, this 
      is the first description of homozygosity for the beta(0)-Black 1,393-bp deletion. In 
      this case, the complete absence of beta-globin gene expression seems to be 
      compensated by an unusually high fetal globin gene expression (Hb F 96%). 
      Beta-globin haplotyping results were compatible with the propositus being homozygous 
      for the Black 2 haplotype and for the absence of the XmnI polymorphism at -158 of 
      (G)gamma-globin gene (-/-). Co-inheritance of genetic factors usually associated 
      with high Hb F levels was not detected. Otherwise, the propositus is a heterozygote 
      for the alpha-globin gene 3.7-kb deletion that is a beneficial modulating factor but 
      not sufficient to explain this extremely mild phenotype. This unusual 
      genotype/phenotype association is discussed in terms of the mechanisms underlying 
      hemoglobin switching during development.

      rejection of other reasons, tuberculin sensitivity, reduction or disappearance of 
      the intoxication in antituberculous treatment, negative results of repeated PCR for 
      M-tuberculosis gave grounds to suspect active tuberculosis in 13 children of 16. 
      Clinical and x-ray picture corresponded to tuberculous intoxication in children and 
      adolescents.

TI  - Cloning and sequencing of badger (Meles meles) interferon gamma and its detection in 
      badger lymphocytes.
PG  - 19-30
AB  - The European badger (Meles meles) has been identified as a reservoir for 
      Mycobacterium bovis and is implicated in the maintenance and transmission of 
      tuberculosis in cattle. There is a need for a sensitive test of M. bovis infection 
      in badgers and the current serodiagnostic test used for this purpose has low 
      sensitivity. As observed for other species, assay of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) 
      produced in response to M. bovis antigens is a more sensitive test of tuberculosis. 
      With this objective in sight, we report the first step in the development of an 
      ELISA for badger IFNgamma. The badger IFNgamma gene was cloned and sequenced and 
      used to generate a specific polyclonal antibody to the cytokine. The gene sequence 
      demonstrated regions that were conserved within the IFNgamma genes of other mammals. 
      The badger sequence was most similar to the canine, showing similar structural 
      organisation of the gene and 88% amino acid identity. Rabbits were immunised with 
      DNA encoding badger IFNgamma and the resulting polyclonal antiserum demonstrated 
      specificity for canine IFNgamma by immunoblot of a commercial recombinant canine 
      IFNgamma. The antiserum was used to detect intracellular badger IFNgamma by flow 
      cytometry analysis of badger lymphocytes stimulated with mitogen.

LID - 10.3343/kjlm.2009.29.3.194 [doi]
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cell neoplasms are a group of rare but highly malignant tumors. 
      We report here one case of NK cell leukemia. A 54-yr-old woman presented with a 
      2-month history of progressive left neck mass. Based on the positive result of 
      tissue PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, she was at first diagnosed with 
      tuberculous lymphadenopathy. After two weeks, she developed generalized 
      lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, fever and anemia. Subsequent evaluation was 
      performed including bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Peripheral blood smear showed 
      leukoerythroblastic features with 31% blasts. Bone marrow was packed with agranular 
      blastoid cells, which were periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive and myeloperoxidase 
      (MPO) negative. Immunophenotyping showed that these cells were positive for CD45 and 
      HLA-DR, whereas negative for CD3, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD13, CD14, CD19, CD20, CD22, 
      CD33, CD34, and CD61. Because of the absence of the markers of T-cell, B-cell, and 
      myeloid lineage-specific antigens, we added CD16/56 for the immunophenotyping and 
      the blasts were positive (94%). The tumor cells of biopsied lymph node were only 
      positive for CD56, consistent with NK cell lymphoma. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was 
      not detected by RNA in situ hybridization. Culture for M. tuberculosis was negative. 
      Thus this patient was diagnosed with blastic NK cell lymphoma/leukemia involving 
      bone marrow and lymph node.

TI  - Molecular and histopathologic evidence for systemic infection by Mycobacterium bovis 
      in a patient with tuberculous enteritis, peritonitis, and meningitis: a case report.
PG  - 302-7
AB  - Mycobacterium bovis infection has been reported in several patients with AIDS in 
      other countries. The prevalence of tuberculosis in Taiwan is higher than the World 
      Health Organization standard. However, reports of M. bovis infection are rare. A 
      47-year-old male had the habit of drinking uncooked fresh deer's blood and 
      unpasteurized deer's milk. He suffered from acute abdominal pain and underwent 
      emergency laparotomy. Pathology demonstrated tuberculosis enteritis with colon 
      perforation. The molecular diagnosis by nested polymerase chain reaction assay and 
      single-strand conformation polymorphism assay showed M. bovis infection in the small 
      intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Our results 
      suggest that the most likely portal of entry of M. bovis is the gastrointestinal 
      rather than the respiratory tract. Ingested M. bovis from unpasteurized deer's milk 
      probably entered the mucosal macrophages of the intestine and then the draining 
      mesenteric lymph nodes. As immunity declined, bacilli from the mesenteric lymph 
      nodes disseminated to other organs and into the CSF.

AB  - An 80-year-old woman suffered from fever and loss of appetite. Her chest X-ray 
      showed mediastinal tumors and diffuse granular shadows in the bilateral lung fields. 
      Elevations of sIL-2r and M-protein were present. HRCT showed numerous small granules 
      in both lungs and mediastinal lymph node enlargement. Tuberculosis DNA was detected 
      by PCR in her sputum. Later, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from her 
      sputum. After she started anti-tuberculosis therapy, her general fatigue and 
      elevation of sIL-2r improved gradually. Her chest X-ray revealed a decrease in the 
      size of mediastinal lymph nodes and small granules.

TI  - AMPLICOR MTB polymerase chain reaction test for identification of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis in positive Difco ESP II broth cultures.
PG  - 17-20
AB  - The reliability of the Roche AMPLICOR polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (MTB) test for identification of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in 
      Difco ESP II broth cultures was evaluated by testing aliquots from all cultures, 
      regardless of specimen type, that were signaled positive by the ESP instrument. 
      Polymerase chain reaction results were compared to those obtained by usual 
      laboratory protocol, whereby MTBC was identified by DNA probe (Gen Probe, Inc., San 
      Diego, California, USA), testing sediment from broth samples or colonies on a solid 
      medium. Of the 242 signal-positive ESP II cultures (from 182 patients) evaluated, 98 
      (40.5%) contained mycobacteria, including 26 MTBC. On initial testing, 27 samples 
      were positive by PCR; 22 of these were MTBC culture positive, and 5 were culture 
      negative for mycobacteria. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative 
      predictive values of PCR were 84.6, 97.7, 81.5, and 98.1%, respectively. Based on 
      review of the medical records of the patients for whom PCR and culture results were 
      discrepant, one PCR-positive culture negative was a true PCR positive; thus the 
      actual sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of PCR 
      were 85.2, 98.1, 85.2, and 98.1%. Two of the PCR-negative, MTBC culture-positive 
      samples were blood specimens collected in an Isolator tube; and these tubes contain 
      sodium polyanetholsulfonate, which seems to inhibit PCR. If blood specimens are 
      excluded from analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative 
      predictive values for PCR are 92.0, 97.6, 85.2, and 98.8%, respectively. The mean 
      times from specimen receipt to identification of MTBC were 19 (+/- 2) days (range, 6 
      to 39 days) for ESP II plus AMPLICOR MTB PCR and 25 (+/- 2) days (range, 8 to 42 
      days) for DNA probe testing of sediment from broth or colonies on solid media (p < 
      .05). These data indicate that the AMPLICOR MTB PCR test is a rapid, reliable method 
      for identification of MTBC in positive ESP II cultures, excluding blood specimens 
      collected in Isolator tubes.

TI  - [Clinical application of testing methods on acid-fast bacteria].
PG  - 95-111
AB  - Clinical bacteriology pertaining to acid-fast bacteria has made marked advances over 
      the past decade, initiated by the development of a DNA probe kit for identification 
      of acid-fast bacteria. Wide-spread use of nucleic acid amplification for rapid 
      detection of tubercle bacillus contributed more greatly than any other factor to 
      such advances in this field. At present, 90% of all kits used for nucleic acid 
      amplification in the world are consumed in Japan. Unfortunately, not a few 
      clinicians in Japan have a false idea that the smear method and nucleic acid 
      amplification are necessary but culture is not. In any event nucleic acid 
      amplification has exerted significant impacts on the routine works at bacteriology 
      laboratories. Among others, collecting bacteria by pretreatment with NALC-NaOH has 
      simplified the introduction of the collective mode smear method and liquid media. 
      Furthermore, as clinicians have become increasingly more experienced with various 
      methods of molecular biology, it now seems possible to apply these techniques for 
      detection of genes encoding drug resistance and for utilization of molecular 
      epidemiology in routine laboratory works. Meanwhile, attempts to diagnose acid-fast 
      bacteriosis by checking blood for antibody have also been made, primarily in Japan. 
      At present, two kits for detecting antibodies to glycolipids (LAM, TDM, etc.) are 
      covered by national health insurance in Japan. We have an impression that in Japan 
      clinicians do not have adequate knowledge and skill to make full use of these new 
      testing methods clinically. We, as the chairmen of this symposium, hope that this 
      symposium will help clinicians increase their skill related to new testing methods, 
      eventually leading to stimulation of advances in clinical practices related to 
      acid-fast bacteria in Japan. 1. Smear microscopy by concentration method and broth 
      culture system: Kazunari TSUYUGUCHI (Clinical Research Center, National Hospital 
      Organization Kinki-chuo Chest Medical Center) Smear microscopy and culture still 
      remain the cornerstone to diagnose tuberculosis. However, the classical methods in 
      Japan using direct microscopy and Ogawa solid media were not sufficient for clinical 
      use. In recent years substantial advance has been made in these fields. 
      Concentration of clinical samples by centrifugation improves the sensitivity of 
      smear microscopy with excellent reproducibility. The Mycobacteria Growth Indicator 
      Tube (MGIT) system using liquid media yields high sensitivity and rapidity. Using 
      these methods, more and more tuberculosis cases would be correctly diagnosed and 
      treated adequately based on drug susceptibility testing. 2. New technologies for 
      anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing: Satoshi MITARAI (Bacteriology 
      Division, Reference Centre for Mycobacterium, Research Institute of Tuberculosis, 
      Japan Anti-Tuberculosis Association) Several new technologies have been developed to 
      obtain anti-tuberculosis drug susceptibility testing (AST) results rapidly, 
      utilising liquid culture and molecular technologies. Mycobacterium Growth Indicator 
      Tube (MGIT), as a popular liquid culturing and AST system, was evaluated for its 
      accuracy and usefulness. As for isoniazid, MGIT showed 12.6% of discordant result 
      comparing with standard method. These MGIT resistant and Ogawa susceptible strains 
      had relatively high MICs ranging 0.13 to 2.0 microg/ml. The molecular detection of 
      resistant gene mutation is also a useful method to estimate drug resistance rapidly. 
      The rpoB mutation detection is reliable with high sensitivity and specificity. 3. 
      Nucleic acid amplification and novel diagnostic methods: Shunji TAKAKURA (Department 
      of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine) 
      Sensitivities of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for the diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis meet clinical requirement that patients with high-risk of transmission 
      should be identified within a day. Comparison of the performance of various NAATs is 
      difficult because of the difference in sample processing and in samples tested among 
      methods and reports. Considering the limitations of NAATs (low sensitivity compared 
      with culture, inability to differentiate dead bacilli from the living), further 
      advances would be expected when novel technologies could confer additional 
      information, such as drug susceptibility, quantity, viability, and genotype. 4. 
      Serodiagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex lung disease: Seigo KITADA (Department 
      of Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Toneyama National Hospital) 
      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) organisms are ubiquitous in environment and a 
      contamination in respiratory tracts is sometimes observed, and that complex the 
      diagnosis. We developed a serodiagnostic method for MAC disease using an enzyme 
      immunoassay with the MAC-specific glycopeptidolipid (GPL) core as antigen. A 
      significant increase in GPL core antibodies was detected in sera of patients with 
      MAC pulmonary diseases compared to patients who were colonized with MAC, patients 
      with M. kansasii disease and tuberculosis and healthy subjects. The serodiagnosis is 
      useful for diagnosis of MAC lung disease. 5. Molecular epidemiologic tools for 
      tuberculosis: IS6110 RFLP, Spoligotyping, and VNTR: Tomoshige MATSUMOTO, Hiromi ANO, 
      Tetsuya TAKASHIMA, Izuo TSUYUGUCHI (Osaka Prefectural Medical Center for Respiratory 
      and Allergic Diseases) We have performed molecular typing on about 1,300 culture 
      positive clinical isolates that made up the majority of tuberculosis strains in part 
      of southeast Osaka since 2001 until now. By spoligotyping, about 75% of entire 
      strains belonged to the Beijing strain. Particular spoligotyping descriptions, which 
      were not described in SpolDBIII, were found in the strains with lower than 6 copies 
      of IS6110 RFLP. We described them as Osaka type. We could also show that direct 
      typing from Tb PCR positive sputum of patients with tuberculosis was possible by 
      VNTR and that VNTR with 16 loci was useful in tuberculosis typing in Osaka.

TI  - Identification of Mycobacterium bovis in bovine clinical samples by PCR 
      species-specific primers.
PG  - 101-6
AB  - Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis is emerging as the most important 
      disease affecting cattle. Furthermore, it results in a major public health problem 
      when transmitted to humans. Due to its difficult and non-specific diagnosis, M. 
      bovis has been declared to be one of the etiologic agents causing significant 
      economic loss in the cattle industry. Our group evaluated a more rapid and specific 
      method, based on a new polymerase chain reaction species-specific primers, which 
      amplifies a 470-base pair fragment of the M. bovis genome. A total of 275 
      milk-producing cows were studied by intradermal tuberculin test (ITT) which gave 184 
      positive and 91 negative cases. From them, 50 animals were taken from a cattle ranch 
      free of tuberculosis. Three different samples were collected from each animal 
      (blood, nasal mucus, and milk). Positive results were obtained from 26 animals by 
      PCR (11.4%), 1 by bacteriological culturing (0.4%) and 1 by bacilloscopy (0.4%). 
      This finding suggests, as in previous reports, that ITT, normally used for bovine 
      tuberculosis detection, has the inconvenience of having a broad range of specificity 
      and sensitivity, and the PCR technique is a more specific and sensitive test to 
      detect infection associated with M. bovis. Therefore, we propose this PCR assay as a 
      useful tool in the epidemiological characterization of infected animals in areas 
      considered to be at high risk of transmission.

TI  - [Association of hypercalcemia, elevated levels of calcitriol and tuberculosis in 
      patients on hemodialysis].
PG  - 448-54
AB  - Hypercalcemia is associated with numerous chronic granulomatous processes and 
      chronic infections. Increased production of calcitriol by activated macrophages has 
      been shown to be the cause in most cases. In this article, we describe three cases 
      of hypercalcemia associated with inappropriately elevated calcitriol levels and 
      suppressed PTH in hemodialysis. In addition to conventional techniques for 
      tuberculosis diagnosis we used Ligase Chain Reaction (LCR) to detect mycobacterial 
      DNA in pleural effusion with acid-fast stain and culture negativity. Antituberculous 
      therapy was associated with a decrease in the levels of calcium, as well as in serum 
      calcitriol concentrations, and a substantial increase in the levels of iPTH. The 
      serum levels of 25(OH)D3 remained unchanged. These findings suggested ectopic 
      production of calcitriol. The discussion reviews the previously reported cases of 
      hypercalcemia and tuberculosis that occurred during hemodialysis, and concludes that 
      ectopic production of calcitriol by tuberculous granulomas is extremely unusual and 
      its demonstration requires a high index of suspicion. Molecular techniques are a 
      potentially useful approach for early and rapid diagnosis of tuberculous infection 
      in dialysis patients.

PG  - 259-62
AB  - Two cases (a 33-year-old woman and a 34-year-old man) were diagnosed as having 
      cerebral tuberculosis. Case 1 was tuberculoma with miliary tuberculosis complicating 
      cranial nerve palsies, and case 2 was tuberculous meningitis. Early diagnosis was 
      difficult, because smear and PCR were negative. Culture was finally positive after 
      several weeks. QuantiFERON were positive prior to the culture results in both cases. 
      This reaction suggested tuberculous infection. QuantiFERON is useful for diagnosing 
      cerebral tuberculosis at an early stage.

TI  - Activation of an interleukin-4 mRNA-producing population of peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells after infection with Mycobacterium bovis or vaccination with 
      killed, but not live, BCG.
PG  - 269-74
AB  - This study examines the expression of mRNA for the Th2 cytokine, interleukin-4 
      (IL-4). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from deer infected with Mycobacterium 
      bovis or vaccinated with live or killed M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) were 
      cultured with mycobacterial antigens. IL-4 mRNA production was assayed using the 
      polymerase chain reaction. Elevated levels of IL-4 mRNA were detected in response to 
      at least one antigen preparation in all animals infected with M. bovis as compared 
      with none of the non-infected control animals. After a primary immunization, 
      elevated levels of IL-4 mRNA were detected in only a proportion of vaccinated 
      animals and this did not correlate with whether the vaccine was live BCG or killed 
      BCG in oil. After boosting, all the animals vaccinated with killed BCG in oil 
      exhibited elevated IL-4 mRNA production whereas none of the animals vaccinated with 
      live BCG showed elevated levels. The data suggest that IL-4 is turned off during the 
      immune response to live BCG, that boosting of low-dose live BCG vaccine may be 
      required to 'imprint' this signal and that this may be important in the development 
      of protective immunity to tuberculosis. Killed BCG in adjuvant is not protective and 
      as with experimental infection with virulent M. bovis it failed to switch off the 
      IL-4 response. IL-4 may be useful as a diagnostic tool and as an in vitro marker of 
      vaccine efficacy.

TI  - [A case of miliary tuberculosis presenting with acute resiratory distress syndrome].
PG  - 195-9
AB  - An 87-year-old woman was admitted because of high fever, progressive dyspnea and 
      abnormal shadows on chest roentgenogram. Laboratory investigation on admission 
      demonstrated a normal white cell count with neutrophilia (4000/microl, 90.5% 
      neutrophils), an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 10 mm/h and C-reactive protein 
      value of 9.0mg/dl. Roentgenogram and computed tomographic scan of the chest shows 
      bilateral infiltration and diffuse ground glass opacity, indicating acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but disseminated nodules, indicating miliary 
      tuberculosis, were not found. Blood gas analysis demonstrated severe hypoxemia (PaO2 
      43.2Torr with 6L/ min oxygen). Based on the diagnosis of acute pneumonia and ARDS, 
      intravenous administration of sivelestat sodium hydrate (100 mg/day), and continuous 
      infusion of hydrocortisone (200 mg/day) were started. PaO2/FiO2 ratio improved but 
      X-ray findings showed no improvement and a blood test revealed pancytopenia. Bone 
      marrow biopsy revealed necrotizing epithelioid granuloma and acid-fast bacilli. A 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test detected Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also detected in sputum and urine. Therefore, we 
      diagnosed miliary tuberculosis and transferred the patient to an infectious disease 
      hospital. Miliary tuberculosis complicated with ARDS is relatively rare and the 
      prognosis is extremely poor. Miliary tuberculosis should be kept in mind as a cause 
      of ARDS.

LID - 10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.04.005 [doi]
AB  - The zoonotic characteristic of Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (MAA) represents a 
      veterinary and economic problem in infected pigs. In this study, we analysed 
      cell-mediated immunity six months after experimental infection by measuring 
      interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production and by performing lymphocyte transformation tests 
      after in vitro re-stimulation with the MAA-derived antigen. At the same time, 
      IFN-γ-producing cells were characterised by flow cytometry. In MAA-infected animals, 
      the production of IFN-γ increased in response to the MAA antigen in the blood, 
      spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. Similarly, a positive antigen-driven response was 
      detected by the proliferation assay. In contrast, IFN-γ production and proliferation 
      was undetectable after stimulation with the MAA antigen in uninfected control 
      animals. These results indicate that both methods can be used for the identification 
      of individual MAA-infected pigs. Using flow cytometry, we found that double-positive 
      CD4(+)CD8(+) lymphocytes were the major T lymphocyte subset producing IFN-γ after in 
      vitro re-stimulation.

TI  - The cytokine response to bacille Calmette Guérin vaccination in South India.
PG  - 836-43
AB  - SETTING: Evaluation of immune response after BCG vaccination in a population from 
      South India where BCG vaccination was a failure. OBJECTIVE: To study the 
      cell-mediated immune responses (CMI) in vitro by assessing skin test conversion, 
      lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine patterns before and after BCG vaccination in 
      20 Mantoux negative subjects, and to compare this with that of 20 naturally Mantoux 
      positive subjects. DESIGN: In vitro lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine responses 
      to various mycobacterial antigens were studied in 12 subjects from each group. The 
      cytokines interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 were measured 
      by both reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: All of those who were initially Mantoux 
      negative but one subject converted to positivity following vaccination, confirming 
      that BCG vaccination does cause skin test conversion. However, in vitro 
      proliferative responses to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), purified protein derivative 
      (PPD) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis remained largely unaltered by vaccination. The 
      production of IFN-gamma was significantly higher in PPD-positive individuals 
      compared to the PPD-negative group, and BCG vaccination of the latter did not change 
      the levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that PPD-negative 
      individuals did not produce IFN-gamma even following vaccination and skin test 
      conversion suggests that BCG had little effect in driving the immune response 
      towards a protective Th1 type.

TI  - Anti-Kp 90 IgA antibodies in the diagnosis of active tuberculosis.
PG  - 1253-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) has been difficult 
      historically, yet a great demand persists for a rapid and reliable diagnostic 
      method. Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis anti-Kp 90 IgA antibodies is one of 
      the more novel techniques. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic value of a 
      recently developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test, which detects IgA 
      antibodies against M tuberculosis Kp 90 antigen, and to compare the results with 
      conventional diagnosis and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Serum, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-blood, and body fluid samples were 
      obtained from 51 patients with active TB and 71 control subjects. The clinical 
      diagnosis of TB was supported by a positive culture (n = 6), detection of acid-fast 
      bacilli on smear (n = 35), or both (n = 10). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: IgA 
      antibodies were detected in sera and/or body fluid samples from 82% of patients with 
      TB and 10% of controls. M tuberculosis DNA was detected in body fluid sample of 96% 
      and blood sample of 49% of patients with TB by PCR. None of the blood and 5.6% of 
      the body fluid specimens from controls were PCR-positive. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Kp 90 
      IgA antibodies were detected using ELISA in 78% of serum and 69% of body fluids from 
      patients with TB, therefore, this test is promising for the diagnosis of active TB 
      and appears to be more reliable, particularly for body fluid samples.

TI  - Epidemiology and diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in captive Asian elephants 
      (Elephas maximus).
PG  - 1-16
AB  - The deaths of two Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) in August 1996 led the United 
      States Department of Agriculture to require the testing and treatment of elephants 
      for tuberculosis. From August 1996 to September 1999. Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      infection was confirmed by culture in 12 of 118 elephants in six herds. Eight 
      diagnoses were made antemortem on the basis of isolation of M. tuberculosis by 
      culture of trunk wash samples; the remainder (including the initial two) were 
      diagnosed postmortem. We present the case histories, epidemiologic characteristics, 
      diagnostic test results, and therapeutic plans from these six herds. The intradermal 
      tuberculin test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serology, the blood tuberculosis 
      test, and nucleic acid amplification and culture are compared as methods to diagnose 
      M. tuberculosis infection in elephants.

TI  - Evidence for a rhesus monkey model of asymptomatic tuberculosis.
PG  - 134-45
AB  - Rhesus monkeys (RM) were inoculated intrabronchially with graded doses of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains Erdman and H37Rv in an effort to produce a 
      model of asymptomatic tuberculosis infection. Erdman strain produced active disease 
      within 7-11 weeks regardless of dose. Low doses of H37Rv resulted in asymptomatic 
      infections; high doses produced active disease within 11 weeks. Over a 4-month 
      period of post-inoculation study, MTB culture-filtrate protein (CFP)-stimulated 
      bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BALC) and blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from monkeys 
      with active disease (30 cfu Erdman-inoculated) or asymptomatic infection (200 cfu 
      H37Rv-inoculated) produced similar significant quantities of mRNA encoding for 
      IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha, but insignificant quantities of IL-4 mRNA. Differences were 
      observed in antigen-induced in vitro blastogenic responses and serum 
      anti-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antibody responses in animals with active compared with 
      asymptomatic MTB infections. The results indicate that RM are a good model for the 
      study of asymptomatic tuberculosis infections using low doses of H37Rv.

AB  - A 37-year-old Persian-speaking woman presented with epigastric pain, vomiting and 
      non-specific frontal headache. Examination was unremarkable except for an isolated 
      sixth nerve palsy found a few days after admission. Blood results were normal, as 
      was the chest radiograph and the CT scan of the head. Initial cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF) analysis revealed a significantly elevated protein level with reduced glucose, 
      as well as CSF lymphocytosis. Tuberculosis (TB) meningitis was considered and she 
      was commenced on anti-TB treatment before confirmation of the diagnosis. A full 
      contact tracing was performed with regular follow-up with TB nurses. When she was 
      seen in the clinic a month later, her symptoms had subsided completely.

TI  - Activation of macrophages and interference with CD4+ T-cell stimulation by 
      Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium subspecies 
      avium.
PG  - 62-9
AB  - Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (M. ptb) and M. avium subspecies 
      avium (M. avium) are closely related but exhibit significant differences in their 
      interaction with the host immune system. The macrophage line, J774, was infected 
      with M. ptb and M. avium and analysed for cytokine production and stimulatory 
      capacity towards antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. Under all conditions J774 cells were 
      activated to produce proinflammatory cytokines. No influence on the expression of 
      major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 
      (ICAM-1), B7.1, B7.2 or CD40 was found. However, the antigen-specific stimulatory 
      capacity of J774 cells for a CD4+ T-cell line was significantly inhibited after 
      infection with M. ptb, but not with M. avium. When a T-cell hybridoma expressing a 
      T-cell receptor identical to that of the T-cell line was used, this inhibition was 
      not observed, suggesting that costimulation which is essential for the CD4+ T-cell 
      line is influenced by the pathogenic bacterium M. ptb.

PG  - 116-9
AB  - Tuberculosis miliar is a very rare complication of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) 
      immunotherapy that is associated to high mortality. Thus, early diagnosis and 
      treatment is essential. At present, there is a polymerase chain reaction technique 
      (PCR) which is a rapid diagnostic method with elevated sensitivity. Treatment with 
      tuberculostatic agents should be initiated as soon as possible, the combination of 
      corticosteroids and cycloserine in serious cases being advisable. A case of a 75 
      year old patient with intravesical BCG instillations after a transurethral resection 
      of bladder cancer is presented. He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due 
      to severe acute respiratory failure evolving to acute respiratory distress syndrome 
      (ARDS). Mycobacterium bovis DNA was identified by PCR in blood samples and 
      bronchoaspirate (BAS). He was treated with tuberculostatic agents and 
      corticosteroids, dying due to respiratory failure.

      preceded asymptomatic pulmonary tuberculosis and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 
      (ATL). He visited our hospital with multiple reddish plaques and erythema of 4-12 
      months duration. A skin biopsy revealed non-caseating epithelioid granulomas. 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected by polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR)-hybridization from a skin biopsy specimen and was also isolated from a culture 
      of the skin biopsy sample. The result of chest roentogenography was compatible with 
      pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, the diagnosis of ATL was based upon the 
      presence of atypical lymphocytes with convoluted nuclei in his peripheral blood and 
      a positive anti-ATL antibody reaction. Cases of cutaneous tuberculosis presenting 
      with unusual clinical features may be on the increase, accompanying the spread of 
      tuberculosis in immunosuppressed patients, including those with ATL and acquired 
      immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

PG  - 31-6
AB  - To identify antigens that would improve the accuracy of serological diagnosis of 
      active tuberculosis, we cloned the genes encoding nine potentially immunogenic 
      secreted or surface-associated proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recombinant 
      proteins were reacted with sera from HIV-negative individuals with extrapulmonary 
      tuberculosis (EP-TB) or HIV-positive individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis (TBH). 
      Specific and high level antibody responses were obtained for four recombinant 
      proteins, of which antigen GST-822 was recognized by 60% of EP-TB and 42% of TBH and 
      antigen MBP-506 was recognized by 45% of EP-TB and 61% of TBH. These results suggest 
      that these proteins are strong candidates as subunits in a polyvalent serodiagnostic 
      test.

AB  - Definitive diagnosis of tuberculous pericarditis requires identification of bacilli 
      in pericardial fluid or tissue. Conventional diagnostic methods are time-consuming 
      and have a low sensitivity making bacteriological confirmation of the disease very 
      difficult. Hereby, we report the case of molecular detection of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis in pericardial fluid, bone marrow and peripheral blood from a 
      63-year-old woman with pericardial tuberculosis, using a nested PCR assay specific 
      for IS6110 insertion element of M. tuberculosis complex. The patient had an 
      excellent response to a three-drug combination anti-tuberculous regimen and 1 year 
      later was asymptomatic, without evidence of constrictive pericarditis.

TI  - [Immunogenetic aspects of the course and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis].
PG  - 34-7
AB  - The paper presents the clinical, X-ray, and laboratory characteristics of patients 
      with pulmonary tuberculosis. Both general regularities and differences in the 
      frequency of alleles of the HLA-DQB1* locus have been revealed in the groups of 
      patients with pulmonary tuberculosis as compared with healthy individuals. There are 
      specificities associated with the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis and the variants of 
      the course of infection; thus, allele 05 of the HLA-DQB1* locus is positively 
      associated with the incidence of tuberculosis. Specificity 03 of the HLA-DQB1* locus 
      has been ascertained to be associated with the poor course of the disease. The most 
      pronounced immunological changes have been observed in patients with the poor course 
      of the disease, who are the carriers of specificity 05 of the HLA-DQB1* locus. The 
      totality of immunological parameters and the data of genetic studies provide a basis 
      for using the selective immunomodulator rIL-2 (roncoleukin) in the most seriously 
      ill patients who are carriers of specificity 05.

TI  - [A case of intracranial tuberculoma early diagnosed by open brain biopsy].
PG  - 387-90
AB  - A 31-year-old man suffered from cough, sputum, slight fever, and loss of 
      consciousness. He was tentatively diagnosed as epilepsy, and was transferred to our 
      hospital. Brain CT demonstrated multiple intracranial lesions, which were 
      homogeneously enhanced. Chest X-ray revealed retiform shadow in the right middle 
      lung field. Pulmonary tuberculosis and intracranial tuberculomas were suspected and 
      bacterial cultures, PCR, smear examination of sputum, blood, CSF, gastric juice, and 
      urine were repeated. But no evidence of tuberculosis was obtained. Follow-up CT 
      after 5 days of admission showed exacerbation of intracranial lesions. Finally, the 
      open brain biopsy was carefully done from the right occipital lesion. The 
      histological examination disclosed a typical pathology of tuberculoma and PCR also 
      turned out to be positive from the brain tissue. We diagnosed him as intracranial 
      tuberculoma and anti-tuberculous drugs(isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide) were 
      administered. After 30 days under the medication, brain CT demonstrated a transient 
      expansion of the intracranial lesions. While the same therapy was sustained, 
      intracranial lesions gradually decreased and he discharged after 60 days of 
      admission. Brain CT is known as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of intracranial 
      tuberculoma. Its sensitivity is almost 100%, but some clinical reports have 
      described that its specificity is not always so high(20-71%) as expected. In 
      addition, it should be recognized that intracranial tuberculoma might show 
      'paradoxical expansion'. It is a phenomenon, which shows a paradoxical worsening in 
      clinical aspect despite of the appropriate therapy. In such a progressing case as 
      ours, it is desirable to make a definite diagnosis before anti-tuberculous drug is 
      started. Therefore, it is recommended in possible cases to even consider the open 
      brain biopsy from the early period when intracranial tuberculoma is highly 
      suspected.

TI  - Pulmonary tuberculosis accompanied by a transient increase in serum carcinoembryonic 
      antigen level with tuberculous empyema drainage.
PG  - 1795-8
AB  - We present a case of pleural effusion with encapsulation that was observed in the 
      right thorax of a patient. PCR analysis of the patient's pleural effusion showed 
      positivity for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. After six months, his chest CT showed the 
      development of niveau and pulmonary consolidation. We definitively diagnosed him as 
      having chronic pulmonary tuberculosis with tuberculous empyema drainage. At the time 
      of his hospital admission, his serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was 
      elevated. After we started treatment using antituberculosis drugs, the infiltration 
      shadow in his lung fields disappeared, and the serum CEA level decreased. The 
      results suggest that the serum CEA level reflects the extent of the development of 
      pulmonary tuberculosis lesions.

TI  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis-activated dendritic cells induce protective immunity in 
      mice.
PG  - 473-80
AB  - Activated dendritic cells are critically important in the priming of T-cell 
      responses. In this report we show that the infection of a conditionally immortalized 
      dendritic cell line (tsDC) with Mycobacterium tuberculosis resulted in the 
      up-regulation of B7-1 and B7-2 co-stimulatory molecules and the induction of several 
      inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, 
      -1beta and -12. In addition, we show that these activated dendritic cells were 
      capable of eliciting antigen-specific T-cell responses and potent anti-mycobacterial 
      protective immunity in a murine model of experimental tuberculosis infection.

PG  - 49-51
AB  - A comprehensive study was conducted to determine the activity of tuberculous 
      infection in 115 patients who formed 3 groups: 1) patients with primary forms of 
      tuberculosis; 2) those who were infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT); and 
      3) those who were infected with bronchopulmonary diseases. The detection of MBT DNA 
      in the blood by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a highly sensitive four-primed 
      diagnostic kit established that 80 patients with tuberculosis had positive results 
      and their decrease as the patient had a course of tuberculostatic therapy. The fact 
      that a third of patients from Groups 2 and 3 had highly positive results of PCR 
      required that a preventive course of double therapy be used for 3 to 6 months.

TI  - Interleukin-12 receptor beta1 deficiency in a patient with abdominal tuberculosis.
PG  - 231-6
AB  - Two siblings with interleukin-12 receptor beta1 (IL-12Rbeta1) deficiency but 
      different clinical phenotypes were studied. Both are homozygous for an IL12RB1 
      missense mutation that prevents receptor expression and abolishes cellular responses 
      to IL-12. Transfection of the patients' T cells with wild-type IL12RB1 restored 
      IL-12Rbeta1 expression and function. One patient had the expected phenotype of 
      disseminated bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) infection in early childhood, whereas the 
      other did not develop BCG infection, despite 3 inoculations with live BCG. Abdominal 
      tuberculosis was diagnosed in this second patient at age 18 years. To date, neither 
      of them has had clinical disease caused by environmental mycobacteria. These 
      observations show unexpected interfamilial and intrafamilial heterogeneity of the 
      clinical phenotype associated with IL-12Rbeta1 deficiency. The patients may be 
      resistant to BCG but remain vulnerable to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A diagnosis of 
      IL-12Rbeta1 deficiency should therefore be considered in selected patients with 
      severe tuberculosis, despite their resistance to BCG and a lack of atypical 
      mycobacteriosis.

TI  - [The pathomorphism and diagnosis of tuberculosis of intrathoracic lymph nodes in 
      children].
PG  - 33-6
AB  - In the past decade, the leading form of specific lesion in children is tuberculosis 
      of intrathoracic lymph nodes, whose proportion in the pattern of clinical forms is 
      as high as 85.7%. The period of 1990 to 2002 showed a 3-fold increase in the 
      detection of bilateral lesion involving more than 3 groups of lymph nodes; the 
      specific processes were complicated by 3.5 times more frequently. The proportion of 
      generalized forms of primary tuberculosis increased from 5 to 15%. Inclusion of 
      mediastinal computed tomography into a package of studies significantly evaluates 
      the magnitude of enlargement of lymph nodes. The polymerase chain reaction test for 
      MBT DNA in the diagnosis of tuberculosis of intrathoracic lymph nodes in the absence 
      of bacterial isolation yields a positive result in 73.3% of the children, which is 
      an additional tool in the comprehensive study, which verifies the activity of a 
      tuberculous process.

TI  - Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis after acute bacterial prostatitis: a case report.
PG  - 402-4; discussion 405
AB  - A case of pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis after acute bacterial prostatitis in a 
      78-year-old man is reported. The rarity and subtle clinical presentation of this 
      condition, and the delayed appearance of radiologic signs of progression to 
      destructive osteomyelitis, contributed to a significant delay in diagnosis. An 
      arterial blood culture positive for bacterial growth during the episode of acute 
      prostatitis suggested that bacteremia might result from hematogenous spread of the 
      infection to the vertebral column via the venous system. Since intensive 
      antimicrobial therapy proved ineffective, debridement of the first and second lumbar 
      vertebral bodies, and anterior spinal fusion from the twelfth thoracic to the third 
      lumbar vertebrae were performed. The patient's high fever and severe lumbago 
      subsided immediately after the surgery. The possibility of development to pyogenic 
      vertebral osteomyelitis should be kept in mind when treating a serious genitourinary 
      tract infection.

AB  - This case report describes a 61-year-old rheumatoid arthritis patient with an 
      atypical clinical presentation of a sore throat. Because of rheumatoid arthritis 
      refractory to conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy, 
      anti-TNFalpha was felt to be indicated, and a screening for tuberculosis was carried 
      out. As the screening for tuberculosis (PPD) was positive, isoniazid was prescribed 
      prophylactically for six months. After eight months of anti-TNFalpha (adalimumab) 
      treatment, he developed tonsillar enlargement and nodular pulmonary lesions. 
      Histopathological and microbial investigations established the diagnosis of 
      tonsillar tuberculosis.

AB  - A 21-year-old woman suffering from abdominal pain and a fever of 39 degrees C was 
      hospitalized. Ultrasonography and computed tomographic scan showed a large amount of 
      ascites and one hepatic node. The serum CA 125 level was elevated. Protein Chain 
      Reaction (PCR) searching tuberculosis antigen in ascitic fluid was normal. A 
      diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis was supposed and an exploratory laparoscopic 
      procedure performed. Peroperative observation of the ascites, with multiple sites of 
      adhesion, and pathological examination of the hepatic nodule and peritoneum 
      confirmed initial diagnosis. Antituberculous treatment was given for one year. A 
      second laparoscopic procedure was performed and found no disease remaining.

TI  - Evaluation of a commercially available serologic assay for antibodies against 
      tuberculosis-associated glycolipid antigen.
PG  - 832-6
AB  - A commercially available enzyme immunoassay developed to detect antibodies to a 
      tuberculosis-associated glycolipid antigen was evaluated for serologic diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis. This was a multicenter study comparing the assay with other methods in 
      78 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and in 54 controls with 
      non-tuberculous lung diseases. Sensitivities were highest for sputum culture 
      (91.0%), followed by immunoassay (79.5%), nucleic acid amplification (77.3%), and 
      finally acid-fast staining of sputum smear (60.3%). Immunoassay and amplification, 
      both rapid methods, had similarly high sensitivity in smear-positive subjects (89.4 
      and 88.9%, respectively); in smear-negative subjects these two techniques showed low 
      sensitivity (64.5 and 60.0%, respectively). Concordance between the two methods was 
      relatively low (72.0%). With regard to specificity, seven out of ten patients with 
      old tuberculosis had positive result by immunoassay (30% specificity). In the 
      control group, 10 out of 54 patients had positive immunoassay result (72.2% 
      specificity), with notably limited specificity in the elderly. The tuberculous 
      glycolipid assay is a rapid method sufficiently sensitive for detection of 
      tuberculosis infection, even in smear-negative patients.

PG  - 521-5
AB  - A 57-year-old man was admitted because of headache, nausea, and fever up (38 degrees 
      C). He showed nuchal rigidity slightly. CSF analysis showed 833 white blood cells 
      (WBC) (80% monocyte), protein value of 68 mg/dl, glucose level of 36 mg/dl and ADA 
      level of 11.8 IU/l. Brain pre-contrast CT indicated high density area in right 
      parietal lobe, and it showed slightly homogeneously enhancement with contrast 
      medium. MRI on T2 WI demonstrated hypointense lesion with bright central core in 
      right parietal lobe. The lesion showed isointense on T1WI, and indicated homogeneous 
      enhancement with Gd-DTPA. He was sent to our hospital after one week. With only 
      antibiotics the symptoms were relieved and the CSF findings improved during the 
      previous hospital. However, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) DNA was 
      detected in CSF by PCR amplification, and he recovered completely with 
      anti-tuberculous treatment. This case was interesting to reveal atypical features of 
      spontaneous recovery. Since Shankar's study using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      for detection of M. tuberculosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the PCR assay have 
      been recognized to be a rapid method for diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM). 
      But there are problems of PCR sensitivity when dealing with CSF samples containing 
      small amount of M. tuberculosis DNA. Comparing direct PCR with nested PCR, we 
      studied on the evaluation of PCR for diagnosis of TBM. In this study the nested PCR 
      was positive in all CSF specimens from 4 patients with TBM, but we could not detect 
      M. tuberculosis DNA by only the direct PCR. Nested PCR amplification improved the 
      sensitivity and specificity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - [A case of tuberculous pyometrium concurrent with tuberculous pleurisy].
PG  - 117-20
AB  - An 84-year-old woman began to have low fever below 38 degrees C with slight 
      lassitude from June 19, 2002. Despite oral administration of Clarithromycin for 3 
      days, the fever did not subside and the lassitude increased, so she was admitted to 
      our department. While inflammatory findings were noticed, the cause was not 
      identified by blood and imaging examinations (thoracoabdominal CT, etc.). Although 
      her tuberculin reaction was positive, symptoms indicative of pulmonary tuberculosis 
      were absent. Administration of Cefotiam and Imipenem Cilastatin sodium was 
      ineffective. Pyometra was diagnosed. After drainage, the uterine cavity was washed 
      every day. On the basis of culture of fluid retained a few colonies of Gram-negative 
      bacteria were isolated, but were not identified, Cefpirome was administered, 
      whereupon the fever subsided gradually, but mild inflammatory findings remained. 
      Even after discharge on July 24, the retention increased, so drainage and washing 
      were done repeatedly. However, mild inflammatory findings persisted. She began to 
      have a fever from September 17 and was readmitted. After admission, administration 
      of Flomoxef sodium was started, but no improvement was seen. A small amount of 
      hydrothorax appeared on the left. Thoracocentesis yielded a bloody, slightly turbid 
      exudative. Acid-fast staining and Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific PCR of pleural 
      effusion were negative, but adenosindeaminase was 87.4 U/l. Therefore, a diagnosis 
      of tuberculous pleurisy was made. DNA/PCR of tubercle bacilli in the fluid retained 
      in the uterus was positive, and re-retention was prevented by administration of 
      anti-tuberculosis drugs. These findings suggest a strong possibility of tubercle 
      bacillus having been the causative bacteria. Particularly in the case of the 
      elderly, it appears important that pyometra be included in differential diagnosis as 
      the cause of fever even without gynecological symptoms and that tubercle bacillus be 
      considered the causative bacterium.

TI  - Analysis of T cells recruited during delayed-type hypersensitivity to purified 
      protein derivative (PPD) versus challenge with tuberculosis infection.
PG  - 69-75
AB  - The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) to purified protein derivative (PPD) test 
      has been used to infer about protective immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 
      to diagnose tuberculosis. We showed that in memory tuberculosis-immune mice both DTH 
      to PPD and resistance to M. tuberculosis could be effectively elicited in the 
      footpad and both reactions led to the accumulation of reactive T cells in the 
      regional lymph nodes with a CD4+ phenotype and characterized by the secretion of 
      high levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and no IL-4. By 
      adoptive transfer into nude mice of highly purified CD4+ T cells harvested during 
      the recall of protective immunity it was confirmed that this population mediated 
      both manifestations. However, the specificity of the T cells recruited during these 
      processes were found to differ markedly; T cells involved in protection to a 
      challenge with live tuberculosis bacilli recognized predominantly low-mass culture 
      filtrate antigens below 15 000 MW, while cells recruited during DTH to PPD were 
      directed to molecular mass fractions between 15 000 and 31 000. Using single 
      purified antigens we showed that the latter cells recognized the secreted 
      mycobacterial protein Ag85B and the heat-shock proteins, DnaK and GroEL. Protective 
      T cells, in contrast, were characterized by a very high frequency of T cells 
      directed to the ESAT-6 peptide 1-20.

TI  - Polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of infectious diseases.
PG  - 89-97
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been utilized and demonstrated to be useful 
      for detecting minute amounts of a wide variety of infectious agents. In such 
      studies, one must keep in mind that the most appropriate conditions for 
      amplification vary with organisms of interest. In this study, PCR was used as a 
      rapid and sensitive method for detecting infectious agents for which three assay 
      systems were devised comprising the method for the amplification of human T cell 
      leukemia virus type I, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The 
      possibility of vertical transmission of human T cell leukemia virus type I through 
      cord blood was demonstrated using cord blood mononuclear cells from carrier mothers 
      of this virus. In the study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, PCR was shown to be 
      efficient, particularly in detecting this organism in extrapulmonary cases. Evidence 
      of direct invasion into the central nervous system by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and the 
      concomitant occurrence of mycoplasmaemia in the mycoplasmal central nervous system 
      involvement was obtained using PCR. These results validated the potential of PCR in 
      the clinical research of infectious diseases.

      Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
PG  - 1016-22
AB  - A gene amplification method of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by the polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) has been devised. A primer pair used in this study is 
      5'GTTGCCGTGGCGG TATCGG3' and 5'GCGACATTACGGGGCAGGTGG3', which brackets a 152-base 
      region encoding the 65KD antigen, and a specific probe is 5'TTTGGGGTCATCTTTGGAGCG3'. 
      The procedure could be completed within 2 days. The specificity and the sensitivity 
      of the PCR for M. tuberculosis complex in identifying M. tuberculosis complex did 
      not conflict with the conventional methods at all. Using this method, we could 
      diagnose three cases of the disease, which had been very difficult to diagnose by 
      the conventional methods, by detecting the DNA from the blood, liver biopsy 
      specimen, lung aspirate, and pleural effusion.

TI  - [The clinical evaluation of MTD false-positive & false-negative results].
PG  - 611-6
AB  - The usefulness of MTD (Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test) for a rapid 
      diagnosis of tuberculosis was evaluated. A total of 400 clinical samples obtained 
      from July, 1995 to June, 1997 were tested by MTD, direct microscopy and culture. The 
      results of MTD and smear/culture were coincident in 387 out of 400 samples. Eight 
      samples (2%) were MTD false-positive (i.e. they were MTD positive but smear and 
      culture negative), and 5 (1.25%) were MTD false-negative (i.e. MTD negative but 
      smear and/or culture positive). Despite a careful review of the clinical data of 
      those patients whose samples showed discrepant results, the reasons of discrepancy 
      were not clear in 2 (0.5%) of the 8 false positives and 3 (0.75%) of the 5 false 
      negatives. In the other cases, the MTD false positives may be accounted for the 
      presence of previous M. tuberculosis infection, the influence of anti-tuberculous 
      medication and so on, and the MTD false negatives are most likely due to the 
      presence of inhibitors (blood, for example) or to the small number of organisms in 
      the specimens. It can be concluded that adequate samples should be obtained, and 
      that MTD should be repeated in case of discrepant results.

TI  - [A case of tuberculosis pleuritis with high serum soluble IL-2 receptor].
PG  - 191-4
AB  - A 56-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of bilateral pleural 
      effusion. Computed tomography revealed solitary mediastinal lymphadenopathy, 
      splenomegaly and a small amount of ascites. No lung parenchymal lesion was seen. 
      Although lymphocyte predominance without atypia and a high adenocine deaminase 
      concentration in the pleural fluid were compatible with tuberculous pleurisy, no 
      mycobacteria could be detected either with Ziehl-Nielsen stain or with PCR. Because 
      the serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2 R) level was unexpectedly high (> 
      8,000 U/ml), and a level not previously reported in benign diseases, we performed 
      thoracoscopy- and mediastinoscopy-assisted biopsies, both of which eventually 
      confirmed the diagnosis of tuberculosis. After a 4-drug anti-tuberculous regimen was 
      initiated, pleural effusion and ascites subsided, with a marked decrease in the 
      sIL-2R level. This case indicates that in tuberculous pleurisy, serum sIL-2R can 
      rise to a level suggestive of hematological malignancies, it and also illustrates 
      the validity of thoracoscopy-assisted pleural biopsy in such situations.

AB  - We present a patient diagnosed as having tuberculous lymphadenitis after lymph node 
      biopsy and referred for tuberculous therapy. On review, because of recent cat

      Bartonella henselae were negative. However, the diagnosis of CSD was confirmed, and 
      tuberculosis excluded, by polymerase chain reaction techniques. This case serves as 
      a reminder that CSD may mimic tuberculosis histologically and that sensitive 
      molecular diagnostic tests are available.

TI  - Severe lymphopenia in tuberculosis. A mere coincidence or a significant association?
PG  - 65-7
AB  - A variety of infectious agents can cause secondary immunodeficient states. We herein 
      present a one-year-old patient, admitted to the hospital with severe lymphopenia, 
      who was subsequently diagnosed as tuberculosis. After the antituberculosis (anti TB) 
      therapy was started, the clinical condition and the immunologic findings of the 
      patient improved. We have thus concluded that the transient lymphopenia of the 
      patient was due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We suggest that immunodeficiency 
      should be investigated more often in children with tuberculosis and that further 
      studies will shed light on the pathogenesis of this aspect of the disease.

PG  - 29-32
AB  - Two polymerase chain reaction-based test systems were used to identify Mycobacteria 
      tuberculosis by using a clinical material for practical health purposes. The former 
      test system strictly specifically enables M. tuberculosis to be detected. The latter 
      also allows one to differentiate a BCG vaccine strain from the M. tuberculosis. The 
      test systems were tested by using 11 clinical sputum samples, three of them were 
      taken from patients with fibrocavernous tuberculosis, two from those with focal 
      tuberculosis and one from that with infiltrative one, 5 from those with non-specific 
      pulmonary diseases (chronic bronchitis and asthma). In addition, one serum sample 
      from a patient with fibrocavernous tuberculosis was examined. All tests obtained 
      from patients with tuberculosis were positive, whereas those from patients with 
      non-specific pulmonary diseases were negative. This suggests that differentiation of 
      BCG vaccine strain from M. tuberculosis can be used both in model experiments and in 
      the study of clinical material lysates.

PG  - 621-5
AB  - A 75-year-old female was admitted to our hospital for further examination of the 
      cause of blood-stained sputum and abnormal shadow on chest radiogram which had 
      developed immediately after an injury of right chest wall. The bacteriological 
      examination of sputum on admission revealed negative Gaffky score, but positive PCR, 
      and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated by culture. Her symptoms and chest 
      radiogram were improved by the administration of isoniazid, ethambutol and 
      rifampicin. Although development of pulmonary tuberculosis induced by chest wall 
      injury is rare, in case of the aged persons such possibility should be considered. 
      PCR may be useful for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis, even in such case.

TI  - Increased replication of HIV-1 at sites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: 
      potential mechanisms of viral activation.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) enhances HIV-1 replication and the progression to AIDS in dually 
      infected patients. We employed pleural TB as a model to understand the interaction 
      of the host with HIV-1 during active TB, at sites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      (MTB) infection. HIV-1 replication was enhanced both in the cellular (pleural 
      compared with blood mononuclear cells) and acellular (pleural fluid compared with 
      plasma) compartments of the pleural space. Several potential mechanisms for 
      expansion of HIV-1 in situ were found, including augmentation in expression of tumor 
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and the HIV-1 noninhibitory beta-chemokine (MCP-1), low 
      presence of HIV-1 inhibitory beta-chemokines (MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and RANTES 
      [regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted]), and upregulation in 
      expression of the HIV-1 coreceptor, CCR5, by pleural fluid mononuclear cells. Thus, 
      at sites of MTB infection, conditions are propitious both for transcriptional 
      activation of HIV-1 in latently infected mononuclear cells, and facilitation of 
      viral infection of newly recruited cells. These mechanisms may contribute to 
      enhanced viral burden and dissemination during TB infection.

TI  - [Determination of the cytokine gene polymorphism and genetic susceptibility in 
      tuberculosis patients].
PG  - 250-64
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a complicated disease in which biological, socioeconomical and 
      environmental factors play role. Since only 10% of the individuals infected with 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis develop active disease, it has been suggested that host 
      genetic factors may influence the risk for the development of TB. In this study, we 
      aimed to investigate the presence and role of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 
      gene regions responsible for cytokine production, since these factors are considered 
      to be associated with susceptibility or resistance to disease development. Single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms were investigated by Amplification Refractory Mutational 
      System (ARMS) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and PCR-Restriction Fragment Length 
      Polymorphism (RFLP) methods. The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms were 
      analyzed in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) gene promoter -308 G>A (rs1800629) 
      region, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) gene +874 T>A (rs61923114) region, interleukin 
      (IL)-12B p40 gene 1188 A>C (rs3212227) region, IL-10 gene promoter -1082 G>A 
      (rs1800896) region and IL-4 gene promoter -590 C>T (rs2243250) region. A total of 84 
      patients (71 male, 13 female; mean age: 32.57 ± 15.94 years) whose clinical samples 
      yielded M.tuberculosis complex growth, and 110 healthy blood donors (93 male, 17 
      female; mean age: 29.40 ± 11.56 years) as control group were included in this study. 
      Of the patients, 76 (90.5%) were diagnosed as pulmonary and 8 (9.5%) as 
      extrapulmonary TB. While 79 (94.1%) patients were newly diagnosed as TB, 5 (5.9%) 
      patients had a TB history (relapsed TB). It was detected that acid-fast bacilli 
      (AFB) were positive in 58 (69%) patients. According to the single nucleotide 
      polymorphism results, gene frequencies could not be compared for TNF-a gene promoter 
      -308 G>A region since healthy controls were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium while the 
      patients were not. There were no statistically significant differences in allele and 
      genotype distribution between the patients and healthy controls in IFN-γ gene +874 
      T>A region, IL-12B p40 gene 1188 A>C region, IL-10 gene promoter -1082 G>A region 
      and IL-4 gene promoter -590 C>T region (p> 0.05). There were also no statistically 
      significant differences between AFB positive (n= 58) and negative (n= 26) patients, 
      and AFB positive (n= 56) and negative (n= 20) pulmonary TB patients (p> 0.05). In 
      conclusion, no statistically significant differences were found associated with the 
      susceptibility or resistance to TB with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene 
      regions responsible for cytokine production in the study population. Only some of 
      the single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene regions responsible for cytokine 
      release were investigated in our study. Therefore further detailed studies to 
      investigate the polymorphisms in the genes that control the cytokine release and 
      receptors specific for these cytokines, should be conducted. Although this study was 
      performed in a relatively small sized population, these findings might provide a 
      significant contribution to the epidemiologic data about the molecular immunology of 
      TB in Turkey.

TI  - Control of T cell antigen reactivity via programmed TCR downregulation.
PG  - 379-86
LID - 10.1038/ni.3386 [doi]
AB  - The T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is unique in that its affinity for ligand is 
      unknown before encounter and can vary by orders of magnitude. How the immune system 
      regulates individual T cells that display very different reactivity to antigen 
      remains unclear. Here we found that activated CD4(+) T cells, at the peak of clonal 
      expansion, persistently downregulated their TCR expression in proportion to the 
      strength of the initial antigen recognition. This programmed response increased the 
      threshold for cytokine production and recall proliferation in a clone-specific 
      manner and ultimately excluded clones with the highest antigen reactivity. Thus, 
      programmed downregulation of TCR expression represents a negative feedback mechanism 
      for constraining T cell effector function with a suitable time delay to thereby 
      allow pathogen control while avoiding excess inflammatory damage.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the interaction between manLAM and DC-SIGN 
      influencing DCs maturation and downstream immune response using small interfering 
      RNA-expressing lentiviral vectors to specifically knockdown DC-SIGN. Our data 
      indicated that DC-SIGN knockdown alone in DCs did not affect the maturation or the 
      immunological function of lipopolysacharide (LPS)-activated DCs. Surface molecules 
      were dramatically down-regulated in DCs primed with manLAM but not in mock control 
      DCs (P<0.05). Meanwhile, manLAM enhanced the production of the immunosuppressive 
      cytokine IL-10 in DCs (P<0.05). The level of IFN-γ was significantly down-regulated 
      in the supernatants of naive T cells after co-cultured with DCs primed with manLAM 
      (P<0.05). We demonstrated that DCs primed with manLAM may partially impair 
      maturation phenotypes and immune response in LPS-activated DCs. However, the 
      alterations of DCs function and downstream immune response caused by manLAM were 
      reversed by the knockdown of DC-SIGN.

PG  - 2219-24
AB  - A sensitive assay for Leptospira spp., the causative agent of leptospirosis, was 
      developed on the basis of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A 331-bp sequence 
      from the Leptospira interrogans serovar canicola rrs (16S) gene was amplified, and 
      the PCR products were analyzed by DNA-DNA hybridization by using a 289-bp fragment 
      internal to the amplified DNA. Specific PCR products also were obtained with DNA 
      from the closely related nonpathogenic Leptospira biflexa but not with DNA from 
      other spirochetes, such as Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia hermsii, Treponema 
      denticola, Treponema pallidum, Spirochaeta aurantia, or more distant organisms such 
      as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Proteus 
      mirabilis. The assay was able to detect as few as 10 bacteria. Leptospira DNA was 
      detected in urine from experimentally infected mice. In addition, the test was found 
      to be suitable for diagnosing leptospirosis in humans. Cerebrospinal fluid and urine 
      from patients with leptospirosis were positive, whereas samples from control 
      uninfected patients were negative.

AB  - During chronic inflammatory disorders, a persistent natural killer (NK) cell 
      derangement is observed. While increased cell turnover is expected, little is known 
      about whether and how NK-cell homeostatic balance is maintained. Here, flow 
      cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in chronic inflammatory 
      disorders, both infectious and non-infectious, reveals the presence of a 
      CD34(+)CD226(DNAM-1)(bright)CXCR4(+) cell population displaying transcriptional 
      signatures typical of common lymphocyte precursors and giving rise to NK-cell 
      progenies with high expression of activating receptors and mature function and even 
      to α/β T lymphocytes. CD34(+)CD226(bright)CXCR4(+) cells reside in bone marrow, 
      hardly circulate in healthy donors and are absent in cord blood. Their proportion 
      correlates with the degree of inflammation, reflecting lymphoid cell 
      turnover/reconstitution during chronic inflammation. These findings provide insight 
      on intermediate stages of NK-cell development, a view of emergency recruitment of 
      cell precursors, and upgrade our understanding and monitoring of chronic 
      inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Dysregulated circRNAs in plasma from active tuberculosis patients.
PG  - 4076-4084
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.13684 [doi]
AB  - Endogenous circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been reported in various diseases. However, 
      their role in active TB remains unknown. The study was aimed to determine plasma 
      circRNA expression profile to characterize potential biomarker and improve our 
      understanding of active TB pathogenesis. CircRNA expression profiles were screened 
      by circRNA microarrays in active TB plasma samples. Dysregulated circRNAs were then 
      verified by qRT-PCR. CircRNA targets were predicted based on analysis of 
      circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction. GO and KEGG pathway analyses were used to predict 
      the function of circRNA. ROC curve was calculated to evaluate diagnostic value for 
      active TB. A total of 75 circRNAs were significantly dysregulated in active TB 
      plasma. By further validation, hsa_circRNA_103571 exhibited significant decrease in 
      active TB patients and showed potential interaction with active TB-related miRNAs 
      such as miR-29a and miR-16. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that hsa_circRNA_103571 
      was primarily involved in ras signalling pathway, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, 
      T- and B-cell receptor signalling pathway. ROC curve analysis suggested that 
      hsa_circRNA_103571 had significant value for active TB diagnosis. Circulating 
      circRNA dysregulation may play a role in active TB pathogenesis. Hsa_circRNA_103571 
      may be served as a potential biomarker for active TB diagnosis, and 
      hsa_circRNA_103571-miRNA-mRNA interaction may provide some novel mechanism for 
      active TB.

TI  - [Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis in a HIV negative miliary tuberculosis-suspected 
      patient].
PG  - 519-24
AB  - Cryptococcosis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans has a wide range of clinical 
      presentations, varying from asymptomatic colonization of the respiratory airways to 
      the dissemination of infection into different parts of body. It is more common among 
      immunosupressed patients such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive ones. 
      In this report we present a case with C. neoformans meningitis and miliary pulmonary 
      infiltrates suggesting pulmonary tuberculosis without HIV infection. A-70-years-old 
      male was admitted to the hospital with mental confusion, 3-weeks history of 
      headache, weight loss, dry cough and fatigue. Physical examination was normal except 
      neck stiffness. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white cell count was 120/mm3 (80% 
      polimorphonuclear cells). Gram staining of CSF revealed poorly stained gram-positive 
      yeast cells. Empirical therapy with lipozomal amphotericin B, ceftriaxone and 
      ampicillin combination was started. When C. neoformans growth was detected on CSF 
      culture, ceftriaxone and ampicillin were discontinued. Patient became conscious at 
      24th hour of the treatment. Peripheric blood flow-cytometric analysis revealed a 
      significant decrease in absolute CD4+ T lymphocytes, and in CD8+28+ T lymphocytes in 
      addition a significant increase in natural killer cell ratio. Blood immunoglobulin 
      and complement levels were found normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and 
      computerized tomogralphy (CT) of the abdomen were normal, however, chest CT revealed 
      multiple parenchymal millimetric nodular infiltrations on both sides and minimal 
      fibrotic alterations. Acid-fast staining of CSF, tuberculosis culture, tuberculosis 
      PCR results and repeated HIV serology were found negative. Despite the lack of 
      microbiological confirmation, empirical antituberculosis treatment was also started 
      with the suspicion of miliary tuberculosis as the patient had a symptom of long-term 
      dry cough, miliary infiltrations on chest CT, anergic tuberculin skin test and a 
      history of pulmonary tuberculosis in childhood. After two weeks, amphotericin B was 
      changed to oral fluconazole which was continued for an additional eight weeks. 
      Antituberculosis therapy was given for nine months. Control chest CT taken after 
      four months of antituberculosis therapy revealed improvement of the lesions. This 
      presentation emphasizes the fact that cryptococcal infections may develop in HIV 
      negative patients, even together with tuberculosis in certain cases and radiological 
      findings of the two infections may be confusing when both of them invade the lungs.

TI  - Impact of the Mycobaterium africanum West Africa 2 Lineage on TB Diagnostics in West 
      Africa: Decreased Sensitivity of Rapid Identification Tests in The Gambia.
PG  - e0004801
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0004801 [doi]
LID - e0004801
AB  - BACKGROUND: MPT64 rapid speciation tests are increasingly being used in diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis (TB). Mycobacterium africanum West Africa 2 (Maf 2) remains an 
      important cause of TB in West Africa and causes one third of disease in The Gambia. 
      Since the introduction of MPT64 antigen tests, a higher than expected rate of 
      suspected non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) was seen among AFB smear positive TB 
      suspects, which led us to prospectively assess sensitivity of the MPT64 antigen test 
      in our setting. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the abundance of mRNA 
      encoded by the mpt64 gene in sputa of patients with untreated pulmonary TB caused by 
      Maf 2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Subsequently, prospectively collected 
      sputum samples from presumptive TB patients were inoculated in the BACTEC MGIT 960 
      System. One hundred and seventy-three acid fast bacilli (AFB)-positive and blood 
      agar negative MGIT cultures were included in the study. Cultures were tested on the 
      day of MGIT positivity with the BD MGIT TBc Identification Test. A random set of 
      positives and all negatives were additionally tested with the SD Bioline Ag MPT64 
      Rapid. MPT64 negative cultures were further incubated at 37°C and retested until 
      positive. Bacteria were spoligotyped and assigned to different lineages. Maf 2 
      isolates were 2.52-fold less likely to produce a positive test result and 
      sensitivity ranged from 78.4% to 84.3% at the beginning and end of the recommended 
      10 day testing window, respectively. There was no significant difference between the 
      tests. We further showed that the decreased rapid test sensitivity was attributable 
      to variations in mycobacterial growth behavior and the smear grades of the patient. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In areas where Maf 2 is endemic MPT64 tests should be 
      cautiously used and MPT64 negative results confirmed by a second technique, such as 
      nucleic acid amplification tests, to avoid their misclassification as NTMs.

TI  - [Tuberculosis of the pancreas in a HIV-seropositive patient].
PG  - 1167-9
AB  - A 34-year-old man from Nigeria who had resided permanently in the Netherlands for 
      five years had experienced fever, upper abdominal pain and weight loss for several 
      months. He did not give the impression of being ill. A CT scan gave cause to suspect 
      pancreatitis. An HIV test gave a positive result. Puncture of the accumulated fluid 
      around the pancreas led to the diagnosis 'tuberculosis' (infection by Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis). Once the patient had made a good recovery with antituberculosis 
      therapy, antiretroviral therapy was initiated, whereupon the number of CD4+ cells in 
      the blood increased. Extrapulmonal tuberculosis is not unusual in HIV seropositive 
      patients from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. However, in such 
      patients isolated tuberculosis of the pancreas is unusual and has not previously 
      been described in the Netherlands. The diagnosis can be established following a CT 
      guided puncture; tuberculosis is instantly suspected if the Ziehl-Neelsen stains are 
      positive and the diagnosis can then be confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) analysis and by culturing. Anti-retroviral therapy is withheld until response 
      to anti-tuberculosis treatment is satisfactory.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is the most common cause of death in people living 
      with HIV (PLHIV), yet TB often goes undiagnosed since many patients are not able to 
      produce a sputum specimen, and traditional diagnostics are costly or unavailable. A 
      novel, rapid lateral flow assay, Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM (SILVAMP-LAM), detects the 
      presence of TB lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in urine, and is substantially more sensitive 
      for diagnosing TB in PLHIV than an earlier LAM assay (Alere Determine TB LAM lateral 
      flow assay [LF-LAM]). Here, we present an individual participant data meta-analysis 
      of the diagnostic accuracy of SILVAMP-LAM in adult PLHIV, including both published 
      and unpublished data. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult PLHIV (≥18 years) were assessed in 
      5 prospective cohort studies in South Africa (3 cohorts), Vietnam, and Ghana, 
      carried out during 2012 to 2017. Of the 1,595 PLHIV who met eligibility criteria, 
      the majority (61%) were inpatients, median age was 37 years (IQR 30-43), 43% had a 
      CD4 count ≤ 100 cells/μl, and 35% were receiving antiretroviral therapy. Most 
      participants (94%) had a positive WHO symptom screen for TB on enrollment, and 45% 
      were diagnosed with microbiologically confirmed TB, using mycobacterial culture or 
      Xpert MTB/RIF testing of sputum, urine, or blood. Previously published data from 
      inpatients were combined with unpublished data from outpatients. Biobanked urine 
      samples were tested, using blinded double reading, with SILVAMP-LAM and LF-LAM. 
      Applying a microbiological reference standard for assessment of sensitivity, the 
      overall sensitivity for TB detection was 70.7% (95% CI 59.0%-80.8%) for SILVAMP-LAM 
      compared to 34.9% (95% CI 19.5%-50.9%) for LF-LAM. Using a composite reference 
      standard (which included patients with both microbiologically confirmed as well as 
      clinically diagnosed TB), SILVAMP-LAM sensitivity was 65.8% (95% CI 55.9%-74.6%), 
      and that of LF-LAM 31.4% (95% CI 19.1%-43.7%). In patients with CD4 count ≤ 100 
      cells/μl, SILVAMP-LAM sensitivity was 87.1% (95% CI 79.3%-93.6%), compared to 56.0% 
      (95% CI 43.9%-64.9%) for LF-LAM. In patients with CD4 count 101-200 cells/μl, 
      SILVAMP-LAM sensitivity was 62.7% (95% CI 52.4%-71.9%), compared to 25.3% (95% CI 
      15.8%-34.9%) for LF-LAM. In those with CD4 count > 200 cells/μl, SILVAMP-LAM 
      sensitivity was 43.9% (95% CI 34.3%-53.9%), compared to 10.9% (95% CI 5.2%-18.4%) 
      for LF-LAM. Using a microbiological reference standard, the specificity of 
      SILVAMP-LAM was 90.9% (95% CI 87.2%-93.7%), and that of LF-LAM 95.3% (95% CI 
      92.2%-97.7%). Limitations of this study include the use of biobanked, rather than 
      fresh urine samples, and testing by skilled laboratory technicians in research 
      laboratories, rather than at the point of care. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found 
      that SILVAMP-LAM identified a substantially higher proportion of TB patients in 
      PLHIV than LF-LAM. The sensitivity of SILVAMP-LAM was highest in patients with CD4 
      count ≤ 100 cells/μl. Further work is needed to demonstrate accuracy when 
      implemented as a point-of-care test.

AB  - Piperine a trans-trans isomer of 1-piperoyl-piperidine was evaluated for its 
      immunomodulatory activity to enhance the efficacy of rifampicin in a murine model of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. In-vitro immunomodulation of piperine was 
      tested on mouse splenocytes for lymphocyte proliferation, cytokine production and 
      macrophage activation. Protective efficacy of piperine was tested in a mice 
      infection model of M. tuberculosis for the activation of Th-1 response and 
      synergistic combination efficacy with rifampicin. Murine splenocytes exposed to 
      piperine exhibited proliferation of T and B cell, increased Th-1 cytokines and 
      enhanced macrophage activation. Piperine (1 mg/kg) in mice infected with M. 
      tuberculosis activated the differentiation of T cells into Th-1 sub-population (CD4+ 
      / CD8+ subsets). There was an increase in secretion of Th-1 cytokines (IFN-γ and 
      IL-2) by these cells. The qRT-PCR studies revealed corresponding increases in the 
      mRNA transcripts of IFN-γ and IL-2 in the infected lung tissues. Combination of 
      piperine and rifampicin (1 mg/kg) exhibited better efficacy of and resulted in 
      additional 1.4 to 0.8 log reduction in lung cfu as compared to rifampicin alone. The 
      up-regulation of Th1 immunity by piperine can be synergistically combined with 
      rifampicin to improve its therapeutic efficacy in immune-compromised TB patients.

TI  - Purified protein derivative of tuberculin upregulates the expression of vascular 
      endothelial growth factor in T lymphocytes in vitro.
PG  - 96-101
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the cellular source and significance of 
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which, as reported previously, is elevated 
      in the sera of pulmonary tuberculous patients. We obtained peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 28 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, from 
      11 healthy controls who were positive for purified protein derivative of tuberculin 
      (PPD), and from eight healthy individuals who were negative for PPD. We incubated 
      the PBMCs with PPD in the presence or absence of major histocompatibility (MHC) 
      class I or class II antibody in vitro, and measured the VEGF levels of culture 
      supernatants. We also analysed the source of cells that secrete VEGF by using flow 
      cytometry with intracellular staining. The T lymphocytes of active tuberculous 
      patients secreted a higher level of VEGF than those of healthy controls. This 
      production of VEGF was inhibited by adding MHC class II antibody. The addition of 
      MHC class I antibody, however, did not inhibit. We propose that CD4+ T lymphocytes 
      are almost certainly the cells that produce VEGF in response to PPD. VEGF production 
      might be associated with an antigen-specific immune reaction via CD4+ T lymphocytes 
      in tuberculosis.

TI  - Nonspecific and immune-specific up-regulation of cytokines in rabbit dermal 
      tuberculous (BCG) lesions.
PG  - 440-50
AB  - To our knowledge, this is the first sequential study of cytokines in tissue sections 
      of developing and healing tuberculous (BCG) lesions. In situ hybridization, 
      immunohistochemical, and RT-PCR techniques were used. Cytokine mRNAs showed a 
      biphasic pattern. The percentage of mononuclear cells (MN) containing IL-1beta, 
      TNF-alpha, MCP-1, and IL-8 mRNAs was highest in 1- to 3-day lesions, apparently 
      because of the nonspecific inflammatory response caused by the tubercle bacilli in 
      the BCG vaccine. At 5 days, this percentage was significantly reduced. With 
      IFN-gamma, the peak and trough were delayed by 2 days. By 9 days, the percentage of 
      MN containing the mRNAs of all five cytokines had again increased and the rabbits 
      had become tuberculin-positive. In general, MCP-1 and TNF-alpha proteins and the 
      vascular adhesion molecules, ICAM, VCAM, and perhaps ELAM, peaked at about 3 days. 
      Many mononuclear cells surrounding the central areas of solid and liquefied caseous 
      necrosis contained chemokine IL-8 mRNA. IL-8 is known to attract PMN, and PMN were 
      present nearby. In contrast, MN containing chemokine MCP-1 mRNA were present more 
      peripherally in areas rich in macrophages and lymphocytes. The early nonspecific 
      cytokine response seems to be an adjuvant effect of the mycobacteria in BCG vaccine 
      in that it causes a rapid entry of macrophages, lymphocytes, granulocytes, and 
      probably dendritic cells into local sites of antigen deposition. This effect should 
      be considered in developing improved vaccines for the prevention of tuberculosis, 
      because BCG vaccines producing a strong early cytokine response should be more 
      immunogenic than BCG vaccines with similar antigens producing a weak response.

TI  - [Expression of lymphotactin in renal tuberculosis].
PG  - 62-3
AB  - AIM: To study the expression of lymphotactin in normal kidney and renal tuberculosis 
      and the arrangement of lymphotactin and infiltrating CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T 
      cells in renal tuberculosis. METHODS: HLptn cDNA of tissues from six cases with 
      normal kidneys and ten cases with tuberculous kidneys was amplified by RT-PCR. The 
      RT-PCR products were separated with 2% of gel. The cDNA was cloned to vector pGM-T 
      Easy and was completely sequenced. The immunohistochemical staining method was used 
      to examine the expression of lymphotactin in normal kidneys and tuberculous kidneys 
      and the expression of CD4 and CD8 in tuberculous kidneys. RESULTS: The sequence of 
      cloned hLptn cDNA was confirmed and it was identical with the sequence of NO.U23772 
      published in GenBank. Both normal kidneys and tuberculous kidneys expressed hLptn 
      mRNA. HLptn was detected not only in the cells of normal renal glomerulus and renal 
      tubule but also in the cells of remaining renal glomerulus and renal tubule of 
      tuberculous kidneys. The cells expressing surface antigens CD4 and CD8 scattered in 
      granulomas. CONCLUSION: The constructive expression of hLptn is in the cells of 
      renal glomerulus and renal tubule of normal kidney and tuberculous kidney. The 
      accumulation of CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells in granulomas may not depend on 
      hLptn.

TI  - [A case of pulmonary tuberculosis preceded by skin tuberculosis].
PG  - 618-21
AB  - We report a case of pulmonary tuberculosis, which was preceded by skin tuberculosis. 
      65-year old male was admitted to our hospital complaining of skin eruption which 
      last one year. Skin biopsy proved granuloma with acid-fast bacilli. Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis was detected by PCR examination using skin biopsy and skin tuberculosis 
      was confirmed. Chest roentogenography demonstrated small nodules with bilateral 
      infiltrates compatible with pulmonary tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis was attained by 
      culture examination using sputa sample. In this case, skin tuberculosis was a first 
      clinical sign to suggest pulmonary tuberculosis. Peripheral blood test showed that 
      he has developed adult T-cell leukemia and this could be an important factor for 
      developing skin tuberculosis. Although skin tuberculosis becomes rare disease, 
      physician should pay attention for this disease as differential diagnosis of lasting 
      eruption.

AB  - PURPOSE: Two hundred and fifty-three patients were included in a study on the 
      etiology of encephalitis, carried out in France in 2007. Tuberculosis was the second 
      most frequently identified cause, after HSV and with the same number of cases as 
      VZV. The authors report the specific features of patients presenting with 
      tuberculosis encephalitis (TE). METHODS: TE patients were defined as patients 
      presenting with encephalitis, with positive culture or PCR for Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis, or the association of clinical, biological, imaging, and 
      epidemiological evidence (possible cases). Clinical, microbiological, and brain 
      imaging data was analyzed and compared to that of other included patients. RESULTS: 
      Twenty cases of TE were identified. The M/F sex-ratio was 1.5, the mean age 53 
      years. Four (20%) patients had a history of tuberculosis before the encephalitis. 
      The median delay between the onset of general and neurological symptoms was 
      significantly longer for tuberculosis cases than for others (10 days vs. 2; 
      P<10(-10)). The median CSF protein level was significantly higher for tuberculosis 
      cases (2.1 g/L vs. 0.8 g/L, P=0.002). CT scan and MRI were normal on admission for 
      eight patients out of 17. Fourteen isolated strains of M. tuberculosis were 
      susceptible to first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs and one was rifampicin-resistant. 
      Six (33%) patients died during hospitalization and two were lost to follow-up. Ten 
      out of 12 (78.6%) had persisting neurological symptoms on discharge. DISCUSSION: 
      Despite non-multiresistant MT strains, the case fatality rate among TE patients was 
      high in our series. Early brain imaging is poor contributive for the diagnosis of 
      TE.

TI  - Pathological and immunological profiles of rat tuberculosis.
PG  - 125-34
AB  - To investigate the pathological and immunological profiles of rat tuberculosis, 
      Lewis female rats were infected aerially with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
      Histopathology, immunological profiles of mononuclear cells from M. 
      tuberculosis-infected rat lung tissue, and the expression patterns of cytokine and 
      iNOS mRNAs were examined over time. M. tuberculosis induced granulomatous lesions in 
      the lungs, spleen, lymph nodes and liver, but these lesions lacked central necrosis. 
      Multinucleate giant cells were observed in late-phase tuberculosis. CD4(+) and 
      CD8(+) T cells increased with time and reached a peak 5 weeks after infection, 
      decreasing gradually thereafter. ED1 antigen, suggestive of alveolar macrophages, 
      was expressed at a high level in early phase tuberculosis and remained at the same 
      level even in the late phase. OX62 antigen increased gradually and reached a peak 5 
      weeks after infection. Interferon-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and iNOS mRNAs 
      were expressed strongly over time, but their expression decreased 12 weeks after 
      infection. Because rat tuberculosis is very similar to murine tuberculosis and it is 
      easy to obtain mononuclear cells from M. tuberculosis-infected rat lung tissue, the 
      rat tuberculosis model appears to be suitable for immunological studies in vivo.

TI  - Lower HIV-2 plasma viral loads may explain differences between the natural histories 
      of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections.
PG  - 257-63
AB  - To explain the low transmissibility and pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection's plasma 
      viral loads in both HIV-1- and HIV-2-infected persons were compared by using the 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based Amp-RT assay to measure levels of reverse 
      transcriptase (RT) activity. The study comprised a total of 155 HIV-infected-people 
      including 58 who were infected with HIV-2 with CD4+ cell counts <500 x 106/L (n = 
      15), CD4+ cell counts >500 x 106/L (n = 26), or with tuberculosis (TB; n = 17), and 
      97 HIV-1-infected people with CD4+ cell counts <500 x 106/L (n = 32), CD4+ cell 
      counts >500 x 106/L (n = 25), or TB (n = 40). Among persons with CD4+ cell counts 
      <500 x 106/L, 11 (73.3%) of 15 HIV-2-infected persons had detectable plasma RT 
      activity compared with 25 (78.1%) of 32 HIV-1-infected persons (p =.725). However, 
      the median HIV-2 plasma RT activity in this group was significantly lower (2561 x 
      10-10 U/ml; p =.036; detectable range, 1712-644,868 x 10-10 U/ml) than the RT 
      activity of HIV-1-infected persons with similar CD4+ cell counts (13,241 x 10-10 
      U/ml; detectable range, 8482-1,478,880 x 10-10 U/ml). Among TB patients, 10 (58.8%) 
      of 17 HIV-2-infected persons had detectable plasma RT activity compared with 30 
      (75%) of 40 HIV-1-infected persons (p =.342). In contrast, among patients with CD4+ 
      cell counts >500 x 106/L, none of 26 HIV-2-infected persons had detectable RT 
      activity compared with 13 (52%) of 25 HIV-1-infected persons (p <.001). Our data 
      suggest that unlike HIV-1 infection, HIV-2 infections with CD4+ cell counts >500 x 
      106/L are associated with a low level of viral replication, which may explain the 
      longer clinical latency and lower transmissibility seen in HIV-2 infection.

TI  - Primary and opportunistic pathogens associated with meningitis in adults in Bangui, 
      Central African Republic, in relation to human immunodeficiency virus serostatus.
PG  - 387-95
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the causative organisms and characteristics of patients 
      presenting with meningitis in Bangui in order to provide guidance to physicians for 
      case management. METHODS: Adults with proven or suspected meningitis were enrolled 
      in this prospective study. LABORATORY TESTS: Full blood count, blood chemistry, and 
      HIV tests were performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was submitted for routine 
      microbiology, chemistry (glucose, protein), and hematology testing. When classical 
      microbiology analyses were negative, a broad-range bacterial polymerase chain 
      reaction (BRBPCR) was used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Of the 276 patients enrolled, 
      215 (77.9%) were HIV positive. In HIV-positive patients cryptococcal meningitis (CM) 
      was the most common cause of meningitis (39.1%) followed by pyogenic meningitis (PM) 
      (30.7%), mononuclear meningitis (MM) (28.8%), and tuberculous meningitis (TM) 
      (1.4%). In HIV-negative patients, PM was the most common cause (60.7%) followed by 
      MM (37.7%) and CM (1.6%, one case). In-hospital mortality was higher in HIV-positive 
      patients (73/128 = 57%) compared to those HIV negative (3/18 = 16.7%) (p = 0.001). 
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 26) was the most common bacterial diagnosis, mainly in 
      HIV-positive patients (n = 22, 10.2%). Meningococcal meningitis (14 Neisseria 
      meningitidis of group A and one W135) was diagnosed in nine (4.2%) HIV-positive and 
      six (9.8%) HIV-negative patients. Gram-negative rods were isolated from five 
      HIV-positive and two HIV-negative patients, respectively. The bacteria and fungi 
      involved in meningitis did not display high levels of in vitro resistance. 
      Conventional microbiology techniques failed to detect the causative agent in 55 
      (53.4%) PM cases. Broad-range bacterial PCR detected DNA from S. pneumoniae in three 
      samples, N. meningitidis in two, Escherichia coli in one, Listeria monocytogenes in 
      two and Staphylococcus aureus in one sample. In the CSF of five (three HIV negative 
      and two HIV positive), PCR products were not identified with the oligonucleotide 
      probes specific for the usual species of bacteria found in CSF, or genera commonly 
      considered potential contaminants of clinical samples. Among the MM cases, 77 
      (90.5%) probable viral meningitis (54 HIV positive and 23 HIV negative) and eight TM 
      (HIV positive) were suspected.

AB  - Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a common zoonotic disease, caused by Mycobacterium 
      bovis (M. bovis), responsible for significant economic losses worldwide. Its 
      diagnosis is based on the detection of cell mediated immunity under the exposure to 
      protein purified derivative tuberculin (PPD), a complex and poorly characterized 
      reagent. The cross-reactivity to non-tuberculous mycobacterium species 
      (false-positive results) has been crucial to develop a more proper antigen. In the 
      present study, we selected six M. bovis Open Reading Frames (Mb1992, Mb2031c, 
      Mb2319, Mb2843c, Mb2845c and Mb3212c) by in-silico analysis and evaluated them in 
      experimental and natural infection; none of these antigens had been previously 
      assessed as diagnostic antigens for bTB. The reactivity performance was tested in 
      animals with both positive and negative Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) results as well 
      as in cattle infected with Mycobacterium avium subesp. paratuberculosis (MAP). The 
      six recombinant antigens individually induced an IFN-γ response, with overall 
      responder frequency ranging from 18.3 to 31%. Mb2845c was the most valuable antigen 
      with the potential to discriminate TST-positive cattle from either TST-negative or 
      MAP infected animals. Mb2845c showed similar performance to that observed with 
      ESAT-6 and PPD-B among TST and MTC specific-PCR positive animals, although this 
      result needs to be proven in further studies with a higher sample size. Our data 
      confirm the feacibility to implement bioinformatic screening tools and suggest 
      Mb2845c as a potential diagnostic antigen to be tested in protein cocktails to 
      evaluate their contribution to bTB diagnosis.

TI  - Specific recognition of mycobacterial protein and peptide antigens by γδ T cell 
      subsets following infection with virulent Mycobacterium bovis.
PG  - 2756-69
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1302567 [doi]
AB  - Promoting effective immunity to Mycobacterium bovis infection is a challenge that is 
      of interest to the fields of human and animal medicine alike. We report that γδ T 
      cells from virulent M. bovis-infected cattle respond specifically and directly to 
      complex, protein, and nonprotein mycobacterial Ags. Importantly, to our knowledge, 
      we demonstrate for the first time that bovine γδ T cells specifically recognize 
      peptide Ags derived from the mycobacterial protein complex ESAT6:CFP10 and that this 
      recognition requires direct contact with APCs and signaling through the T cell Ag 
      receptor but is independent of MHC class I or II. Furthermore, we show that M. bovis 
      infection in cattle induces robust IL-17A protein responses. Interestingly, in 
      contrast to results from mice, bovine CD4 T cells, and not γδ T cells, are the 
      predominant source of this critical proinflammatory mediator. Bovine γδ T cells are 
      divided into subsets based upon their expression of Workshop Cluster 1 (WC1), and we 
      demonstrate that the M. bovis-specific γδ T cell response is composed of a 
      heterogeneous mix of WC1-expressing populations, with the serologically defined 
      WC1.1(+) and WC1.2(+) subsets responding in vitro to mycobacterial Ags and 
      accumulating in the lesions of M. bovis-infected animals. The results described in 
      this article enhance our understanding of γδ T cell biology and, because virulent M. 
      bovis infection of cattle represents an excellent model of tuberculosis in humans, 
      contribute to our overall understanding of the role of γδ T cells in the 
      mycobacterial-specific immune response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of Determine TB-LAM (LF-LAM) to 
      screen for tuberculosis among ambulatory adults established in HIV care in South 
      Africa. METHODS: A systematic sample of adults attending for HIV care, regardless of 
      symptomatology, were enrolled in the XPHACTOR study, which tested a novel algorithm 
      for prioritising investigation with Xpert MTB/RIF. In this substudy, restricted to 
      participants with enrolment CD4<200x106/l, urine was stored at enrolment for later 
      testing with LF-LAM. Sputum was sent for immediate Xpert MTB/RIF if any of: current 
      cough, fever ≥3 weeks, body mass index (BMI)<18.5kg/m2, CD4<100x106/l (or <200x106/l 
      if pre-ART), weight loss ≥10% or strong clinical suspicion were present; otherwise, 
      sputum was stored for Xpert testing at study completion. Participants were reviewed 
      monthly, with reinvestigation if indicated, to 3 months, when sputum and blood were 
      taken for mycobacterial culture. We defined tuberculosis as "confirmed" if Xpert, 
      line probe assay or culture for M. tuberculosis within six months of enrolment were 
      positive, and "clinical" if tuberculosis treatment started without microbiological 
      confirmation. RESULTS: Amongst 424 participants, 61% were female and 57% were taking 
      ART (median duration 22 months); median age, CD4 and BMI were 39 years, 111x106/l, 
      and 23 kg/m2. 56/424 (13%) participants had tuberculosis (40 confirmed, 16 
      clinical). 24/424 (5.7%) vs. 8/424 (1.9%) were LAM-positive using grade 1 vs. grade 
      2 cut-off. Using grade 1 cut-off, sensitivity for confirmed TB (all clinical TB 
      excluded) was 12.5% (95% CI 4.2%, 26.8%) and in CD4<100x106/l vs. CD4 ≥100x106/l was 
      16.7% (95% CI 4.7%, 37.4%) vs. 6.3% (95% CI 0.2%, 30.2%). Specificity was >95% 
      irrespective of diagnostic reference standard, CD4 stratum, or whether grade 1 or 
      grade 2 cut-off was used. CONCLUSION: Sensitivity of LF-LAM is too low to recommend 
      as part of intensified case finding in ambulatory patients established in HIV care.

TI  - Compartmentalized bronchoalveolar IFN-gamma and IL-12 response in human pulmonary 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 38-47

AB  - Human tuberculosis (TB) principally involves the lungs, where local immunity impacts 
      on the load of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). Because concomitants of local Th1 
      immunity are still under-explored in humans, we characterized immune responses in 
      bronchoalveolar cells (BACs) and systemically in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMCs) in persons with active pulmonary TB and in healthy community controls. PPD- 
      and live M.tb-induced IFN-gamma-production were observed in CD4(+), CD8(+), 
      gammadeltaTCR(+), and CD56(+) alveolar T cell subpopulations and NK cells 
      (CD3(-)CD56(+)). IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) T cells (mostly CD45RO(+)) were more 
      abundant (p<0.05). M.tb-induced IL-12p70, but interestingly also IL-4, was increased 
      (p<0.05) in BACs from TB patients. Constitutive expression of IL-12Rbeta1 and 
      IL-12Rbeta2 mRNA in BACs and PBMCs and IFN-gammaR1 in BACs was similar in both study 
      groups. Data were normalized to account for differences in proportions of alveolar T 
      cells and macrophages in the study groups. IFN-gamma-production and its induction by 
      IL-12R engagement occur virtually unimpaired in the bronchoalveolar spaces of 
      patients with pulmonary TB. The reasons for the apparent failure to control M. 
      tuberculosis growth during active pulmonary TB disease is unknown but could be the 
      expression of locally acting immunosuppressive mechanisms that subvert the 
      antimycobacterial effects of IFN-gamma.

TI  - Evaluating diagnostic tests for bovine tuberculosis in the southern part of Germany: 
      A latent class analysis.

AB  - Germany has been officially free of bovine tuberculosis since 1996. However, in the 
      last years there has been an increase of bovine tuberculosis cases, particularly in 
      the southern part of Germany, in the Allgäu region. As a consequence a one-time 
      tuberculosis surveillance program was revisited with different premortal and 
      postmortal tests. The aim of this paper was to estimate diagnostic sensitivities and 
      specificities of the different tests used within this surveillance program. In the 
      absence of a perfect test with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, thus in the 
      absence of a gold standard, a Bayesian latent class approach with two different 
      datasets was performed. The first dataset included 389 animals, tested with single 
      intra-dermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test, PCR and pathology; the 
      second dataset contained 175 animals, tested with single intra-dermal cervical 
      tuberculin (SICT) test, Bovigam® assay, pathology and culture. Two-way conditional 
      dependencies were considered within the models. Additionally, inter-laboratory 
      agreement (five officially approved laboratories) of the Bovigam® assay was assessed 
      with Cohen's kappa test (21 blood samples). The results are given in posterior means 
      and 95% credibility intervals. The specificities of the SICT test, SICCT test, PCR 
      and pathology ranged between 75.8% [68.8-82.2%] and 99.0% [96.8-100%]. The Bovigam® 
      assay stood out with a very low specificity (6.9% [3.6-11.1%]), though it had the 
      highest sensitivity (95.7% [91.3-99.2%]). The sensitivities of the SICCT test, PCR, 
      SICT test, pathology and culture varied from 57.8% [48.0-67.6%] to 88.9% 
      [65.5-99.7%]. The prevalences were 19.8% [14.6-26.5%] (three-test dataset) and 7.7% 
      [4.2-12.3%] (four-test dataset). Among all pairwise comparisons the highest 
      agreement was 0.62 [0.15-1]). In conclusion, the specificity of the Bovigam® assay 
      and the inter-laboratory agreement were lower than expected.

TI  - Type I and Type II Interferon Coordinately Regulate Suppressive Dendritic Cell Fate 
      and Function during Viral Persistence.
PG  - e1005356
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005356 [doi]
LID - e1005356
AB  - Persistent viral infections are simultaneously associated with chronic inflammation 
      and highly potent immunosuppressive programs mediated by IL-10 and PDL1 that 
      attenuate antiviral T cell responses. Inhibiting these suppressive signals enhances 
      T cell function to control persistent infection; yet, the underlying signals and 
      mechanisms that program immunosuppressive cell fates and functions are not well 
      understood. Herein, we use lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection (LCMV) to 
      demonstrate that the induction and functional programming of immunosuppressive 
      dendritic cells (DCs) during viral persistence are separable mechanisms programmed 
      by factors primarily considered pro-inflammatory. IFNγ first induces the de novo 
      development of naive monocytes into DCs with immunosuppressive potential. Type I 
      interferon (IFN-I) then directly targets these newly generated DCs to program their 
      potent T cell immunosuppressive functions while simultaneously inhibiting 
      conventional DCs with T cell stimulating capacity. These mechanisms of monocyte 
      conversion are constant throughout persistent infection, establishing a system to 
      continuously interpret and shape the immunologic environment. MyD88 signaling was 
      required for the differentiation of suppressive DCs, whereas inhibition of 
      stimulatory DCs was dependent on MAVS signaling, demonstrating a bifurcation in the 
      pathogen recognition pathways that promote distinct elements of IFN-I mediated 
      immunosuppression. Further, a similar suppressive DC origin and differentiation was 
      also observed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, HIV infection and cancer. 
      Ultimately, targeting the underlying mechanisms that induce immunosuppression could 
      simultaneously prevent multiple suppressive signals to further restore T cell 
      function and control persistent infections.

TI  - Increased risk of antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity in individuals with 
      glutathione S-transferase M1 'null' mutation.
PG  - 1033-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogenesis and genetic factors influencing predisposition to 
      antituberculosis drug (ATD)-induced hepatotoxicity are not clear. Polymorphism at 
      the genetic locus of a drug and xenobiotic compound metabolizing enzyme, 
      N-acetyltransferase type 2 (NAT2), is reported to be associated with the excess 
      generation of toxic reactive metabolites. Polymorphisms at the glutathione 
      S-transferase (GST) loci (GSTM1 and GSTT1) are involved in the detoxification of 
      these toxic metabolites in the human body to a lesser extent. We have examined 
      whether polymorphisms at these loci are associated with the risk of ATD-induced 
      hepatotoxicity. METHODS: In this case-control study, 33 pulmonary tuberculosis 
      patients with ATD-induced hepatotoxicity and 33 pulmonary tuberculosis patients 
      receiving ATD drugs without any evidence of hepatotoxicity were considered as cases 
      and controls, respectively. Point mutations at NAT2 and homozygous 'null' mutations 
      at GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes were looked into genomic DNA, isolated from peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The 
      frequency of homozygous 'null' mutation at the GSTM1 gene was significantly higher 
      among cases (n = 17, 52%) than controls (n = 8, 24%) (P < 0.05, relative risk 2.13, 
      95% CI: 1.25-3.10). Frequencies of mutations at GSTT1 and NAT2 genes did not differ 
      significantly between cases and controls. CONCLUSION: Homozygous 'null' mutation at 
      the GSTM1 gene might predispose an individual to ATD-induced hepatotoxicity.

TI  - In vivo evidence for a non-T cell origin of interleukin-5.
PG  - 288-92
AB  - Eosinophil myelopoiesis is to a great extent regulated by interleukin (IL)-5. 
      Analysis of IL-5 mRNA in spleen cell preparations by reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed the presence of message 
      for this cytokine in uninfected severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. This 
      message was increased following Mycobacterium avium infection. Normal BALB/c mice 
      had higher levels of expression of IL-5 but the expression of this cytokine was 
      reduced during M. avium infection. Anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody administration in 
      vivo to SCID mice reduced the number of peritoneal and splenic eosinophils. Gamma 
      interferon (IFN-gamma) had an inhibitory effect of eosinophilopoiesis during 
      infection of SCID mice by M. avium since neutralization of this cytokine increased 
      the number of eosinophils detected in the peritoneal cavity of infected animals. Our 
      results suggest that IL-5 may be produced by cells other than T cells that are both 
      able to respond to infection and are under the control of IFN-gamma.

AB  - Prolactin receptor (PRLr) is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily 1 showing 
      tissue specific structural diversity. Expression of PRLr isoforms in lymphoid 
      tissues has been associated with immunomodulatory function of prolactin. Bovine 
      tuberculosis (bTB) is characterized by chronic inflammation caused by the persistent 
      infection of lymphoid tissues with Mycobacterium bovis. To test the hypothesis of 
      the influence of PRLr in the pathogenesis of bTB, the aim of this study was to 
      identify PRLr isoforms expressed during bTB in different tissues and to analyze 
      their association with the pathogenesis of bTB. We examined lymphoid and 
      non-lymphoid tissues ex vivo from experimentally and naturally infected cattle, as 
      well as from bTB-free cattle, by Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IH). In 
      vitro, monocytes from exposed, infected, and healthy cattle were stimulated with M. 
      bovis antigens and then analyzed by WB. To detect transcriptional levels of PRLr in 
      macrophages (MØ) exposed to M. bovis, real time PCR was performed. WB revealed 
      diversity of PRLr isoforms in tissues from infected cattle but not in tissues from 
      bTB-free cattle. PRLr isoforms 100 kDa 75, 50 and 40 were found expressed in tissues 
      of animals infected with M. bovis, while only the short isoform of 40 kDa correlated 
      with the immunopathology and ability to infect MØ. We confirmed the synthesis of 
      PRLr mRNA in MØ after M. bovis exposure and propose that molecular pathogen patterns 
      of M. bovis might modulate inflammation during bTB through expression of the PRLr 
      isoform in MØ.

TI  - The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric gene vaccine.
PG  - 1315-23
AB  - DNA vaccination has emerged as a powerful approach in the search for a more 
      efficacious vaccine against tuberculosis (TB). In this study, we evaluated the 
      immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric gene vaccine. The 
      Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the eukaryotic 
      expression vector pCI-neo. C57BL/6N mice were vaccinated with Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric 
      gene vaccine for three times at 3 weeks intervals. Four weeks after the final 
      inoculation, three mice per group were sacrificed to assess cytokine response and 
      CTL induction and the other five mice per group were challenged intravenously in a 
      lateral tail vein with 1 x 10(6) CFU of virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. 
      Spleen and the left lung were harvested from each mouse at 4 weeks after infection 
      and homogenized in sterile saline. Serial dilutions of organ homogenates were plated 
      on L-J agar and incubated 37 degrees C until colonies were visible 4 weeks later. 
      Protective efficacies in each experiment were expressed as reduced CFU and were 
      compared with the negative control group. The right lung was obtained from each 
      mouse and immediately inflated with and stored in 10% formalin saline. Tissues were 
      embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. 
      Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric gene vaccine induced the secretion of more of Th1 cytokines, 
      but not IL-4 and enhanced CTL activity. Mice immunized with Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric 
      gene vaccine had fewer and smaller tubercles than control groups. As expected, 
      control mice had the highest bacterial loads in both lung and spleen. Immunization 
      with Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric gene vaccine could remarkably reduced CFU counts in 
      organs. When it was used to construct the chimeric gene vaccine, hIL-12 could 
      improve the immune efficacy of Mtb8.4 gene vaccine.

TI  - [Central nervous system tuberculosis with and without HIV infection--clinical, 
      neuroimaging, and neuropathological study].
PG  - 209-17
AB  - Clinical data, neuroimaging, and neuropathology of 17 patients with central nervous 
      system tuberculosis were reported. Of this population, 12 were men, 5, women; ages 
      ranged from 23 to 75 years (mean, 46.9). There were three HIV positive patients 
      among them. More than a half of patients had disturbance of consciousness as initial 
      symptom. Neurological signs were variable such as visual acuity loss, hemiparesis, 
      paraparesis, cerebellar ataxia, and tremor, though disturbance of consciousness was 
      the most frequent (36%). Neuroimaging (X-ray CT and MRI) revealed meningeal 
      enhancement (53%), tuberculoma (50%), hydrocephalus, infarction or bleeding and 
      spinal cord tuberculoma. There were three patients who showed paradoxical 
      progression. Eleven patients were performed CSF examination, all of them revealed 
      increased cell count (mean, 206 counts/mm3) and protein (mean, 225 mg/dl), but only 
      4 patients were positive on bacteriological examination including PCR. Seven 
      patients died and 5 patients were performed autopsy. Neuropathologically, all 
      patients showed a stage of meningitis prominent on basal brain (basal cistern and/or 
      Sylvian fissure). Cell infiltrations including lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinocyte 
      were most severe around blood vessels, and observed in all cases except one which 
      showed only fibroblast and collagen fibers indicating healed stage. In some cases, 
      there existed epithelioid cells and Langhans giant cells, and in some cases, fibrin 
      exudate. There were three cases having tuberculoma, one HIV case and two non-HIV 
      cases. Center of tuberculoma in non-HIV case was formed by caseous necrosis, and 
      tuberculoma was surrounded by granuloma constituted by epithelioid cells and 
      Langhans giant cells with lymphocyte cell infiltration and proliferation of blood 
      vessels. In contrast, tuberculoma of HIV case did not include granuloma, and was 
      formed with small cells with large nucleus which surrounded arteries. Our studies, 
      as other studies, failed to show any differences between HIV and non-HIV patients 
      clinically, as well as on neuroimaging study. But neuropathological study suggests 
      that mechanism of tuberculoma formation may be different between in HIV positive 
      patients and in non-HIV patients.

TI  - The value of SHOX2 methylation test in peripheral blood samples used for the 
      differential diagnosis of lung cancer and other lung disorders.
PG  - 246-53

AB  - Methylation of the cytosine residues within the CpG dinucleotides plays an important 
      role in the fundamental cellular processes, human diseases and even cancer. The DNA 
      methylation represents a very stable sign and therefore may be used as a valuable 
      marker for cancer screening. Epigenetic cancer biomarkers are independent of 
      classical morphology and thus show extensive potential to overcome the limitations 
      of cytology. Several epigenetic cancer markers have been reported to be detectable 
      in body fluids such as bronchial aspirate, sputum, plasma and serum.Short stature 
      homeobox gene 2 (SHOX2) encodes a homeo-domain transcription factor, which has been 
      identified as a close homologue of the SHOX gene and both genes are involved in 
      skeletogenesis and heart development. Methylation of SHOX2 gene has been shown to be 
      present at high prevalence in carcinomas of lung, however may also be used to 
      identify other tumour entities.In the presented study, we have compared suitability 
      of two types of material associated with lung cancer for the detection of SHOX2 
      methylation. We have confirmed that methylation of SHOX2 gene represents reliable 
      marker of lung malignancies. The parallel tests in the blood plasma revealed that it 
      may represent a good alternative material for testing of the SHOX2 methylation, 
      making the test available to patients who are unable to undergo bronchoscopy.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: What is the effect of latent genital tuberculosis (GTB) on ovarian 
      reserve in infertile women? SUMMARY ANSWER: Women with latent GTB have lower ovarian 
      reserves and yield lower numbers of oocytes in IVF. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Limited 
      evidence suggests that women with GTB may have a low ovarian reserve. Infertile 
      women have a high incidence of latent GTB and treatment improves fertility outcomes. 
      STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective study from February 2013 to January 
      2016 compared 431 infertile women diagnosed with latent GTB (Group I) to 453 
      infertile women without latent GTB (Group II). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, 
      METHODS: The study was conducted at Shreyas Hospital, Kolhapur, India, a tertiary 
      referral centre for infertility. Women of both groups were 21-38 years of age. Group 
      I consisted of infertile women with proven tubal patency but with latent GTB 
      diagnosed by DNA PCR testing of an endometrial biopsy. Day 2-4 anti-Mullerian 
      hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC) were assessed in both groups. All 
      women with latent GTB took antituberculosis therapy (ATT). Gonadotropin dosages and 
      oocyte and embryo details were noted in both groups for those who underwent IVF. 
      MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Women with latent GTB were younger (29.8 ± 4.4 
      years vs. 30.8 ± 4.5 years; P = 0.003) and, following adjustment for age, had 
      significantly lower AMH [Median (IQR): 2 (0.9, 4.1) ng/ml vs 2.8 (1.3, 5) ng/ml; P = 
      0.01] and AFC [Median (IQR): 7 (5, 11) vs 8 (5, 14); P < 0.001]. Post ATT, women 
      with latent GTB yielded fewer oocytes (9.3 ± 7.6 vs. 10.9 ± 8.1; P = 0.01), but had 
      more grade I embryos transferred (1.1 ± 0.5 vs. 0.89 ± 1.0; P = 0.001) and a better 
      implantation rate (26.8% vs. 17.5%; P = 0.004) in IVF compared to women in Group II. 
      Group I had a higher pregnancy rate compared to Group II (51.6% vs. 40.5%; P = 
      0.001), through various treatment modalities. Considering the adequacy of the sample 
      size and use of robust ovarian reserve markers, the role of chance is minimal. 
      LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: The study is limited to an infertile population 
      visiting a tertiary referral centre. The mechanisms by which latent GTB infection 
      would lead to ovarian damage are unclear. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: It is 
      believed that latent GTB is without any clinical significance. However, a low 
      ovarian reserve in young women with latent GTB necessitates considering it as a 
      cause of infertility, in women with prolonged infertility. These women may 
      experience an accelerated decline in ovarian reserve with reduced success in 
      achieving biological parenthood. Clinicians must be aware of this condition and its 
      consequences while managing infertility. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This 
      study was funded by Sushrut Assisted Conception Clinic, Shreyas Hospital, Kolhapur,

AB  - RATIONALE: We present a rare case of multiple tuberculous mycotic aneurysm. Multiple 
      aneurysms caused by tuberculosis (TB) are difficult to treat. Here, we discuss a 
      treatment modality using a microcore stent graft. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 73-year-old 
      man with pain in the back and on the right side of the chest associated with dry 
      cough, presented with an inability to walk since 1-month. DIAGNOSES: A diagnosis of 
      multiple aneurysms caused by TB was made, based on computed tomography (CT) scan and 
      positive T-spot and Xpert tests. INTERVENTIONS: We administered the empirical 
      anti-TB regimen (pyrazinamide, isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol) and performed 
      endovascular repair using microcore stent graft. OUTCOMES: The post-operative 
      hemodynamic analysis indicated that the patient's aneurysms no longer had a risk of 
      rupture, and blood flow in the major branches of the aorta had been maintained. 
      However, the patient could not survive due to a pulmonary infection acquired during 
      recuperation at a local hospital. LESSONS: For multiple tuberculous mycotic 
      aneurysms, anti-TB therapy is inadequate and the microcore stent graft is a feasible 
      option that can improve the hemodynamics in the aneurysms.

TI  - Immune reactions in cattle after immunization with a Mycobacterium paratuberculosis 
      vaccine and implications for the diagnosis of M. paratuberculosis and M. bovis 
      infections.
PG  - 185-95
AB  - After immunization of four calves with a live modified Mycobacterium 
      paratuberculosis vaccine the course of the humoral and cell mediated immune 
      reactions was studied during a 2-year clinical investigation. Furthermore, the 
      possibility of shedding of the vaccine strain and the influence of the vaccination 
      on the tuberculin skin test was determined. In addition to standard procedures 
      recently developed diagnostic methods (antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 
      interferon-gamma test, polymerase chain reaction) were used. A cell-mediated immune 
      reaction, reflected in an increased, specifically induced, interferon-gamma 
      production developed much earlier (1-2 weeks post-immunization) than humoral 
      immunity (8-16 weeks post-gamma immunization). While the increase in antibody titres 
      was transient, declining to extremely low levels 48-60 weeks post-immunization, 
      cell-mediated immunity remained detectable until the end of the investigation. 
      Spread of the vaccine strain into the body and shedding were never detected during 
      the whole course of the study except for one colon site in one calf. As late as 2 
      years after vaccine application positive or doubtful skin reactions against M. bovis 
      purified protein derivative were measured, reflecting possible interference of the 
      immunization with the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. At the end of the 
      investigation, a positive cell-mediated immune reaction was detected the control 
      animal although clinical, pathological and bacteriological examinations gave no 
      indication for a mycobacterial infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis, and Tuberculosis (TB) are 
      three primary communicable infections have the likely potential to cause severe 
      morbidity in prison settings. The prison has the most favorable environment for the 
      transmission of infections. We conducted this survey to determine the prevalence and 
      feasibility of rapid diagnostic tests in an active screening of these infectious 
      diseases in prison. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey conducted in central Jail 
      Gaddani, one of the largest prisons in the Balochistan province of Pakistan. All 
      prisoners, jail staffs, and staff's family members participated. Informed consent 
      obtained from each participant before the screening. Van equipped with digital X-ray 
      linked with Computer-Aided Detection for TB (CAD4TB) software used for testing. 
      Sputum samples tested on Xpert for MTB/RIF assay and blood specimens collected for 
      HIV and hepatitis serology. Diagnosed TB patients enrolled for treatment at Basic 
      Management Unit (BMU), reactive on hepatitis Rapid Diagnostic Tools (RDTs) were 
      referred for further testing and management, while HIV reactive referred to Anti 
      Retro Viral (ARV) center for Anti Retro Viral Treatment (ART). RESULTS: A total of 
      567 participants offered screening, 63% (356) prisoners, 23% (129) staff's family 
      members, and 14% (82) jail staffs. Among tested 10.3% (58/562) were hepatitis 
      seropositive (Hepatitis-C 41 [7.29%] Hepatitis-B, 16 [2.84%] Hepatitis B&C both, 01 
      [0.17%]). In reactive participants, 49 were prisoners, 08 were jail staffs, and 01 
      was the staff's family member. HIV seropositive was 4% (24/566), and all were 
      prisoners. Almost 99% (565/567) screened by digital X-ray, 172 (30%) were with 
      abnormal CAD4TB suggestion (score > 50), out of them sputum of 26% (148) tested on 
      Xpert, and 2% (03) found Mycobacterium tuberculosis Positive (MTB+). A total of five 
      TB patients were detected; out of two were diagnosed clinically. Co-morbidities 
      observed in 15 patients, (01 TB/HIV co-infected, 12 HIV/HCV, 01 HIV/HBV, and 01 
      HBV/HCV). CONCLUSION: The high frequency of infectious diseases in prison is 
      alarming. For limiting the transmission of infections among prison and community, 
      immediate steps are needed to be taken for improvement of prisons condition by 
      application of recommended screening protocols at the time of the first entry of 
      prisoners in prisons.

TI  - Acute meningoencephalitis as initial presentation of human immunodeficiency virus 
      infection: report of two cases.
PG  - 195-8
AB  - Since the advent of pandemic of the human immunodeficiency virus infection, the 
      possible pathogens responsible for acute meningoencephalitis have broadened. Human 
      immunodeficiency virus itself can cause acute meningoencephalitis, and the 
      immunocompromise associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection predisposes 
      the infected patients to acute meningoencephalitis caused by a variety of other 
      infectious or non-infectious etiologies. Here reported are 2 cases of acute 
      meningoencephalitis with history of blood transfusion and travel to southeast Asia; 
      both are positive for screening tests of human immunodeficiency virus infection. One 
      of the pathogen causing central nervous system infection, Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis, was identified by polymerase chain reaction; the other left 
      undiagnosed. It is known that patients of human immunodeficiency virus infection or 
      acquired immunodeficiency syndrome can present with acute central nervous system 
      infection. The need for routine screening of human immunodeficiency virus antibody 
      is currently under debate; nevertheless, the possibility of human immunodeficiency 
      virus infection has to be kept in mind in patients with acute meningoencephalitis.

AB  - AIMS: We employed a combination of diagnostic tests including single cervical 
      tuberculin test (SCT), rapid lateral-flow test (RT), TB-Feron, conventional PCR and 
      culture to investigate the prevalence of Mycobacterium bovis infections in dairy 
      cattle under the intensive dairy production system in Egypt. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 
      total, 2710 dairy cows from 11 herds in six Governorates were tested by SCT and 444 
      (16·4%) were TB reactors. Only 65 cows responded to M. bovis antigen by RT and 
      TB-Feron. A postmortem examination showed that 49 (75·4%) of slaughtered cows have 
      visible lesions. Testing of 215 out 444 SCT reactor cows by culture and PCR using 
      blood and milk samples revealed that M. bovis were more frequently identified in the 
      blood (6·1-20·5%) than milk (2·3-5·6%) samples. Additionally, in this study, we 
      investigated the prevalence and potential risk factors associated with M. bovis 
      infection in dairy farm workers. Overall, 100 dairy farm workers were tested using 
      QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) 
      and 35 (35%) were positive. In all, 23 (23%) of MTC positive were M. bovis positive 
      using PCR. Mycobacterium bovis positive cases were associated with workers who had 
      respiratory signs and did not wash or disinfect their hands after handling cows. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of M. bovis in dairy cows and dairy farm workers under 
      the intensive dairy production system in Egypt is high. It is therefore essential to 
      disseminate effective prevention and control measures to prevent the spread of M. 
      bovis between dairy cows and dairy workers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: 
      This study revealed that the use of RT or TB-Feron as an ancillary test of SCT 
      reactor cows resulted in a significant reduction in the SCT false-positive 
      slaughtered cows. A high prevalence of M. bovis infection among farm workers 
      provides evidence of occupational risk in the intensive dairy production system in 
      Egypt.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In many regions of the world, wild mammals act as reservoir of 
      Mycobacterium bovis, a situation that prevents the eradication of bovine 
      tuberculosis. In order to observe whether a strain isolated from a wild boar, 
      previously tested as highly virulent in a mice model, is also virulent in cattle, we 
      performed cattle experimental inoculation with this strain RESULTS: Groups of 
      Friesian calves were either infected with the wild boar strain M. bovis 04-303 or 
      with the bovine strain NCTC10772 as a control. We found that antigen-specific IFN-γ 
      release in whole blood samples occurred earlier in animals infected with M. bovis 
      04-303. Both M. bovis strains resulted in a positive skin test, with animals 
      infected with the wild boar isolate showing a stronger response. These results and 
      the presence of more severe organ lesions, with granuloma and pneumonic areas in 
      cattle demonstrate that the wild boar isolate is more virulent than the NCTC10772 
      strain. Additionally, we tested the infectivity of the M. bovis strains in guinea 
      pigs and found that M. bovis 04-303 had the highest pathogenicity. CONCLUSIONS: M. 
      bovis strains isolated from wild boars may be pathogenic for cattle, producing TB 
      lesions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We validated the accuracy of host selected signature gene set using 
      unstimulated whole blood (WB), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the 
      diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). METHODS: The unstimulated WB and PBMC from 1417 
      individuals with active pulmonary TB patients, other lung diseases and healthy 
      participants were analyzed using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
      RESULTS: The WB cohort test demonstrates that the combination of GBP5 and KLF2 can 
      differentiate active TB versus HC with sensitivity and specificity of 77.8% and 
      87.1%, respectively; but most importantly active TB versus OD with sensitivity and 
      specificity of 96.1% and 85.2%, respectively. Again during treatment course, the TB 
      score of GBP5 and KLF2, analytes secretion and clinical parameters were found to be 
      associated in disease progression. In the PBMC cohort test, we found that the only 
      and best discriminatory combination was GBP5, DUSP3 and KLF2 inthe active TB versus 
      HC with a sensitivity and specificity of 76.4% and 85.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study reveals that GBP5 and KLF2 may be useful as a diagnostic tool for active 
      TB, also the two-gene set may serve as surrogate biomarkers for monitoring TB 
      therapy.

AB  - Sirtuins (Sirts) regulate several cellular mechanisms through deacetylation of 
      several transcription factors and enzymes. Recently, Sirt2 was shown to prevent the 
      development of inflammatory processes and its expression favors acute Listeria 
      monocytogenes infection. The impact of this molecule in the context of chronic 
      infections remains unknown. We found that specific Sirt2 deletion in the myeloid 
      lineage transiently increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis load in the lungs and liver 
      of conditional mice. Sirt2 did not affect long-term infection since no significant 
      differences were observed in the bacterial burden at days 60 and 120 post-infection. 
      The initial increase in M. tuberculosis growth was not due to differences in 
      inflammatory cell infiltrates in the lung, myeloid or CD4+ T cells. The 
      transcription levels of IFN-γ, IL-17, TNF, IL-6 and NOS2 were also not affected in 
      the lungs by Sirt2-myeloid specific deletion. Overall, our results demonstrate that 
      Sirt2 expression has a transitory effect in M. tuberculosis infection. Thus, 
      modulation of Sirt2 activity in vivo is not expected to affect chronic infection 
      with M. tuberculosis.

AB  - Accurate determination of microRNA expression levels is a prerequisite in using 
      these small non-coding RNA molecules as novel biomarkers in disease diagnosis and 
      prognosis. Quantitative PCR is the method of choice for measuring the expression 
      levels of microRNAs. However, a major obstacle that affects the reliability of 
      results is the lack of validated reference controls for data normalization. Various 
      non-coding RNAs have previously been used as reference controls, but their use may 
      lead to variations and lack of comparability of microRNA data among the studies. 
      Despite the growing number of studies investigating microRNA profiles to 
      discriminate between healthy and disease stages, robust reference controls for data 
      normalization have so far not been established. In the present article, we provide 
      an overview of different reference controls used in various diseases, and highlight 
      the urgent need for the identification of suitable reference controls to produce 
      reliable data. Our analysis shows, among others, that RNU6 is not an ideal 
      normalizer in studies using patient material from different diseases. Finally, our 
      article tries to disclose the challenges to find a reference control which is 
      uniformly and stably expressed across all body tissues, fluids, and diseases.

TI  - Humoral response to Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium in naturally infected ring-neck 
      doves (Streptopelia risoria).
PG  - 216-24

AB  - Creation of a reliable and easy to use serologic test would greatly improve ante 
      mortem diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium and aid in the control of avian 
      mycobacteriosis, particularly in captive birds. In order to determine whether 
      serodiagnostics could be of value in testing ring-neck doves (Streptopelia risoria) 
      for M. a. avium infection, Western blot analysis was used to assess the humoral 
      response of ring-neck doves exposed to M. a. avium, and to evaluate whether an 
      association could be made between the humoral response and necropsy findings, 
      histopathology, culture, and PCR testing. Western blot results were examined for 
      reactivity patterns associating humoral response with infection status, severity and 
      type of lesions (diffuse vs. multifocal granulomatous inflammation) and phenotype 
      (white vs. non-white). A sensitivity of 88.24% and a specificity of 100% were 
      achieved utilizing Western blot analysis to detect M. a. avium infection in 
      ring-neck doves, offering a negative predictive value of 93% and a positive 
      predictive value of 100%. While Western blot analysis results did not reflect lesion 
      severity, lesion type did partially correspond with the humoral response. The 
      findings of the present study indicate that serologic testing can be used as a 
      valuable ante mortem screening tool for identifying ring-neck doves infected with M. 
      a. avium.

TI  - Aseptic meningitis: diagnosis and management.
PG  - 57-63
AB  - The term aseptic meningitis encompasses all types of inflammations of the brain 
      meninges other than that caused by pus producing organisms. It is usually a benign 
      illness. Etiology of aseptic meningitis is very wide and includes many infections - 
      both viral and non viral, drugs, malignancy and systemic illness. The most common 
      cause is viral infection and enteroviruses - Coxsackie and ECHO viruses account for 
      more than half of all cases. Clinical manifestations include headache, fever, 
      malaise, photophobia and meningeal signs. Convulsions, neurological deficits and 
      severe obtundation are rare except with certain non viral infectious meningitis. 
      Diagnostic work up includes blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination and 
      serology for infectious meningitis. The polymerase chain reaction is a rapid and 
      accurate method for detection of microbial DNA in CSF. Treatment is mainly 
      supportive, except for the nonviral infectious etiology.

TI  - NOS2-derived nitric oxide regulates the size, quantity and quality of granuloma 
      formation in Mycobacterium avium-infected mice without affecting bacterial loads.
PG  - 313-23
AB  - Granuloma formation in response to mycobacterial infections is associated with 
      increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) within granuloma 
      macrophages and increased levels of nitrate/nitrite in the sera of infected mice. 
      Continuous treatment with 5 mm or 10 mm l-N6-(1-imino-ethyl)-lysine (L-NIL), a 
      selective NOS2-inhibitor, in acidified drinking water for up to 7 weeks consistently 
      reduced infection-induced nitrate/nitrite to background levels in 
      mycobacteria-infected BALB/c mice. Oral treatment with 5 mm L-NIL initiated at the 
      time of infection significantly exacerbated growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
      but had no effect on Mycobacterium avium colony-forming unit development in the 
      liver, spleen and lungs of intravenously infected mice. In order to examine the role 
      of nitric oxide in mycobacteria-induced granulomatous inflammation in the absence of 
      any effect on the bacterial load, M. avium-infected mice were treated with 5 mm 
      L-NIL from day 1 through 38 and the development of granulomatous lesions in the 
      liver was assessed by histology, immunohistology and 
      reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Computer- and 
      video-assisted morphometry performed at 4 and 7 weeks post-infection showed that 
      treatment with L-NIL led to markedly increased number, cellularity and size of 
      granulomatous lesions in infected mice regardless of the virulence of the M. avium 
      isolate used for infection. Immunohistology of the liver revealed that in mice 
      treated with L-NIL, the numbers of CD3+ T cells, CD21/35+ B cells, CD11b+ 
      macrophages and RB6-8C5+ granulocytes associated with granulomatous lesions was 
      increased. RT-PCR of the liver showed that in L-NIL-treated mice infected with M. 
      avium, mRNA levels of tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-12p40, interferon-gamma, 
      interleukin-10 and interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) were up-regulated, 
      while mRNA levels of interleukin-4, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and MCP-5 
      were similar to those in untreated control infected mice. When M. avium-infected 
      mice were treated with 5 mm L-NIL between the 5th and 12th weeks of infection, 
      similar changes in granuloma number and size were found in the absence of any effect 
      on the bacterial load. These findings demonstrate that nitric oxide regulates the 
      number, size and cellular composition of M. avium-induced granulomas independently 
      of antibacterial effects by modulating the cytokine profile within infected tissues.

TI  - Mechanisms of granuloma formation in murine Mycobacterium avium infection: the 
      contribution of CD4+ T cells.
PG  - 1299-310
AB  - Infection with the virulent Mycobacterium avium strain TMC 724 caused progressive 
      infection in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, while infection with a less virulent strain 
      (M. avium SE 01) resulted in chronically persistent bacterial loads. Livers of mice 
      infected with TMC 724 were characterized by progressively expanding tumor-like 
      infiltrations of epithelioid macrophages, while SE 01 induced well-developed, 
      compact epithelioid granulomas that remained constant in size and number for at 
      least 4 months. When C57BL/6 mice were depleted of CD4+ T cells by i.p. 
      administration of specific mAb at the time of infection, their capacity to initiate 
      granuloma formation was completely abrogated during the first 4 weeks of infection. 
      Semi-quantitative competitive RT-PCR of liver homogenates obtained 3 weeks after 
      infection revealed that depletion of CD4+ T cells was accompanied by a 25-fold 
      reduced expression of IFN-gamma mRNA and a 5-fold reduced expression of tumor 
      necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha mRNA when compared to control infected mice. Granuloma 
      morphology in response to either TMC 724 or SE 01 was similar in immunodeficient 
      SCID mice to that observed in syngeneic BALB/c mice. However, SCID mice developed 
      granulomas in a delayed fashion and were less efficient in surrounding infected 
      Kupffer cells with an inflammatory infiltration. The delayed kinetics of granuloma 
      initiation in infected SCID mice was paralleled by a lower mRNA expression for 
      IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha compared to that observed in infected BALB/c mice. 
      mAb-mediated neutralization of IFN-gamma in BALB/c mice significantly reduced 
      inflammatory infiltrations and granuloma formation. These data support the 
      conclusion that CD4+ T cells accelerate granuloma formation by enhancing the 
      production of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma at the site of infection.

TI  - Interleukin-3 and interleukin-17 do not play a dynamic role in the 
      immunopathogenesis of osteoarticular tuberculosis.
PG  - 142-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Osteoarticular tuberculosis accounts for one to three per cent of all 
      cases of active TB. IL-3 stimulates the proliferation, differentiation and survival 
      of pluripotent stem cells. IL-17 has shown to promote inflammatory cell recruitment 
      and granuloma organization throughout infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
      During the chronic phase of the infection, a balance between Th1 and Th17 responses 
      needs to be achieved to limit immunopathology. AIM: To correlate the serum levels of 
      IL-3 and IL-17 at presentation and after completion of treatment in 
      clinicoradiologically proven cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis. METHODS: 32 
      clinicoradiologically confirmed cases of osteoarticular tuberculosis were included. 
      Archived serum samples of eight patients of osteoarticular tuberculosis of an 
      earlier study, confirmed by PCR, AFB smear or by histopathology with previously 
      determined IL-12 and TGF-beta levels were available. A detailed history was noted 
      and their general physical, local and relevant systemic examination was performed. 
      Various laboratory parameters including TL-3 and IL-17 levels in serum were 
      estimated at presentation and at six months of DOTS CAT-1 treatment. RESULTS: There 
      was a significant improvement in the clinical and radiological parameters after 
      treatment. No correlation was found between IL-3 and IL-17 levels before and after 
      treatment. A significant correlation (p value= 0.022) was shown between levels of 
      IL-3 and IL-12 after six months of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Qualitative and 
      quantitative fluctuations in IL-3 and IL-17 levels were not able to serve as useful 
      indices of disease activity.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains as a leading infectious disease worldwide. Our previous 
      study showed interferon (IFN)-γ and CD3 T cell impairment in patients with severe 
      cavitary pulmonary TB (PTB). However, the cause of the change in immune responses 
      during the progression of TB is still poorly understood. In this study, eight newly 
      diagnosed patients with severe cavitary and mild lesion non-cavity PTB were 
      recruited, and three healthy volunteers were recruited as the control. RNA extracted 
      from blood was tested by whole genome oligo microarrays. A PCR array was used to 
      further test the same samples. Two additional groups of patients were recruited 
      according to the same criteria with healthy control(HC) recruited as well and 
      subjected to peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation (PBMC)and analysis of 
      TCF-7, β-catenin, cyclin D2, IFN-γ, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression in 
      CD14- cells (lymphocytes) and CD14+ cells by quantitative PCR. The changes of 
      expression of β-catenin, CD69+ and IFN-γ by CD3+, CD14- and CD14+ cells in vitro 
      with stimulation of LiCl were tested by flow cytometry. Whole genome oligo 
      microarrays showed a significant decrease in expression of the Wnt signaling pathway 
      in severe PTB patients. Further analysis of the Wnt pathway by PCR array indicated 
      that TCF-7, β-catenin, and cyclin D2 expression was significantly reduced in severe 
      PTB patients compared with mild PTB patients. In the additionally recruited 
      patients, TCF-7, β-catenin, and cyclin D2 were expressed in both CD14+ and CD14- 
      cells, while β-catenin was decreased significantly in CD14- cells compared with 
      CD14+ cells in severe PTB patients, and IFN-γ and TNF-α expression in CD14- cells 
      was also reduced significantly in severe PTB patients. β-catenin can directly 
      trigger T cell activation and IFN-γsecretion in PBMCs stimulated for 24 hours. These 
      findings indicate that Wnt pathway and its key genes, such as β-catenin, were 
      impaired in blood cells of patients with severe PTB. Therefore, Wnt/β-catenin 
      pathway is closely associated with T cell proliferation and TB lesion deterioration.

AB  - Meningeal tuberculosis is a severe type of extrapulmonary disease, which is thought 
      to begin with respiratory infection, followed by hematogenous dissemination and 
      brain infection. Host genetic susceptibility factors and specific mycobacterial 
      substrains could be involved in its development. From an epidemiological study in 
      Colombia, we selected three Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains isolated 
      from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with meningeal tuberculosis, and used 
      them to infect BALB/c mice through the intratracheal route. These strains showed a 
      distinctive spoligotype pattern. The course of infection in terms of strain 
      virulence (mice survival, bacillary loads in lungs), bacilli dissemination and 
      extrapulmonary infection (bacilli loads in blood, brain, liver, kidney and spleen), 
      and immune responses (cytokine expression determined by real time PCR in brain and 
      lung) was studied and compared with that induced by the laboratory strain H37Rv and 
      other five clinical strains isolated from patients with pulmonary TB. All the 
      clinical isolates from meningeal TB patients disseminated extensively through the 
      hematogenous route infecting the brain, producing inflammation in the cerebral 
      parenchyma and meninges, whereas H37Rv and clinical isolates from pulmonary TB 
      patients showed very limited efficiency to infect the brain. Thus, it seems that 
      mycobacterial strains with a distinctive genotype are able to disseminate 
      extensively after the respiratory infection and infect the brain.

AB  - PA-824 is a novel bicyclic nitroimidazole anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug. Cordyceps 
      sinensis (Berk.) Sacc. (CS) was proven to be a good immunomodulatory compound. This 
      research aimed to investigate the effect of CS on PA-824 in Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (M.tb) infected mice (female CBA/J mice, 6 to 8 weeks of age and 20±2 g 
      of weight). Mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups: PA-824, CS, PA-824+CS, and 
      control. To verify the effect of PA-824 and CS on M.tb, after drug administration, 
      mice lungs were harvested and bacterial colony formations were measured. Cells were 
      isolated from infected lungs and spleens to analyze the percentage of CD4+ T cells 
      (CD11a positive). Lung cells were cultured to detect the secretion of interferon-γ 
      (IFN-γ) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) by ELISA. IFN-γ and IL-10 double-positive CD4+ 
      cells in peripheral blood were measured by flow cytometry. The expression levels of 
      IL-2 and IL-10 in mice lungs were analyzed by real-time PCR and western blot. 
      Results showed that PA-824 combined with CS led to the lowest lung colony-forming 
      units (CFU) counts among treated groups. Furthermore, this beneficial outcome might 
      be associated with the decreased CD11a on CD4+ cells in mice lungs and spleens. 
      Moreover, the suppressed secretion of IFN-γ and IL-10, and IL-10 expressions, as 
      well as the decreased IFN-γ and IL-10 double-positive CD4+ cells in blood, could 
      also be associated with the positive effect. However, no significant effect on IL-2 
      production was found. The combination of PA-824 and CS had more effective 
      bacteriostatic and immunomodulatory effects on M.tb infected mice than PA-824 alone. 
      In conclusion, CS has the potential to be an effective adjuvant in TB treatment.

PG  - e31126
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0031126 [doi]
LID - e31126
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid detection of bloodstream infections (BSIs) can be lifesaving. We 
      investigated the sample processing and assay parameters necessary for 
      highly-sensitive detection of bloodstream bacteria, using Staphylococcus aureus as a 
      model pathogen and an automated fluidic sample processing-polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) platform as a model diagnostic system. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We 
      compared a short 128 bp amplicon hemi-nested PCR and a relatively shorter 79 bp 
      amplicon nested PCR targeting the S. aureus nuc and sodA genes, respectively. The 
      sodA nested assay showed an enhanced limit of detection (LOD) of 5 genomic copies 
      per reaction or 10 colony forming units (CFU) per ml blood over 50 copies per 
      reaction or 50 CFU/ml for the nuc assay. To establish optimal extraction protocols, 
      we investigated the relative abundance of the bacteria in different components of 
      the blood (white blood cells (WBCs), plasma or whole blood), using the above assays. 
      The blood samples were obtained from the patients who were culture positive for S. 
      aureus. Whole blood resulted in maximum PCR positives with sodA assay (90% positive) 
      as opposed to cell-associated bacteria (in WBCs) (71% samples positive) or free 
      bacterial DNA in plasma (62.5% samples positive). Both the assays were further 
      tested for direct detection of S. aureus in patient whole blood samples that were 
      contemporaneous culture positive. S. aureus was detected in 40/45 of 
      culture-positive patients (sensitivity 89%, 95% CI 0.75-0.96) and 0/59 negative 
      controls with the sodA assay (specificity 100%, 95% CI 0.92-1). CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      demonstrated a highly sensitive two-hour assay for detection of sepsis causing 
      bacteria like S. aureus directly in 1 ml of whole blood, without the need for blood 
      culture.

TI  - [Down-regulated expression of Blimp-1 mRNA in monocytes from patients with active 
      tuberculosis].
PG  - 949-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the expression of B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 
      (Blimp-1) mRNA in monocytes of patients with active tuberculosis and analyze the 
      differences of the expression among the patients, latent tuberculosis infection 
      subjects and healthy controls (HCs). METHODS: Anticoagulated peripheral blood was 
      collected from patients with active tuberculosis, latent tuberculosis infection 
      subjects and HCs. Monocytes were isolated and purified from the peripheral blood. 
      Fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the mRNA level of Blimp-1 in 
      monocytes. After the monocytes from HCs were stimulated with whole cell lysate of 
      H37Rv MTB and peptide pool of ESAT-6/CFP-10, respectively, the level of Blimp-1 mRNA 
      was again detected by fluorescence quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The level of Blimp-1 
      mRNA in the monocytes from patients with active tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis 
      infection subjects were significantly lower than that from HCs. Compared with the 
      unstimulated monocytes, the level of Blimp-1 mRNA in the monocytes stimulated with 
      whole cell lysate of H37Rv MTB significantly decreased, while the expression of 
      Blimp-1 mRNA in the monocytes stimulated with ESAT-6/CFP-10 was not significantly 
      changed. CONCLUSION: The level of Blimp-1 mRNA in the monocytes from patients with 
      active tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection subjects was down-regulated, 
      and the expression of Blimp-1 mRNA in the monocytes from HCs was also suppressed 
      after stimulated with whole cell lysate of MTB.

TI  - Protection of mice with a divalent tuberculosis DNA vaccine encoding antigens Ag85B 
      and MPT64.
PG  - 269-76
AB  - DNA vaccine may be a promising tool for controlling tuberculosis development. 
      However, vaccines encoding single antigens of mycobacterium did not produce 
      protective effect as BCG did. In the present study, we evaluated the immunogenicity 
      and protective efficacy of a divalent DNA vaccine encoding two immunodominant 
      antigens Ag85B and MPT64 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We found that both humoral 
      and Th1-type (high IFN-gamma, low IL-4) cellular responses obtained from the 
      divalent DNA vaccine group were significantly higher than that conferred by BCG. 
      RT-PCR results showed that antigens were expressed differentially in various organs 
      in divalent DNA vaccine group. The survival rate for mice treated with the divalent 
      DNA vaccine after challenging with high doses of virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv was 
      significantly higher than that of the BCG group or any of the single DNA vaccine 
      group. Significant differences were also found between the single and divalent DNA 
      vaccinated mice in terms of body, spleen and lung weight. Bacterial loading 
      decreased about 2000-fold in lungs and about 100-fold in spleens of divalent DNA 
      vaccinated mice when compared with that of the control group. We conclude that our 
      divalent DNA vaccine may be a better choice for controlling tuberculosis disease in 
      animals.

TI  - The association between microsatellite polymorphisms in intron II of the human 
      Toll-like receptor 2 gene and tuberculosis among Koreans.
PG  - 150-5
AB  - The observation that Toll-like receptor (TLR)2-deficient mice are highly susceptible 
      to mycobacteria suggests that mutations altering TLR2 expression may impair host 
      response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We evaluated the association between 
      guanine-thymine (GT) repeat polymorphism in intron II of the TLR2 gene and the 
      presence of tuberculosis (TB) in Koreans. The numbers of GT repeats were determined 
      by PCR and gene scans for 176 TB patients and 196 controls. The recombinant TLR2 
      promoter/exonI/exonII/intronII/luciferase constructs including three representative 
      repeats: (GT)13, (GT)20, and (GT)24 were transfected into K562 cells, and luciferase 
      activities were estimated and compared. The expression of TLR2 on CD14+ peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers were measured with flow 
      cytometry. Genotypes with shorter GT repeats were more common among TB patients 
      (49.4 vs 37.7%, P=0.02). This observation was confirmed among 82 other TB patients 
      as a validation cohort. Shorter GT repeats were associated with weaker promoter 
      activities and lower TLR2 expression on CD14+ PBMCs. In conclusion, the development 
      of TB disease in Koreans was associated with shorter GT repeats in intron II of the 
      TLR2 gene. This association is correlated with lower expression of TLR2 through 
      weaker promoter activity for genes with shorter GT repeats.

AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is of utmost importance to establish an early 
      diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) infections and to start appropriate 
      therapy. The CSF white cell count, lactate concentration and total protein levels 
      are usually available very quickly even from non-specialized laboratories and the 
      combination of these parameters often provides sufficient information for 
      decision-making in emergency cases. It is, however, not always possible to identify 
      the underlying infective agent despite further CSF analyses, such as bacterial and 
      fungal staining, evaluation of the blood-CSF barrier function, intrathecal 
      immunoglobulin synthesis and oligoclonal IgG bands. Therefore, close communication 
      between the laboratory and the clinician is an important prerequisite to specify 
      additional pathogen-related diagnostic measures for successful confirmation of the 
      diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood transcriptional signatures are candidates for non-sputum triage or 
      confirmatory tests of tuberculosis. Prospective head-to-head comparisons of their 
      diagnostic accuracy in real-world settings are necessary to assess their clinical 
      use. We aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of candidate transcriptional 
      signatures identified by systematic review, in a setting with a high burden of 
      tuberculosis and HIV. METHODS: We did a prospective observational study nested 
      within a diagnostic accuracy study of sputum Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) and Xpert MTB/RIF 
      Ultra (Ultra) tests for pulmonary tuberculosis. We recruited consecutive symptomatic 
      adults aged 18 years or older self-presenting to a tuberculosis clinic in Cape Town, 
      South Africa. Participants provided blood for RNA sequencing, and sputum samples for 
      liquid culture and molecular testing using Xpert and Ultra. We assessed the 
      diagnostic accuracy of candidate blood transcriptional signatures for active 
      tuberculosis (including those intended to distinguish active tuberculosis from other 
      diseases) identified by systematic review, compared with culture or Xpert MTB/RIF 
      positivity as the standard reference. In our primary analysis, patients with 
      tuberculosis were defined as those with either a positive liquid culture or Xpert 
      result. Patients with missing blood RNA or sputum results were excluded. Our primary 
      objective was to benchmark the diagnostic accuracy of candidate transcriptional 
      signatures against the WHO target product profile (TPP) for a tuberculosis triage 
      test. FINDINGS: Between Feb 12, 2016, and July 18, 2017, we obtained paired sputum 
      and RNA sequencing data from 181 participants, 54 (30%) of whom had confirmed 
      pulmonary tuberculosis. Of 27 eligible signatures identified by systematic review, 
      four achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy with similar area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curves (Sweeney3: 90·6% [95% CI 85·6-95·6]; Kaforou25: 
      86·9% [80·9-92·9]; Roe3: 86·9% [80·3-93·5]; and BATF2: 86·8% [80·6-93·1]), 
      independent of age, sex, HIV status, previous tuberculosis, or sputum smear result. 
      At test thresholds that gave 70% specificity (the minimum WHO TPP specificity for a 
      triage test), these four signatures achieved sensitivities between 83·3% (95% CI 
      71·3-91·0) and 90·7% (80·1-96·0). No signature met the optimum criteria, of 95% 
      sensitivity and 80% specificity proposed by WHO for a triage test, or the minimum 
      criteria (of 65% sensitivity and 98% specificity) for a confirmatory test, but all 
      four correctly identified Ultra-positive, culture-negative patients. INTERPRETATION: 
      Selected blood transcriptional signatures met the minimum WHO benchmarks for a 
      tuberculosis triage test but not for a confirmatory test. Further development of the 
      signatures is warranted to investigate their possible effects on clinical and health 
      economic outcomes as part of a triage strategy, or when used as add-on confirmatory 
      test in conjunction with the highly sensitive Ultra test for Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis DNA. FUNDING: Royal Society Newton Advanced Fellowship, Wellcome Trust,

PG  - 520-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-pg) and multidrug 
      resistance-associated protein (MRP) mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells from multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients. METHODS: The subjects 
      of this study included 3 groups: a non-TB control group, a TB control group and a 
      MDR-TB group. The 31 subjects in the non-TB control group were staff from Wuhan 
      Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Institute. The 55 cases in the TB control 
      group were in-patients during September 2004 to December 2007 who were diagnosed as 
      having pulmonary tuberculosis. The 89 cases in the MDR-TB group were in-patients 
      during the same period, but who were diagnosed as having MDR-TB. Peripheral 
      mononuclear cells were isolated and mRNA levels of P-pg and MRP were measured by 
      real-time PCR. Comparisons of the data between different groups were performed using 
      one-way ANOVA, and SNK q was used for comparison between 2 groups. RESULTS: There 
      was no significant difference in the relative P-pg mRNA levels among the MDR-TB 
      group (1.34 ± 0.32), the non-TB control group (1.05 ± 0.16) and the TB control group 
      (1.12 ± 0.23), F = 0.536, P > 0.05. The relative MRP mRNA level (3.45 ± 0.43) was 
      the highest in the MDR-TB group (3.45 ± 0.43), as compared to the TB control group 
      (1.23 ± 0.34) and the non-TB control group (1.04 ± 0.12), F = 24.241, P < 0.05. 
      CONCLUSION: Higher expression of MRP in peripheral mononuclear cells might be 
      related to multidrug resistance in MDR-TB patients.

AB  - Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) is usually elevated in ovarian cancer. However, there 
      are several reports that serum CA-125 is elevated in tuberculosis. This study 
      investigated the clinical significance of serum CA-125 measurements in patients with 
      active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Between September 2008 and March 2011, Serum 
      CA-125 was measured in patients with active pulmonary TB before treatment 
      (baseline), and 6 and 12 months after initiation of anti-TB treatment. Patients with 
      pulmonary TB confirmed by culture or polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (TB-PCR) were included. The study enrolled 100 patients. The mean serum 
      CA-125 was 38.9 ± 41.4 U/ml (reference value, <35 U/ml). Thirty-eight patients 
      showed elevated CA-125. Significantly more of those with elevated CA-125 were female 
      (p < 0.001), and had a positive sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) 
      (p = 0.030). They also significantly more showed extensive pulmonary lesions on 
      chest X-ray (p = 0.004). Elevated CA-125 was independently associated with female 
      gender (OR = 12.5, 95% CI: 3.4-45.2), positive acid-fast staining of sputum 
      (OR = 6.0, 95% CI: 1.8-19.7), cavitary lung lesion (OR = 4.0, 95% CI: 1.2-12.9), and 
      involvement of more than one lung on chest X-ray (OR = 9.4, 95% CI: 2.2-40.1). The 
      CA-125 level decreased with anti-TB treatment (p = 0.001). Serum CA-125 was related 
      to the activity and severity of pulmonary TB, and it may be useful in the monitoring 
      of therapeutic responses in certain cases of active pulmonary TB, especially in 
      female patients of active pulmonary TB.

TI  - Voltammetric immunoassay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis secretory protein MPT64 
      based on a synergistic amplification strategy using rolling circle amplification and

AB  - The authors describe an electrochemical immunoassay for ultrasensitive determination 
      of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) secretory protein MPT64 which is an antigen 
      for early diagnosis of infection with MTb. Protein G was used to immobilize 
      antibodies against MPT64 on a gold electrode. Graphene oxide with its large surface 
      area was used as a carrier to anchor magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) and platinum (Pt) 
      nanoparticles. The nanocomposite of type GO@Fe(3)O(4)@Pt was used as a signal 
      reporter with excellent catalytic activity and recyclability. The nanocomposite 
      exhibits peroxidase-like activity for hydrogen peroxide, best at -0.25 V (vs. 
      Ag/AgCl). It works over a wide range of pH values (2-10) and temperatures 
      (25-65 °C). Further signal amplification strategy was accomplished by rolling circle 
      amplification. This voltammetric assay has a linear response to the logarithm of 
      MPT64 concentration in the range from 5.0 fg·mL(-1) to 1.0 ng·mL(-1) and a detection 
      limit of 0.34 fg·mL(-1) (at a signal to noise ratio of 3, for n = 10). The assay can 
      be completed within 4 h. It was successfully applied to the determination of MPT64 
      in spiked serum samples. Conceivably, the assay has a large potential in providing 
      laboratory evidence for rapid diagnosis of MTb infection. Graphical abstract An 
      electrochemical biosensor was developed for rapid detection of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis secretory protein MPT64. The detection signal was synergistically 
      amplified by GO@Fe(3)O(4)@Pt and rolling circle amplification. Phi29: phi29 DNA 
      polymerase; BSA: bovine serum albumin; GO: graphene oxide.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple infections are the most common problem among HIV infected 
      individuals. The prognostic impact of these co infections in HIV-population in 
      resource-limited countries like Pakistan has not been fully elucidated. The aim of 
      this study was to assess CD4 and hemoglobin (Hb) levels in patients with HIV mono 
      infection and HIV co-infection with Hepatitis C (HCV), Hepatitis B (HBV) and 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). METHODS: A total of 207 HIV positive patients were 
      assessed for CD4 cells count and hemoglobin levels after confirmation of HIV by 
      rapid tests as well as PCR. CD4 counts were performed via flow cytometry whereas 
      hemoglobin levels were performed by Sysmex K-4500 auto-analyzer. RESULTS: Out of 207 
      patients, 22 patients were found to be HIV mono-infected, while 185 patients were 
      HIV positive along with co-infections of MTB or HCV or HBV. We found significant 
      positive correlation between HB levels and CD4 count across the studied group 
      (r=0.30 in HIV mono-infected group, r=0.23 in HIV co-infected group, p<0.05) at 
      baseline. However, majority of the low hemoglobin levels (<8g/dl) and low CD4 count 
      (<200cells/ul) cases were observed particularly in HIV/TB co-infections. CONCLUSION: 
      This study documents the prognostic value of hemoglobin assessment in HIV patients. 
      The results indicate that decreasing Hb levels correlate with decreasing CD4 counts. 
      It is emphasizing that Hb measurement may be used as an inexpensive surrogate marker 
      as compared to CD4 analysis for disease progression in HIV patients. In addition, 
      low Hb levels may also indicate presence of under lying co-infections, particularly, 
      with M. tuberculosis (MTB).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the expression levels of sputum and serum microRNA-144 
      (miR-144) before and after the treatment of patients with tuberculosis (TB). 
      METHODS: Details of the cases of a total of 124 TB patients were collected at Qilu 
      Hospital of Shandong University between April 2014 and April 2015. Fifty-three of 
      these patients had sputum positive for bacteria and a cavity on imaging (group A), 
      20 patients had sputum negative for bacteria and a cavity on imaging (group B), and 
      51 patients had sputum negative for bacteria and no cavity on imaging (group C). One 
      hundred seventeen healthy people who attended the hospital for a physical 
      examination were recruited as controls. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was 
      used to measure the levels of sputum and serum miR-144 before anti-TB treatment and 
      at 1 month after treatment. RESULTS: Before treatment, sputum and serum miR-144 
      expression levels in the TB patients were both higher than those of the controls 
      (both p<0.05). After treatment, sputum and serum miR-144 levels in the TB patients 
      were significantly lower than those measured before treatment (both p<0.05). The 
      levels of sputum and serum miR-144 in the improved TB patients decreased 
      significantly after treatment compared to those measured before treatment (both 
      p<0.001). Significant differences were found in sputum and serum miR-144 levels in 
      the TB patients, with or without improvement, compared with the healthy controls 
      (all p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Sputum and serum miR-144 levels were significantly 
      upregulated in the TB patients, but were found to decrease significantly after 
      anti-TB treatment.

AB  - The current study assessed the diagnostic accuracy of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) and evaluated it as a diagnostic screening aid for avian tuberculosis 
      (TB) in a wildfowl collection at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust Centre at Llanelli, 
      Wales, U.K.. Four hundred and eighteen birds of the collection, including geese, 
      ducks, and swans, were screened for mycobacterial antibody levels. Of those birds 
      tested, 40 died during the period of this study and gross post mortem examinations 
      were performed. The ELISA showed a sensitivity of 76.9% and a specificity of 55.6% 
      using post-mortem findings as the 'gold standard'. Thirteen of the examined birds 
      showed evidence of avian TB at necropsy. In addition, liver and spleen biopsies of 
      19 birds were examined histopathologically. There was minimal agreement between 
      gross post mortem and histopathological findings. PCR performed on 13 of the 
      specimens prepared for histopathology did not identify the presence of mycobacterial 
      DNA. The findings reveal a need for further research to improve the sensitivity and 
      specificity of this ELISA and the accurate diagnosis of avian TB.

TI  - Evidence for a superantigen in human tuberculosis.
PG  - 35-43
AB  - T cells are not only required for resistance to tuberculosis, but they likely 
      contribute to the tissue damage characteristic of the disease. To define better the 
      T cell populations that contribute to the immunopathogenesis of human tuberculosis, 
      we investigated the T cell receptor (TCR) beta chain repertoire expressed in 
      patients with tuberculous pleuritis. Analysis by polymerase chain reaction and flow 
      cytometry indicated an expansion of V beta 8+ T cells at the site of disease in some 
      donors, suggesting the possibility that Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains a 
      superantigen. M. tuberculosis induced strong T cell proliferative responses in 
      tuberculin-negative healthy donors in vitro, with preferential expansion of V beta 
      8+ T cells, independent of the CDR3 region. T cell stimulation was MHC class 
      II-dependent and did not require antigen processing by the antigen-presenting cells. 
      These findings are consistent with the presence of a superantigen in M. 
      tuberculosis, aspects of which may contribute to the immunopathology of tuberculosis 
      and to the adjuvant properties of M. tuberculosis.

AB  - We are leveraging recent advances in rapid nucleic acid amplification chemistries, 
      self-powered microfluidics, and low-cost optoelectronics to develop instrumentation 
      for pathogen genotyping in the developing world. A growing number of correlations 
      are emerging between genetic mutations in pathogens and their infectivity, origin, 
      and drug resistance. Particularly for diseases like tuberculosis, where multi-drug 
      resistance is a growing concern, a rapid diagnostic which could inform prescription 
      decisions for newly diagnosed patients would not only save lives and reduce 
      prolonged sickness but would help slow the emergence of more virulent strains. 
      Additionally, for pathogens such as HIV, there is a need for new assay formats which 
      can inexpensively and quantitativly monitor pathogen load. We have developed a 
      portable instrument which uses disposable microfluidic assay cartridges pre-loaded 
      with lyophilized reagents for genetic amplification of multiple markers. The 
      cartridges can be adapted for a variety of sample types (blood, sputum, saliva). The 
      instrument controls assay temperature and quantitatively monitors real-time 
      fluorescence signals from 96 individual reaction chambers. The platform can be 
      tailored for different economic situations--from a quantitative electronic readout 
      to a simple binary readout with the naked eye.

AB  - The aim of this study was to elucidate the possible association between migration 
      inhibitory factor (MIF)-173G/C gene polymorphisms and transcript and plasma levels 
      of MIF in spinal tuberculosis (TB) patients. Clinical data were collected from 254 
      spinal TB patients and 262 healthy controls participating in the study. The genotype 
      of the MIF-173G/C gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and genotyped by 
      DNA sequencing technology. The level of mRNA expression was determined by real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction and MIF plasma levels were measured by a solid-phase 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The frequency of the C allele and GC+CC genotype 
      in MIF-173G/C was over-represented in spinal TB patients. The mean MIF mRNA level in 
      spinal TB patients and patients with the GG and GC+CC genotype were significantly 
      lower than controls; however, our study also indicated that the MIF concentration in 
      spinal TB patients and patients with the GG and GC+CC genotypes were significantly 
      higher than controls. Spinal TB patients with the GG genotype had higher MIF plasma 
      levels than patients with the GC+CC genotype. The C-reactive protein level and 
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate was correlated with the MIF plasma level. In summary, 
      the association between the MIF-173G/C genetic polymorphism, reduced transcript and 
      increased plasma levels of MIF in spinal TB patients, and MIF may play an important 
      role in the occurrence, development, and damage of spinal TB in the northern 
      Province population of China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) remains a major cause of morbidity and 
      mortality all around the world. Recent studies have pointed out increased oxidative 
      stress and also DNA damage in peripheral blood in PTB. Till date, to the best of our 
      knowledge, no study has so far been conducted to show the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
      deletions mapping in PTB patients. Therefore we performed the present study with the 
      aim to investigate oxidative stress parameters along with mtDNA damage in newly 
      diagnosed untreated PTB patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a prospective study 
      carried out in Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sevagram,Wardha, 
      Maharashtra during september 2017 to september 2018.Thirty newly diagnosed untreated 
      PTB patients and thirty age matched healthy controls were enrolled in the present 
      study. Analysis of Oxidative stress parameters such as nitric oxide (NO) and 
      malondialdehyde (MDA) were done by calorimetric methods. Assessment of mitochondrial 
      DNA damage was carried out by mtDNA deletions mapping using primer shift long range 
      polymerase chain reaction technique. RESULTS: There was significant increase in 
      levels of oxidative stress parameters, nitric oxide and malondialdehyde, in PTB 
      patients compared to controls (p < 0.01). Generally there are two common deletion 
      sites of "13 bp direct repeats" (ACCTCCCTCACCA) in mtDNA. One at the junction sites 
      from bp 8470 to 8482 bp and another from bp 13447 to 13460 bp which make mtDNA more 
      prone for 4977bp deletion. Out of thirty cases of PTB, two cases showed mtDNA damage 
      in the form of mtDNA deletion of 4977bp. There was no mtDNA deletion in any control 
      which can be attributed to continuous generation of oxidative stress. CONCLUSION: 
      This pilot study has been able to demonstrate that compared to controls, in newly 
      diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients some mtDNA damage did occur and was 
      probably due to continuous generation of oxidative stress in tuberculous patients. 
      However, sample size is too small to draw any conclusions but definitely a more 
      comprehensive study, by recruiting more number of pulmonary tuberculosis patients is 
      warranted to establish correlation between oxidative stress and mtDNA damage in PTB.

AB  - Different mycobacterial species are encountered in bovine medicine. The fastidiously 
      growing mycobacteria (Mycobacterium bovis as the cause of bovine tuberculosis, and 
      Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, MAP, as the cause of paratuberculosis) 
      are well known and targeted in eradication/control or monitoring programs in 
      different countries, whereas the rapidly growing species is only rarely identified 
      from bovine disease. The latter have occasionally been reported as the cause of 
      bovine clinical mastitis, but recent reports are scarce. In this study, 
      Mycolicibacterium smegmatis (basonym Mycobacterium smegmatis) was identified as 
      cause of granulomatous, relapsing clinical mastitis in 2 cows from one Belgian dairy 
      herd. Milk, blood, and fecal samples were collected, as well as tissue samples after 
      the cows were culled. Serological analysis conducted on milk and serum samples 
      resulted in positive reactions for MAP, but negative for Mycobacterium bovis. 
      Production of IFN-γ showed sensitization with mycobacteria or similar organisms, 
      other than M. bovis, in one cow. Detection of MAP by bacteriological culture and 
      IS900-based quantitative PCR on milk and feces remained negative. In conclusion, 
      this paper describes M. smegmatis as a cause of bovine clinical mastitis in Belgium 
      and suggests cross-reactivity of the intramammary M. smegmatis infection with 
      routinely used serological tests for MAP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Association of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) and 
      Crohn's disease (CD) has been controversial due to contradictory reports. Therefore, 
      we determined the prevalence of MAP in patients with CD and intestinal tuberculosis 
      (ITB) and its association with clinical course. METHODOLOGY: Blood and intestinal 
      biopsies were taken from 69 CD, 32 ITB patients and 41 patients with haemorrhoidal 
      bleed who served as controls. qPCR targeting of MAP-specific IS900 gene was used to 
      detect the presence of MAP DNA. qPCR results were further validated by sequencing. 
      Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the presence of MAP antigen in biopsy 
      specimens. CD and ITB patients were followed-up for disease course and response to 
      therapy. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The frequency of MAP-specific DNA in biopsies by qPCR 
      was significantly higher in CD patients (23.2%, p = 0.03) as compared to controls 
      (7.3%). No significant difference in intestinal MAP presence was observed between 
      ITB patients (12.5%, p = 0.6) and controls (7.3%). MAP presence in blood of CD 
      patients was 10.1% as compared to 4.9% in controls while no patients with ITB were 
      found to be positive (p = 0.1). Using IHC for detection of MAP antigen, the 
      prevalence of MAP in CD was 2.9%, 12.5% in ITB patients and 2.4% in controls. 
      However, long-term follow-up of the patients revealed no significant associations 
      between clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes with MAP positivity. 
      CONCLUSION: We report significantly high prevalence of MAP in intestinal biopsies of 
      CD patients. However, the presence of MAP does not affect the disease course and 
      treatment outcomes in either CD or ITB patients.

AB  - Procedures for the microbiological diagnosis of acute community-acquired pneumonia 
      are based on the expected pathogens. Although a great variety of microorganisms are 
      able to cause community-acquired pneumonia only a few pathogens play an important 
      role in daily practice. The most important investigations are blood cultures and 
      sputum cultures to detect bacteria like pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae and 
      Staphylococcus aureus as well as antibody tests for Mycoplasma pneumonia and 
      Chlamydia pneumonia. According to anamnesis and clinic presentation tests such as 
      for Legionella or viruses have to be added. Sometimes also rare pathogens have to be 
      considered such as Coxiella burnetii, Leptospira, Hantaviruses, cryptococci or 
      Chlamydia psittaci. The standard procedure for diagnosis of tuberculosis is the 
      microscopical examination and the standardized culture in liquid and on solid media. 
      Amplification methods such as PCR are also useful for a rapid diagnosis. However, 
      the application of amplification procedures alone without culture is not 
      recommended.

AB  - Rapid and efficient methods for the determination of cured pulmonary tuberculosis 
      (TB) are lacking. We screened serum miRNAs using the Solexa sequencing method among 
      untreated TB patients, two-month treated TB patients, cured TB patients, and healthy 
      controls. A total of 100 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in cured TB 
      patients, including 37 up-regulated (fold change >1.50, P < 0.05) and 63 
      down-regulated (fold change <0.60, P < 0.05) miRNAs. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment 
      analysis revealed that most of the predicted genes were present in the nucleus with 
      a strong protein binding function. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
      pathway analysis strongly suggested alterations in the metabolic pathways. Following 
      quantitative real time chain reaction (qRT-PCR), significantly reduced expression 
      levels of miR-21-5p (0.30, P < 0.001), miR-92a-3p (0.63, P < 0.001), and miR-148b-3p 
      (0.17, P < 0.001) were found in the cured TB patients compared with the untreated TB 
      patients, while significantly increased expression levels of miR-21-5p (2.09, 
      P = 0.001), miR-92a-3p (1.40, P = 0.005), and miR-148b-3p (4.80, P = 0.003) were 
      found in the untreated TB patients compared with the healthy controls. And 
      significantly increased level of miR-125a-5p was found between two-month treated TB 
      patients and untreated TB patients (1.81, P = 0.004). We established a cured TB 
      model with 83.96% accuracy by four miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-92a-3p, miR-148b-3p, and 
      miR-125a-5p), and also established a diagnostic model with 70.09% accuracy. Our 
      study provides experimental data for establishing objective indicators of cured TB, 
      and also provides a new experimental basis to understand the pathogenesis and 
      prognosis of TB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is very difficult to prevent pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to the 
      lack of specific and diagnostic markers, which could lead to a high incidence of 
      pulmonary TB. We screened the differentially expressed serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as 
      potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. METHODS: In this study, 
      serum miRNAs were screened using the Solexa sequencing method as the potential 
      biomarkers for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. The stem-loop quantitative 
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was used to verify 
      differentially expressed serum miRNAs. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curve and logistic regression model were used to analyze the sensitivity and 
      specificity of the single miRNA and a combination of miRNAs for diagnosis, 
      respectively. Using the predicted target genes, we constructed the regulatory 
      networks of miRNAs and genes that were related to pulmonary TB. RESULTS: The Solexa 
      sequencing data showed that 91 serum miRNAs were differentially expressed in 
      pulmonary TB patients, compared to healthy controls. Following qRT-PCR confirmation, 
      six serum miRNAs (hsa-miR-378, hsa-miR-483-5p, hsa-miR-22, hsa-miR-29c, hsa-miR-101 
      and hsa-miR-320b) showed significant difference among pulmonary TB patients, healthy 
      controls (P<0.001) and differential diagnosis groups (including patients with 
      pneumonia, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) (P<0.05). The 
      logistic regression analysis of a combination of six serum miRNAs revealed that the 
      sensitivity and the specificity of TB diagnosis were 95.0% and 91.8% respectively. 
      The miRNAs-gene regulatory networks revealed that several miRNAs may regulate some 
      target genes involved in immune pathways and participate in the pathogenesis of 
      pulmonary TB. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that a combination of six serum miRNAs 
      have great potential to serve as non-invasive biomarkers of pulmonary TB.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Early diagnosis and treatment is necessary to prevent HIV-infected 
      infants progressing to AIDS. Antibody testing is not confirmatory before the age of 
      18 months and PCR not widely available in resource-poor settings. We studied the 
      accuracy of CD4(+) T-lymphocyte count, CD4% and CD4/CD8 ratio as surrogate markers 
      of infant HIV infection. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-eight HIV-exposed Indian 
      infants at a median age of 5 months (range 1-18) had DNA PCR and CD4, CD8 counts 
      performed. RESULTS: Fifty five infants tested positive by HIV-1 DNA PCR whereas 203 
      were negative. Median CD4 count, CD4% and CD4/CD8 ratio were significantly lower in 
      DNA PCR+ infants. Overall sensitivity and specificity of CD4/CD8 ratio <1.0 in 
      predicting HIV was 91 and 92% with a negative predicted value (NPV) and positive 
      predicted value (PPV) of 97 and 76%, respectively. CONCLUSION: CD4/CD8 ratio <1.0 is 
      a more sensitive surrogate marker of HIV infection in Indian infants than a CD4 
      count <1500 cells/µl or CD4% <25%.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, M. avium, and M. intracellulare are the most 
      common causes of systemic bacterial infection in AIDS patients. To identify these 
      mycobacterial isolates in primary blood culture broths, we developed a multiple 
      hybridization probe-based real-time PCR assay using the LightCycler system. The 
      primers were designed to amplify a 320-bp fragment of Mycobacterium 16S rRNA genes. 
      Reaction specificity was evaluated using PCR amplification curves along with 
      specific melting temperatures of probes on DNA extracted from 13 Mycobacterium 
      species. In this study, results showed 100% accuracy for the selected bacterial 
      panel. Detection limits were 350, 600, and 650 colony-forming unit (CFU)/ml blood 
      culture broths for M. tuberculosis complex, M. avium, and M. intracellulare, 
      respectively (1 to 2 CFU/reaction). To evaluate clinical applicability, 341 
      acid-fast bacilli in blood culture broths were analyzed. In total, 327 (96%) were 
      positively identified: 54.5% M. tuberculosis complex, 37.5% M. avium, and 3.8% M. 
      intracellulare. Results can be available within 3 hours of receiving a broth sample, 
      which makes this rapid and simple assay an attractive diagnostic tool for clinical 
      use.

AB  - The broad clinical presentation of Leishmaniasis makes the diagnosis of current and 
      past cases of this disease rather difficult. Differential diagnosis is important 
      because diseases caused by other aetiologies and a clinical spectrum similar to that 
      of leishmaniasis (e.g. leprosy, skin cancers and tuberculosis for CL; malaria and 
      schistosomiasis for VL) are often present in endemic areas of endemicity. Presently, 
      a variety of methods have been developed and tested to aid the identification and 
      diagnosis of Leishmania. The advent of the PCR technology has opened new channels 
      for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis in a variety of clinical materials. PCR is a 
      simple, rapid procedure that has been adapted for diagnosis of leishmaniasis. A 
      range of tools is currently available for the diagnosis and identification of 
      leishmaniasis and Leishmania species, respectively. However, none of these 
      diagnostic tools are examined and tested using samples spotted on FTA cards. Three 
      different PCR-based approaches were examined including: kDNA minicircle, Leishmania 
      18S rRNA gene and PCR-RFLP of Intergenic region of ribosomal protein. PCR primers 
      were designed that sit within the coding sequences of genes (relatively well 
      conserved) but which amplify across the intervening intergenic sequence (relatively 
      variable). These were used in PCR-RFLP on reference isolates of 10 of the most 
      important Leishmania species: L. donovani, L. infantum, L. major & L. tropica. 
      Digestion of PCR products with restriction enzymes produced species-specific 
      restriction patterns allowed discrimination of reference isolates. The kDNA 
      minicircle primers are highly sensitive in diagnosis of both bone marrow and skin 
      smears from FTA cards. Leishmania 18S rRNA gene conserved region is sensitive in 
      identification of bone marrow smear but less sensitive in diagnosing skin smears. 
      The intergenic nested PCR-RFLP using P5 & P6 as well as P1 & P2 newly designed 
      primers showed high level of reproducibility and sensitivity. Though, it was less 
      sensitive than kDNA minicircle primers, but easily discriminated between Leishmania 
      species.

TI  - Evaluation of malaria multiplex/nested PCR performance at low parasite densities and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is still a major public health problem in subtropical and 
      tropical regions. The rapid and accurate diagnosis of malaria remains a challenge in 
      most of the endemic areas. The primary objective of the present study was to 
      evaluate the performance of multiplex/nested PCR in detecting Plasmodium falciparum 
      at low parasite densities and mixed infection. METHODS: The study was performed in 
      the Sistan-Baluchestan province of the southeastern Iran, from May 2015 to July 
      2016. A total of 105 patients suspected to malaria infection were enrolled in the 
      study. The obtained DNA products, extracted from the thick/thin films, were analyzed 
      by multiplex/nested PCR using genus-specific primers and compared with light 
      microscopy. RESULTS: 43 samples were confirmed to be infected by microscopic 
      examination. Among 43 microscopically diagnosed P. falciparum cases, 11.4% (12/105) 
      were confirmed by multiplex/nested PCR, 36.2% (38/105) were confirmed as P. vivax, 
      1.9% (2/105) had mixed infections with P. falciparum and P. vivax. Among 
      microscopy-negative samples, 10 samples turned malaria-positive in nPCR. In 
      multiplex/nested PCR, the rate of mixed infections was 8.6% (9/105). When compared 
      to LM, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative 
      predictive value of multiplex/nested PCR were calculated to be 82.8, 91.5, 92.3 and 
      81.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study, we showed that microscopic 
      examination of blood smears does not reliably distinguish Plasmodium species in the 
      case of mixed infections. Therefore, it seems that multiplex/nested PCR is a good 
      candidate for examining the presence of malaria parasites in clinically suspected 
      but microscopically negative cases.

TI  - Papulonecrotic tuberculid in children. A report of eight patients.
PG  - 172-85
AB  - Papulonecrotic tuberculid (PNT), a form of cutaneous tuberculosis (TB), is uncommon 
      in children. We identified eight children (six girls and two boys) with PNT. Their 
      ages ranged from 19 to 139 months (median 47.5 months, mean:64.75 months). Skin 
      lesions had been present for 2-24 weeks (median: 4 weeks) before diagnosis. All 
      patients displayed scattered papulo- and/or pustulonecrotic lesions on the limbs, 
      and the ears were involved in six patients. Lesions healed with varioliform scars. 
      Associated pulmonary TB was present in seven patients. Additional clinical findings 
      included fever (n = 4), hepatomegaly (n = 4), lymphadenopathy (n = 3), phlyctenular 
      conjunctivitis (n = 3), and splenomegaly (n = 2). Histology of eight biopsies showed 
      ulceration (n = 6), dermal necrosis (n = 6) (follicle-centered in two), 
      granulomatous inflammation (n = 6) (palisading granuloma-like in three), superficial 
      and deep infiltrate of lymphocytes (n = 7), erythrocyte extravasation (n = 7), and 
      subepidermal edema (n = 3). Vasculitis was not a feature. A Ziehl-Neelsen stain was 
      negative in all. Glycosaminoglycans were not increased. Immunohistochemistry found a 
      predominance of T lymphocytes, macrophages, a few antigen-presenting cells, and no B 
      lymphocytes, consistent with a type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) performed on deparaffinized tissue identified M. tuberculosis DNA in 
      one biopsy. All patients received combination anti-TB treatment for 6 months. Six 
      patients were compliant and were followed up for 6-30 months. Skin lesions and 
      pulmonary TB healed in all. PNT in children resembles the adult form, but 
      phlyctenular conjunctivitis and associated TB are more common, scrofuloderma and 
      concomitant erythema induratum of Bazin are unusual, and vasculitis is not found. In 
      cases where M. tuberculosis DNA can be confirmed with PCR, papulonecrotic TB is 
      perhaps the more appropriate nomenclature.

TI  - Clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic determinants of mortality in hospitalized 
      patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis: A prospective cohort study.
PG  - e1002840
LID - 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002840 [doi]
LID - e1002840
AB  - BACKGROUND: In high-burden settings, case fatality rates are reported to be between 
      11% and 32% in hospitalized patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, yet the 
      underlying causes of mortality remain poorly characterized. Understanding causes of 
      mortality could inform the development of novel management strategies to improve 
      survival. We aimed to assess clinical and microbiologic determinants of mortality 
      and to characterize the pathophysiological processes underlying death by evaluating 
      host soluble inflammatory mediators and determined the relationship between these 
      mediators and death as well as biomarkers of disseminated tuberculosis. METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: Adult patients with HIV hospitalized with a new diagnosis of 
      HIV-associated tuberculosis were enrolled in Cape Town between 2014 and 2016. 
      Detailed tuberculosis diagnostic testing was performed. Biomarkers of tuberculosis 
      dissemination and host soluble inflammatory mediators at baseline were assessed. Of 
      682 enrolled participants, 576 with tuberculosis (487/576, 84.5% microbiologically 
      confirmed) were included in analyses. The median age was 37 years (IQR = 31-43), 
      51.2% were female, and the patients had advanced HIV with a median cluster of 
      differentiation 4 (CD4) count of 58 cells/L (IQR = 21-120) and a median HIV viral 
      load of 5.1 log10 copies/mL (IQR = 3.3-5.7). Antituberculosis therapy was initiated 
      in 566/576 (98.3%) and 487/576 (84.5%) started therapy within 48 hours of enrolment. 
      Twelve-week mortality was 124/576 (21.5%), with 46/124 (37.1%) deaths occurring 
      within 7 days of enrolment. Clinical and microbiologic determinants of mortality 
      included disseminated tuberculosis (positive urine lipoarabinomannan [LAM], urine 
      Xpert MTB/RIF, or tuberculosis blood culture in 79.6% of deaths versus 60.7% of 
      survivors, p = 0.001), sepsis syndrome (high lactate in 50.8% of deaths versus 28.9% 
      of survivors, p < 0.001), and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (16.9% of deaths 
      versus 7.2% of survivors, p = 0.002). Using non-supervised two-way hierarchical 
      cluster and principal components analyses, we describe an immune profile dominated 
      by mediators of the innate immune system and chemotactic signaling (interleukin-1 
      receptor antagonist [IL-1Ra], IL-6, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta 
      [MIP-1β]/C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 [CCL4], interferon gamma-induced protein-10 
      [IP-10]/C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 [CXCL10], MIP-1 alpha [MIP-1α]/CCL3), which 
      segregated participants who died from those who survived. This immune profile was 
      associated with mortality in a Cox proportional hazards model (adjusted hazard ratio 
      [aHR] = 2.2, 95%CI = 1.9-2.7, p < 0.001) and with detection of biomarkers of 
      disseminated tuberculosis. Clinicians attributing causes of death identified 
      tuberculosis as a cause or one of the major causes of death in 89.5% of cases. We 
      did not perform longitudinal sampling and did not have autopsy-confirmed causes of 
      death. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we did not identify a major contribution from 
      coinfections to these deaths. Disseminated tuberculosis, sepsis syndrome, and 
      rifampicin resistance were associated with mortality. An immune profile dominated by 
      mediators of the innate immune system and chemotactic signaling was associated with 
      both tuberculosis dissemination and mortality. These findings provide 
      pathophysiologic insights into underlying causes of mortality and could be used to 
      inform the development of novel treatment strategies and to develop methods to risk 
      stratify patients to appropriately target novel interventions. Causal relationships 
      cannot be established from this study.

AB  - Objective: The cellular immunity of 5 Mycobacterium tuberculosis recombinant 
      proteins and their compositions was evaluated. Method: A total of 88 fresh venous 
      blood from peripheral heparin anticoagulant population, 42 of which were from 
      tuberculosis patients treated by The Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Center of 
      Changping District, Beijing, and 46 of healthy volunteers were provided by the 
      Infection Diseases of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Healthy 
      volunteers without a history of tuberculosis exposure and any clinical signs and 
      symptoms. Using the Mycobacterium tuberculosis standard strain H37Rv DNA as a 
      template, complete genes of the selected 5 recombinant proteins Rv3874, Rv3875, 
      Rv2031c, Rv1411c and Rv3418c by PCR amplified; 5 recombinant proteins were cloned, 
      expressed and purified as stimulants by genetic recombination and protein 
      purification techniques, and the effector T cell enzyme-linked immunospot assay 
      (ELISPOT) was used to detect cellular immunity in the population. Results: The 
      recombinant proteins Rv3874, Rv3875, Rv2031c, Rv1411c and Rv3418c were successfully 
      cloned, expressed and purified; And the sensitivities were 50.00%, 71.43%, 69.04%, 
      73.81% and 76.19%, and the specificities were 86.96%, 76.09%, 71.74%, 39.13% and 
      36.96%. In addition, the positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area 
      under the curve and Youden index were 52.46% to 77.78%, 62.96% to 74.47%, 0.511 to 
      0.754 and 0.129 to 0.475, respectively. Except for Rv1411c and Rv3418c, the number 
      of spot-forming cell (SFC) detected by Rv3874, Rv3875 and Rv2031c in tuberculosis 
      patients was higher than healthy volunteers, and the differences were statistically 
      significant (P<0.001). Among the 26 compositions composed of 5 recombinant proteins, 
      the sensitivity was 80.95% to 95.24%, and the specificity was 68.89% to 24.44%. As 
      the number of recombinant proteins in the composition increases, the sensitivity 
      gradually increased, but the specificity decreased. Conclusion: The recombinant 
      proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv3874, Rv3875 and Rv2031c have strong 
      ability to stimulate T cells to produce immune response, and have certain 
      antigenicity. The efficacy of Rv1411c and Rv3418c alone as diagnostic antigens is 
      not ideal, and the composition composed of multi-component antigens has certain 
      application value. This article provides experimental evidence for the immune 
      diagnosis of tuberculosis and the preparation of new anti-tuberculosis vaccines.

TI  - CpG7909 adjuvant enhanced immunogenicity efficacy in mice immunized with ESAT6-Ag85A 
      fusion protein, but does not confer significant protection against Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis infection.
PG  - 1203-11
LID - 10.1111/jam.12315 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the ability of CpG7909 adjuvant to enhance 
      immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a subunit vaccine composed of ESAT6-Ag85A 
      fusion protein (Pe685a) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: ELISA 
      was used to detect specific antibody and IFN-γ expression in sera; ELISPOT, to 
      detect IFN-γ expression in splenocytes; MTT assay and FACS, to detect T-lymphocytes 
      proliferation in spleens; and RT-PCR, to detect cytokines expression in lungs of 
      mice after immunization. Bacterial load and histopathological lesions in lungs or 
      spleens of mice challenged with Myco. tuberculosis H37Rv strain were analysed. 
      Compared with incomplete Freund's adjuvant, CpG7909 induced more potent production 
      of Pe685a-specific IgG2a/IgG1 antibody and higher expression of IFN-γ in sera, 
      stimulated more generation of antigen-specific IFN-γ-secreting splenocytes, enhanced 
      frequencies of CD3(+) CD4(+) and CD3(+) CD8(+) T-lymphocytes in spleen and increased 
      transcription of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6 and TLR9 in lung. However, lower bacterial load 
      in lung and less severe lung pathology were not observed in CpG7909 group mice. 
      CONCLUSIONS: CpG7909 is able to enhance immunological effects of Pe685a subunit 
      vaccine, but does not confer significant protective efficacy against Myco. 
      tuberculosis infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: CpG7909 as an adjuvant 
      of subunit vaccine against Myco. tuberculosis is worthy of further investigation.

TI  - Hodgkin's lymphoma and tuberculosis coexistence in cervical lymph nodes.
PG  - 471-5
AB  - We describe the case of a 47-year-old man admitted to the Department of Hematology 
      because of fever, enlarged cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes, 
      hepatosplenomegaly and non-specific lung infiltrations. The histopathological 
      examination of the cervical lymph node revealed Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) NS type I. 
      Clinical evaluation revealed stage IVB according to Ann Arbor classification and the 
      presence of 5 unfavorable prognostic factors according to the International 
      Prognostic Index. Despite BEACOPP chemotherapy (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, 
      cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone), the enlarged lymph 
      nodes, lung infiltrations and fever persisted. Microbiological and serological tests 
      did not lead to the identification of any viral or bacterial pathogens. Bronchoscopy 
      showed chronic inflammation and post-tuberculosis (TB) scars in bronchi without 
      acid-fast bacilli in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in culture and polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) tests. However, the biopsy of the supraclavicular lymph node revealed 
      multiple, caseating and necrotizing granulomatous lesions with scattered 
      Reed-Sternberg (R-S) cells. The auramin staining presented acid-fast bacilli and 
      allowed the diagnosis of productive and caseating TB coexisting with HL. The 4 
      tuberculostatics regimen and ABVD chemotherapy (adriamycin, bleomycin, vincristine, 
      dacarbazine) resulted in a complete clinical response after 3 months of treatment. 
      In conclusion, the association between HL and TB must be considered, especially in 
      countries where the latter is endemic. The diagnosis may be difficult due to 
      similarities in the clinical course, laboratory tests and imaging procedures.

TI  - Role of mannose binding lectin gene variants on its protein levels and macrophage 
      phagocytosis with live Mycobacterium tuberculosis in pulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - 433-7
AB  - Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays an important role in innate immunity. Functional 
      mutant homozygotes of the MBL gene affect the serum MBL levels and have been 
      correlated with disease susceptibility. We have studied the regulatory role of 
      variant MBL genotypes on serum MBL level and macrophage phagocytosis with live 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the lymphoproliferative response to M. tuberculosis 
      culture filtrate antigen in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients (n = 48) and 
      normal healthy subjects (NHS) (n = 58). The total serum MBL level was higher in PTB 
      patients than in NHS (P = 0.0085). Patients and NHS with AA genotype (homozygotes of 
      MBL - common alleles) showed a very high serum MBL level, and those with OO genotype 
      (functional mutant homozygotes of MBL - less frequent alleles) showed a very low MBL 
      level (AA vs. OO: NHS, P = 3.3 x 10(-9); PTB, P = 3.1 x 10(-9)). A significantly 
      lower phagocytosis was observed in NHS with AA genotype than in NHS with AO 
      (heterozygotes) genotype (P = 0.046). In PTB patients, no such difference was 
      observed. A negative correlation of macrophage phagocytosis with MBL level was seen 
      in patients and NHS (P = 0.019). Antigen-induced lymphoproliferative response was 
      significantly decreased in PTB patients with AA genotype as compared with NHS with 
      AA genotype (P = 0.036). The present study suggests that AA genotype with its 
      associated higher serum MBL levels plays a regulatory role in immunity to 
      tuberculosis than functional mutant homozygotes (OO genotype) with its associated 
      lower level of MBL.

TI  - [A case of disseminated BCG infection found during treatment of an infant with 
      Crohn's disease].
PG  - 597-603
AB  - Bloody stools, diarrhea and perianal abscesses were observed from the age of two 
      months infant. The boy received a BCG vaccination at the age of four months. The 
      patient was diagnosed as having Crohn's disease at the age of six months by 
      intestinal endoscopy. Based on the diagnosis, he was treated with nutrition therapy, 
      salazosulfapyridine, and prednisolone. Fever of unknown origin occurred two months 
      after he had taken azathioprine at the age of two years and two months. 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected from a gastric aspirate, and he was 
      diagnosed as having disseminated BCG infection by means of the multiplex PCR method. 
      Chest CT showed miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs on admission. Physical 
      examination revealed enlarged lymphnodes, which were palpable around the neck and 
      groin, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory data were within normal ranges except a slightly 
      increased peripheral white blood cell and serum CRP level. He was treated with 
      rifampicin (15 mg/kg/day), isoniazid (15 mg/kg/day) for 12 months, and streptomycin 
      (25 mg/kg/day) for two months. He became afebrile a week after starting the 
      treatment, and the miliary pulmonary nodules in both lungs had disappeared by 5 
      months after starting the treatment. An abnormality of the NEMO gene, which is the 
      gene responsible for ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency, was identified at 
      the age of three years. It is assumed that an abnormality of the NEMO gene caused a 
      latent BCG infection over a period of one year and ten months, and immunosuppressive 
      medicine (azathioprine) induced a disseminated BCG infection. This case report 
      supports that anti-tuberculosis medicine should be given to prevent disseminated BCG 
      infection if an infant who receive immunosuppressive therapy is found to have an 
      immune deficiency characterized by a mycobacterium infection after BCG vaccination.

TI  - High IL-35 pleural expression in patients with tuberculous pleural effusion.
PG  - 1261-8
LID - 10.12659/MSM.892562 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: IL-35 is a novel anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive cytokine 
      primarily produced by Treg cells, and is involved in inflammatory diseases and 
      autoimmune diseases. However, its roles in tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) remain 
      unknown. We aimed to investigate the potential involvement of IL-35 in TPE. 
      MATERIAL/METHODS: Thirty TPE patients and 20 lung cancer patients with malignant 
      pleural effusion (MPE) were recruited. Samples of pleural effusion (100 mL) were 
      collected after traditional pleurocentesis. Blood was sampled from TPE patients. 
      Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. Proportions of Th1, 
      Th17, and IL-35-producing cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. IL-35 was assessed 
      by real-time RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunofluorescence. An ELISPOT assay was used to 
      assess the effect of IL-35 on pleural effusion mononuclear cells (PEMCs). RESULTS: 
      Proportions of IL-35-producing cells were higher in TPE compared with MPE (49.4±6.0 
      vs. 15.8±5.4%, P<0.001) and blood from TPE patients (49.4±6.0% vs. 16.6±3.1, 
      P<0.001). IL-35, IL-17 and IFN-γ were elevated in TPE compared with MPE (all 
      P<0.01). ELISPOT assay showed that IL-35 reduced the proportion of IFN-γ-producing 
      CD4+ T cells in TPE. IL-35 mRNA expression was higher in TPE compared with MPE 
      (P<0.001). Immunofluorescence showed that IL-35-positive cells were present in 
      pleural tissues from TPE patients. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that there is an 
      imbalance in IL-35 metabolism in TPE. However, further studies are required to 
      assess the exact relationship with the immune system response to tuberculosis. IL-35 
      might play a role in TPE and might be targeted as a treatment for TPE.

TI  - A Case of Generalized, Superinfected Dermatitis and Inguinal Mycobacterium 
      Lymphadenitis - TB or not TB?
PG  - 270-272
AB  - Dear Editor, Eczema is an inflammatory dermatitis mediated by cellular immunity, 
      with an etiology in which environmental, immunological, and genetic factors are 
      involved. Skin inflammation through proinflammatory cytokines creates a favorable 
      environment for microbial antigens and optimal conditions for infection (1). In case 
      of underlying immunosuppression, inflammatory features of dermatitis and 
      superimposed infections are more severe. The presence of minor trauma of the skin in 
      the form of fissures can favor both easier inoculation of some bacterial germs, 
      leading to a dermatitis superinfection, and/or the transcutaneous inoculation of 
      atypical mycobacteria, with a possibility of developing localized types of 
      tuberculous lymphadenitis (TLA). TLA, the localized type of systemic tuberculosis 
      (TB) infection, is the most common form of extra-pulmonary TB in developing 
      countries (2), while lymphadenitis due to atypical mycobacteria is a localized 
      disease, more frequently seen in developed countries (3,4). In tuberculosis, the 
      transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is airborne, while in atypical 
      mycobacterium lymphadenitis transmission can be both airborne or by ingestion or 
      inoculation (5). In both forms of TB, lymphadenopathy evolves towards abscess and 
      presents fibrotic scars or calcifications upon healing (6). A positive diagnosis 
      involves a clinical and epidemiological investigation, a purified protein derivative 
      (PPD) skin test, ultrasound, and CT / MRI of lymph node masses. A lymph node biopsy 
      is used to confirm the diagnosis of TB and PCR, while positive culture confirms the 
      etiology of TB lymphadenitis. The differential diagnosis of TLA is difficult: 
      neoplastic, bacterial, or viral and fungal infections, sarcoidosis, Castleman's 
      disease, drug reactions, etc. (5). TB-induced immunosuppression may favor the 
      development of fungal and bacterial infections, sometimes severe and poorly 
      responsive to treatment. On the other hand, immunosuppressive conditions increase 
      the risk of extra-pulmonary TB (2). A 40-year old woman who had experienced 
      recurrent episodes of dermatitis over the previous 7 years was hospitalized with 
      fever, malaise, and a disseminated erythematous and crusted, exudative, and flexural 
      itching rash (Figure 1). There were fetid, purulent secretions at the conjunctival, 
      auricular, genital, and umbilical areas. The clinical exam also revealed 
      lymphadenopathy syndrome (large, painful submandibular, cervical, and axillar 
      bilateral lymph nodes; an indurated, painful, and adherent left inguinal lymph node 
      of 5-6 cm). Microbial cultures isolated multiple multi-drug-resistant bacteria 
      (SAH-MRSA, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli, Enterobacter) 
      and Candida albicans in the oral cavity and conjunctival, auricular, nasal, 
      umbilical, and genital areas. The skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of dermatitis. 
      PPD skin test was 21 mm. Other tests (HIV and syphilis serology, blood culture, 
      chest X-ray) were negative. Systemic treatment with vancomycin, metronidazole, 
      fluconazole, local antiseptic compresses, and topical corticosteroid ointments was 
      initiated. 2 days after starting the treatment with vancomycin, Redman syndrome 
      occurred (headache, dyspnea, colicky pains, myalgia, rush, fever (39 °C), 
      hypotension (80/40 mmHg), and tachycardia (100 bpm)). This syndrome resolved upon 
      discontinuation of Vancomycin. Further treatment with imipenem/cilastatinand 
      linezolid for 14 days lead to a favorable response with amelioration of the 
      symptoms. Biopsy of the submandibular lymph node raised the suspicion of Castleman's 
      disease; however, due to the overall incomplete clinical picture (no night sweats, 
      no weight reduction, lack of hepatosplenomegaly and peripheral neuropathy), we 
      decided to perform a biopsy of an inguinal lymph node. The histopathological aspect 
      suggested TLA (lymphoid hyperplasia predominantly diffuse, reactive, presenting 
      tuberculous follicles with central caseous necrosis) (Figure 2). A combination of 
      specific antituberculous drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) 
      for 6 months resolved the lymphadenopathy syndrome with no further recurrence of 
      eczema and skin infections. Certain delayed hypersensitivity mechanisms are involved 
      both in dermatitis and in TB. CD4 lymphocytes are the primary mediators of anti-TB 
      immunity, while proinflammatory cytokines mediate the activation of macrophages 
      involved in controlling bacillary growth (1). In cases of superinfected dermatitis, 
      microbial exotoxins penetrate the skin barrier more easily due to inflammation. 
      Released cytokines (IL-1, TNF, and IL12) favor the expression of E-selectin on 
      endothelial vascular growth factor and on skin lymphocyte antigen expression, with 
      amplification of initial skin inflammation and creating favorable conditions for 
      microbial colonization and infection (7). The common denominator in dermatitis and 
      TB are the circulating immune complexes (up to 56% of TB cases), which are formed by 
      the interaction between an antibody and bacterial antigen (8), which was in this 
      case evidenced by increased levels of IgA and IgG. In our case, the frequent 
      recurrences of infected dermatitis with multiple multi-drug-resistant germs that 
      were poorly responsive to treatment and displayed a severe evolution towards 
      generalization as well as the lymphadenopathy and the persistence of a biological 
      inflammatory syndrome indicated that another immunosuppressive cause could be 
      involved. Isolated bacterial and fungal germs changed the immune status of the 
      patient. The risk of mycobacterium infection was increased by the environment they 
      created and the patient's underlying skin inflammation. The diagnosis of TB 
      lymphadenitis was established by the histopathologist, but in the absence of PCR we 
      could not determine whether the TB infection was caused by Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis or by atypical mycobacteria. Given that there was no evidence of other 
      sites of TB infection, we conjectured that inoculation of mycobacterium took place 
      at the skin lesion and that an atypical mycobacterium might have contributed to the 
      etiology of the TLA. In our case, the anti-tuberculous drugs and skin infection 
      treatment with follow-up of the side-effects led to complete remission of 
      mycobacterium lymphadenitis, dermatitis, and infectious processes, without relapses. 
      In conclusion, in the present case chronic dermatitis alongside infection with 
      multi-drug-resistant germs led to an immunosuppressive status which, when associated 
      with the presence of multiple skin ports of entry, allowed a mycobacterial infection 
      at the inguinal lymph node level. Inguinal TLA induced severe dermatitis and 
      difficulties in diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - The epidemic of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug-resistance 
      tuberculosis (MDR-TB) presented a major challenge for TB treatment today. We 
      performed iTRAQ labeling coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem 
      mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) and Solexa sequencing among MDR-TB patients, 
      drug-sensitive tuberculosis (DS-TB) patients, and healthy controls. A total of 50 
      differentially expressed proteins and 43 differentially expressed miRNAs (fold 
      change >1.50 or <0.60, P<0.05) were identified in the MDR-TB patients compared to 
      both DS-TB patients and healthy controls. We found that 22.00% of differentially 
      expressed proteins and 32.56% of differentially expressed miRNAs were related, and 
      could construct a network mainly in complement and coagulation cascades. Significant 
      differences in CD44 antigen (CD44), coagulation factor XI (F11), kininogen-1 (KNG1), 
      miR-4433b-5p, miR-424-5p, and miR-199b-5p were found among MDR-TB patients, DS-TB 
      patients and healthy controls (P<0.05) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
      and SYBR green qRT-PCR validation. A strong negative correlation, consistent with 
      the target gene prediction, was found between miR-199b-5p and KNG1 (r=-0.232, 
      P=0.017). Moreover, we established the MDR-TB diagnostic model based on five 
      biomarkers (CD44, KNG1, miR-4433b-5p, miR-424-5p, and miR-199b-5p). Our study 
      proposes potential biomarkers for MDR-TB diagnosis, and also provides a new 
      experimental basis to understand the pathogenesis of MDR-TB.

PG  - 59-68
AB  - Bovine purified protein derivative (PPD)-induced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and 
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) mRNA expression was measured in peripheral blood lymphocyte 
      cultures of cattle inoculated with Mycobacterium bovis and compared to cytokine 
      protein levels as measured by IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and IL-2 
      bioassay. For individual animals, positive correlations were observed between mRNA 
      and protein levels of bovine PPD-induced IFN-gamma and IL-2, although the 
      correlations were stronger for IFN-gamma. Expression of these two cytokines also 
      correlated with responses from a comparative intradermal test and a M. bovis 
      antibody test. At 7 and 20 weeks after inoculation, bovine PPD-induced IFN-gamma and 
      IL-2 mRNA expression was detected in all animals with tuberculous lesions and in a 
      proportion of the M. bovis-inoculated animals with no lesions. Correlation of 
      antigen-induced IFN-gamma and IL-2 with other immune parameters suggests that these 
      two cytokines play an important role in the immune response to bovine tuberculosis.

TI  - [Pulmonary mycobacterium intracellulare infection complicated with pneumothorax and 
      chronic empyema].
PG  - 795-7
AB  - A 75-year-old woman who had been treated for pulmonary Mycobacterium intracellulare 
      infection was admitted to a nearby hospital because of hemoptysis, right 
      pneumothorax, and empyema. She had been treated by thoracic drainage and pleural 
      lavage, but was reffered to our hospital because of refractory empyema. Her chest 
      radiograph and chest computed tomography( CT) showed right chronic empyema of which 
      pleural aspirate was smear positive for acid-fast bacilli and positive for the 
      polymerase chain reaction method(PCR)-Mycobacterium intracellulare. Serum levels of 
      white blood cell and C-reactive protein(CRP) were found to be slightly elevated. She 
      was treated with combined use of ethambutol, rifampicin, clarithromycin, and 
      kanamycin and with pleural curettage by thoracoscopic surgery. After surgery 
      additional treatment was done using urokinase which was administered into the 
      thoracic cavity via an thoracic tube. Chronic empyema gradually improved with the 
      treatment and the pleural effusion became bacterial free, enabling the patient to 
      discharge from hospital without thoracic drainage.

TI  - Relevance of nucleic acid amplification techniques for diagnosis of respiratory 
      tract infections in the clinical laboratory.
PG  - 242-56
AB  - Clinical laboratories are increasingly receiving requests to perform nucleic acid 
      amplification tests for the detection of a wide variety of infectious agents. In 
      this paper, the efficiency of nucleic acid amplification techniques for the 
      diagnosis of respiratory tract infections is reviewed. In general, these techniques 
      should be applied only for the detection of microorganisms for which available 
      diagnostic techniques are markedly insensitive or nonexistent or when turnaround 
      times for existing tests (e.g., viral culture) are much longer than those expected 
      with amplification. This is the case for rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and 
      hantaviruses causing a pulmonary syndrome, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia 
      pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Coxiella burnetii. For Legionella spp. and 
      fungi, contamination originating from the environment is a limiting factor in 
      interpretation of results, as is the difficulty in differentiating colonization and 
      infection. Detection of these agents in urine or blood by amplification techniques 
      remains to be evaluated. In the clinical setting, there is no need for molecular 
      diagnostic tests for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii. At present, 
      amplification methods for Mycobacterium tuberculosis cannot replace the classical 
      diagnostic techniques, due to their lack of sensitivity and the absence of specific 
      internal controls for the detection of inhibitors of the reaction. Also, the results 
      of interlaboratory comparisons are unsatisfactory. Furthermore, isolates are needed 
      for susceptibility studies. Additional work remains to be done on sample preparation 
      methods, comparison between different amplification methods, and analysis of 
      results. The techniques can be useful for the rapid identification of M. 
      tuberculosis in particular circumstances, as well as the rapid detection of most 
      rifampin-resistant isolates. The introduction of diagnostic amplification techniques 
      into a clinical laboratory implies a level of proficiency for excluding 
      false-positive and false-negative results.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Variability in clinical outcome of tuberculosis infection is 
      dependent, among other factors, on variation in host immunological response to the 
      infection, which is modulated, in part by genetic variations present in the host. We 
      undertook a study to identify host factors associated with such clinical 
      variability. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A comparative study between groups of active 
      TB patients vs. clinically normal household contacts, family members living under 
      the same roof with the patients for a long period of time, was carried out. We 
      screened 22 candidate cytokines and chemokines in the plasma of 119 pairs 
      ("discovery set") of TB patients and their asymptomatic household contacts. 
      Identified associations were validated in an independent cohort of 78 
      patient-household contact pairs ("validation set"). Validated associations were 
      further cross-validated by gene expression assays using RT-PCR and in-vitro whole 
      blood stimulation by mycobacterial antigens ESAT6 and Rv2031c, two 
      well-characterized antigens that are expressed in active and latent phases of 
      disease, respectively. In a concomitant SNP association study, we have sequenced the 
      validated gene in these patients and household contacts. RESULT: CXCL10 was found to 
      be the most significantly (p = 0.0002) elevated chemokine - discovered and validated 
      -- in patients' plasma compared to their household contacts. We found that CXCL10 
      was overexpressed by 5-fold at the RNA level in patients compared to asymptomatic 
      household contacts (p = 0.004). On stimulation of whole blood collected from normal 
      healthy volunteers with mycobacterial antigens ESAT6 and Rv2031c, we found that 
      production of CXCL10 by ESAT6 was significantly higher (p = 2.8 × 10(-12)) than 
      Rv2031c. The production of CXCL10 was 20-fold more than IFN-γ, the most widely 
      validated cytokine, by ESAT6 stimulation (p = 4.6 × 10(-8)). One of the 
      polymorphisms in promoter of CXCL10, rs4508917 (-1447 A > G), was identified as a 
      proteinQTL (pQTL). Reduced expression of CXCL10 was observed among individuals with 
      GG genotype, but the reduction was statistically significant only among controls, 
      but not among patients. Among patients, the expression level was very high compared 
      to the controls irrespective of the genotypes at this locus. CONCLUSION: Plasma 
      level of CXCL10 is predictive of the active phase of TB infection.

TI  - Detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in sarcoidosis: correlation with T-cell response.
PG  - 775-84
AB  - The pathogenetic role of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in 
      tuberculosis is well defined, whereas its role in sarcoidosis is controversial. In 
      sarcoidosis, activation of T-helper cells is observed, which is comparable to 
      tuberculosis. The aim of this study was first to investigate whether M. tuberculosis 
      DNA could be retrospectively detected in samples of patients with clinically 
      verified sarcoidosis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and second, to analyze the 
      relationship between M. tuberculosis DNA positive samples and T-cell response in 
      sarcoidosis patients. Formalin fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissues or cell 
      sediments of bronchoalveolar lavage, respectively, from 65 patients with sarcoidosis 
      and lung tissues from 40 tuberculosis patients were investigated by means of 
      different PCR assays in comparison to control samples. The primers used were derived 
      from insertion sequence IS 986/6110 specific for the M. tuberculosis complex (123 bp 
      PCR) and from the gene encoding the 38 kDa protein antigen b (419 bp PCR). The 123 
      bp assay yielded a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity of 95%. In contrast, the 419 
      bp PCR method showed a lower sensitivity of only 8% likely because of possible DNA 
      degradation during fixation and embedding procedures of the tissue and the fact that 
      this PCR uses a single copy element as target. We amplified the M. tuberculosis 
      complex specific 123 bp fragment in 64% of samples from sarcoidosis patients. The 
      specificity of PCR products in these cases was confirmed by DNA sequencing. 
      Interestingly in the M. tuberculosis positive sarcoidoses, we found increased serum 
      levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor in correlation to the sarcoidosis stages (p 
      < 0.05). In conclusion, the determination of M. tuberculosis by PCR alone does not 
      permit a differentiation between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. However these results 
      support the contention that M. tuberculosis may play a pathogenetic role at least in 
      the part of sarcoidosis patients with elevated interleukin-2 receptor values.

AB  - This study aimed at developing and assessing the fusion proteins with enhanced 
      sensitivity to detect antibodies in plasma as a diagnostic method for tuberculosis. 
      DNA fragments encoding TB16.3 and echA1 gene regions corresponding to proteins 
      TB16.3 and echA1 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis were amplified through PCR. Through 
      a series of restrictions and ligations two novel fusion constructs TB16.3-echA1 and 
      TB16.3-tnPstS1 were produced and expressed in Escherichia coli. These were screened 
      for detection of antibodies in human plasma. The individual antigens TB16.3, echA1 
      and tnPstS1 and the fusion protein TB16.3-tnPstS1 and TB16.3-echA1 showed 
      sensitivities of 29%, 25.5%, 42.8%, 40.0% and 47.2%, respectively. Lower sensitivity 
      in case of TB16.3-tnPstS1 seems to be due to the structural arrangement between the 
      two proteins, which is likely to mask several of their epitopes. The higher 
      sensitivity of TB16.3-echA1 appears to be due to lesser interaction between the two 
      proteins thus allowing free availability of epitopes for binding antibodies. 64% of 
      TB patients were found positive for either one of the two fusion proteins 
      TB16.3-echA1 and TB16.3-tnPstS1. This study indicates that the novel fusion protein 
      TB16.3-echA1 has a potential in serodiagnosis of TB with improved sensitivity and 
      reliability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone, express, and characterize Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) 
      ClpP2, and evaluated the potential usage of ClpP2 in clinical diagnosis of 
      tuberculosis. METHODS: Mtb ClpP2 was cloned into recombinant plasmid pET32a (+) and 
      transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were 
      performed to detect the expression of the recombinant protein. The immunogenicity of 
      Mtb ClpP2 was assessed with epitope prediction and antibody titer assay. 
      Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the influence of stress 
      conditions on ClpP2 expression. ClpP2 antigen and antibody in patients with 
      pulmonary diseases were detected by indirect ELISA. ROC curve was constructed to 
      assess the diagnostic accuracy of Mtb ClpP2 for tuberculosis. RESULTS: We had cloned 
      and expressed recombinant Mtb ClpP2 in E. coli. Our results showed that Mtb ClpP2 
      had potent immunogenicity, and our own prepared polyclonal antibody could be used in 
      detection and diagnostic tests. Results from Western blot showed that ClpP2 was 
      mainly located in M. bovis BCG cytoplasm, and real-time PCR indicated that stress 
      conditions could enhance the mRNA expression of ClpP2. Indirect ELISA suggested 
      that, in tuberculosis patients, both the levels of ClpP2 antigen and antibody were 
      increased, and the positive rates of ClpP2 were elevated. ROC curve had demonstrated 
      satisfactory sensitivity and specificity of ClpP2-based diagnosis for tuberculosis. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Mtb ClpP2 antigens would be used as a biomarker 
      in tuberculosis pathogenesis. These findings highlight the feasibility of the 
      application of Mtb ClpP2 in the clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis.

AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers a sensitive and specific way of detecting 
      microbial DNA in clinical samples. The aims of the present study were to develop an 
      assay, based on a single-tube, nested PCR, for identifying Brucella in samples of 
      human blood and then to explore the use of this test in diagnosis. The primers 
      chosen were derived from IS711, the insertion sequence gene found in all species of 
      Brucella. The assay amplified a 52-bp final product which was detected 
      colorimetrically. The PCR was sensitive and specific, giving positive reactions with 
      14 strains of Brucella from five species. The lower limit of detection in vitro was 
      30 organisms. There were no false-positive reactions either with a range of bacteria 
      known to evoke serological cross-reactions with Brucella (Vibrio cholerae, Yersinia 
      enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      and Escherichia coli K12) or with organisms producing similar clinical syndromes 
      (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella typhi). The results of a preliminary 
      field trial of the assay in Kuwait indicate that the assay may be a valuable 
      technique in the diagnosis of human brucellosis, meriting further study with larger 
      numbers of cases. All 28 subjects with brucellosis (diagnosed on the basis of 
      typical clinical features and confirmed by positive serology and, in three cases, by 
      positive blood cultures) were PCR-positive whereas 28 healthy controls and 28 
      patients with febrile illness attributable to infections other than brucellosis were 
      PCR-negative.

AB  - Pleural tuberculosis (TB), together with lymphatic TB, constitutes more than half of 
      all extrapulmonary cases. Pleural effusions (PEs) in TB are representative of 
      lymphocytic PEs which are dominated by T cells. However, the mechanism underlying T 
      lymphocytes homing and accumulation in PEs is still incompletely understood. Here we 
      performed a comparative analysis of cytokine abundance in PEs from TB patients and 
      non-TB patients by protein array analysis and observed that MCP-2/CCL8 is highly 
      expressed in the TB-PEs as compared to peripheral blood. Meanwhile, we observed that 
      CCR5, the primary receptor used by MCP-2/CCL8, is mostly expressed on pleural CD4(+) 
      T lymphocytes. Furthermore, we found that infection with either Mycobacterium bovis 
      Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv induced 
      production of MCP-2/CCL8 at both transcriptional and protein level in Raw264.7 and 
      THP-1 macrophage cells, mouse peritoneal macrophages as well as human PBMC 
      monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). The induction of MCP-2/CCL8 by mycobacteria is 
      dependent on the activation of TLR2/PI3K/Akt and p38 signaling pathway. We conclude 
      that accumulation of MCP-2/CCL8 in TB-PEs may function as a biomarker for TB 
      diagnosis.

AB  - Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) already established as an immune-modulator in 
      mycobacterial infections generates immune response by acting on CXC chemokines. In 
      the present study, the immunomodulatory effect of MIP in conjunction with 
      chemotherapy against M.tb infection was evaluated by colony forming units (CFUs) 
      following aerosol infection to guinea pig and by measuring CXCL12 chemokine 
      expression using q-PCR and in situ RT-PCR. Different experimental groups included, 
      infection (Rv), immunoprophylaxis (RvMw), chemotherapy (RvCh) and combination of 
      immunoprophylaxis+chemotherapy (RvChMw) group and normal healthy (NH) group. In the 
      combination of immunoprophylaxis+chemotherapy (RvChMw) group, the CFU counts reduced 
      significantly (p<0.001) at 4th week of infection as compared to other treated groups 
      (RvMw and RvCh group). The expression of CXCL12 was recorded in all the treated 
      groups of animals. The study demonstrated suppressed expression of CXCL 12 in both 
      immunoprophylaxis as well as chemotherapy groups (6th and 8th week) that become 
      elevated in immunoprophylaxis plus chemotherapy group (10th week), at which time 
      point no CFUs were detected in RvCh and RvChMw group. The findings indicate that the 
      expression of CXCL12 is associated with good response to anti - tubercular 
      treatment. Thus, prior immunization with MIP appears to show good immunomodulatory 
      effect to release CXCL12 chemokine during infection and also correlates with 
      enhanced effect to chemotherapy.

AB  - This study identified urinary biomarkers for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis. The urine 
      proteomic profiles of 45 pulmonary tuberculosis patients prior to anti-TB treatment 
      and 45 healthy controls were analyzed and compared using two-dimensional 
      electrophoresis with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass 
      spectrometry. Nineteen differentially expressed proteins were identified 
      preliminarily, and western blotting and qRT-PCR were performed to confirm these 
      changes at the translational and transcriptional levels, respectively, using samples 
      from 122 additional pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 73 additional healthy 
      controls. Two proteins, mannose-binding lectin 2 and a 35-kDa fragment of 
      inter-α-trypsin inhibitor H4, exhibited the highest differential expression. We 
      constructed a protein-microRNA interaction network that primarily involved 
      complement and inflammatory responses. Eleven microRNAs from microRNA-target protein 
      interactions were screened and validated using qRT-PCR with some of the above 
      samples, including 97 pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 48 healthy controls. Only 
      miR-625-3p exhibited significant differential expression (p < 0.05). miR-625-3p was 
      increased to a greater extent in samples of smear-positive than smear-negative 
      patients. miR-625-3p was predicted to target mannose-binding lectin 2 protein. A 
      binary logistic regression model based on miR-625-3p, mannose-binding lectin 2, and 
      inter-α-trypsin inhibitor H4 was further established. This three-biomarker 
      combination exhibited better performance for tuberculosis diagnosis than individual 
      biomarkers or any two-biomarker combination and generated a diagnostic sensitivity 
      of 85.87% and a specificity of 87.50%. These novel urine biomarkers may 
      significantly improve tuberculosis diagnosis.

PG  - 141-7
AB  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) which is a severe demyelinating 
      disease of the central nervous system (CNS), is caused by a human polyomavirus known 
      as JC virus (JCV). PML is seen primarily in immunosuppressed (AIDS, organ transplant 
      or malignancy) patients. In this report, a case of PML that developed in a 
      75-years-old female patient with no known immunosuppression was presented. The 
      patient was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of headache and 
      burning sensation in head. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed increase 
      in lymphocytic cells. Since lesions compatible with tuberculoma were detected in 
      brain tissue by magnetic resonance imaging, antituberculous therapy initiated 
      empirically. The disease exhibited a progressive course and all the serological, 
      molecular, microbiological and biochemical tests performed in blood and CSF failed 
      to identify the causative agent. Pathological and immunohistochemical examination of 
      the brain biopsy specimens demonstrated demyelinating disease. Brain biopsy, CSF, 
      serum and urine specimens were investigated by real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      specific for JCV and JCV-DNA was detected in the urine samples. Follow-up visits of 
      the patient indicated a progressive course. In conclusion, after ruling out the 
      other primary causes, JCV should be investigated in patients with demyelinating CNS 
      disease even in the absence of significant immunosuppressive condition. Elderly 
      patients should be considered in the risk group for demyelinating disease of CNS due 
      to JCV.

TI  - Association of tumor necrosis factor-α gene polymorphism with osteoarticular 
      tuberculosis prognosis in a Hebei population.
LID - 10.4238/gmr15048937 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the association of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-308, 
      -238, and -863 polymorphisms with osteoarticular tuberculosis (OA-TB) prognosis in a 
      Hebei population. Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood samples of 120 OA-TB 
      patients and 100 healthy volunteers. TNF-α-308, -238, and -863 were analyzed by 
      PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism; genotype and allele frequencies were 
      calculated. Serum TNF-α level was significantly higher in OA-TB patients (283.16 ± 
      51.68 ng/L) than in control (122.54 ± 54.65 ng/L; P < 0.05). Higher frequency of 
      TNF-α-308 GG genotype in healthy volunteers (91.0%) than in OA-TB patients (79.2%) 
      indicated that it was a protective factor against OA-TB (OR = 0.405, 95%CI = 
      0.147-0.657, P = 0.007). Higher frequencies of TNF-α-308 GA genotype and TNF-α-308 
      allele (A) in OA-TB patients (20.8 and 10.4%, respectively) than in healthy 
      volunteers (8.0 and 5.0%, respectively) indicated an association with increased risk 
      of OA-TB (OR = 3.112, 95%CI = 1.520-6.343, P = 0.003; OR = 3.109, 95%CI = 
      1.676-6.538, P = 0.006; respectively). Haplotype association analysis of TNF-α 
      polymorphisms (-308/-238/-863) showed a higher frequency of TNF-α AGA in OA-TB 
      patients (12.1%) than in healthy volunteers (3.5%), indicating that it was a risk 
      factor for OA-TB (OR = 4.201, 95%CI = 1.80-9.91, P = 0.010). TNF-α-308 G/A and TNF-α 
      AGA (-308/-238/-863) were associated with a predisposition to OA-TB, which could aid 
      clinical detection, prevention, and prognosis of OA-TB.

TI  - Blood transcriptomic markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis load in sputum.
PG  - 950-958
LID - 10.5588/ijtld.17.0855 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral blood transcriptome signatures that distinguish active 
      pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) from control groups have been reported, but correlations 
      of these signatures with sputum mycobacterial load are incompletely defined. 
      METHODS: We assessed the performance of published TB transcriptomic signatures in 
      Haiti, and identified transcriptomic biomarkers of TB bacterial load in sputum as 
      measured by Xpert® MTB/RIF molecular testing. People in Port au Prince, Haiti, with 
      untreated pulmonary TB (n = 51) formed the study cohort: 19 people with low and 32 
      with high sputum Mycobacterium tuberculosis load. Peripheral whole blood 
      transcriptomes were generated using RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Twenty of the 
      differentially expressed transcripts in TB vs. no TB were differentially expressed 
      in people with low vs. high sputum mycobacterial loads. The difference between low 
      and high bacterial load groups was independent of radiographic severity. In a 
      published data set of transcriptomic response to anti-tuberculosis treatment, this 
      20-gene subset was more treatment-responsive at 6 months than the full active TB 
      signature. CONCLUSION: We identified genes whose transcript levels in the blood 
      distinguish active TB with high vs. low M. tuberculosis loads in the sputum. These 
      transcripts may reveal mechanisms of mycobacterial control of M. tuberculosis during 
      active infection, as well as identifying potential biomarkers for bacterial response 
      to anti-tuberculosis treatment.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the roles of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and 
      nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in immune response to spinal tuberculosis in a New 
      Zealand white rabbit model. Forty-eight New Zealand white rabbits were collected and 
      divided into four groups: experimental group (n=30, spinal tuberculosis model was 
      established), the sham group (n=15, sham operation was performed) and the blank 
      group (n=3). The qRT-PCR assay and western blotting were applied to detect the mRNA 
      and protein expressions of MCP-1 and NF-κB in peripheral blood. ELISA was used to 
      measure serum levels of MCP-1, NF-κB, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10. Flow cytometry 
      was adopted to assess the distributions of CD4+, CD8+ lymphocytes and CD4+ CD25+ 
      Foxp3 lymphocyte subsets. Compared with the sham and blank groups, the mRNA and 
      protein expressions of MCP-1 and NF-κB in the experimental group were significantly 
      increased. The experimental group had lower serum levels of IL-2 and IFN-γ and 
      higher serum level of IL-10 than the sham and blank groups. In comparison to the 
      sham and blank groups, CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets percentage, CD4+/CD8+ ratio and 
      CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Tregs subsets accounting for CD4+ lymphocyte in the experimental 
      group were lower, while percentage of CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets was higher. Our 
      study provided evidence that higher expression of MCP-1 and NF-κB may be associated 
      with decreased immune function of spinal tuberculosis, which can provide a new 
      treatment direction for spinal tuberculosis.

AB  - Genetic variations in chemokine genes influence the chemoattractive properties of T 
      cells which may be associated with outcome of infections. In present study, we have 
      investigated the regulatory role played by In1.1T/C (rs2280789) polymorphism of CCL5 
      and -135G/A (rs56061981) polymorphism of CXCL10 gene on intracellular CCL5 and 
      CXCL10 expression in T cells. Whole blood cell cultures were stimulated with culture 
      filtrate antigen (CFA) and infected with live M. tuberculosis were used for 
      intracellular CCL5 and CXCL10 expression using flow cytometry. Genotyping was 
      performed using polymerase chain reaction based restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Significantly higher expression of CCL5 expressing CD3+ and 
      CD3+ CD8+ T cells were observed in HCs with In1.1TT genotype compared to C allele 
      carrier (TT+TC) under unstimulated and CFA induced cultures (p<0.05). In -135G/A 
      (rs56061981) polymorphism, PTB patients with GG genotype showed a significantly 
      decreased expression of CD3+ CXCL10+ and CD3+ CD4+ CXCL10+ T cells compared to A 
      allele carrier (GA+AA) under unstimulated, CFA induced and M. tuberculosis infected 
      cultures (P<0.05). The present study suggest that TT genotype of CCL5 In1.1T/C 
      (rs2280789) polymorphism play an important role to increased CCL5 expression in T 
      cell which may enhanced Th1 immunity and help in protection against tuberculosis. 
      The study also suggests GG genotype of CXCL10 -135G/A (rs56061981) polymorphism 
      decreased CXCL10 expression in T cells which may have defective recruitment of 
      mononuclear cells at the site of infection as well granuloma formation and in turn 
      contribute to progression of TB.

AB  - Pleural tuberculosis (TB) remains a common presentation of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (MTB) infection in HIV/TB dually infected subjects, and both cellular 
      and acellular components of the pleural milieu promote HIV-1 replication; however, 
      they remain uncharacterized. Using cytokine array of pleural fluid and real-time 
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunophenotype 
      analysis, pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) were compared to systemic 
      counterparts [i.e. plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)]. 
      Significant increases in pleural fluid cytokines compared to plasma were limited to 
      interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, interferon (IFN)-γ and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, 
      and did not include other T helper type 1 (Th1) (IL-2, IL-15), Th2 or Th17 
      cytokines. Patterns and levels of cytokines were indistinguishable between pleural 
      fluid from HIV/TB and TB patients. Forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) mRNA in PFMC was 
      increased significantly and correlated highly with levels of IL-6 and IL-8, less 
      with TGF-β, and not with IFN-γ. Among CD4 T cells, FoxP3-reactive CD25(hi) were 
      increased in HIV/TB dually infected subjects compared to their PBMC, and up to 15% 
      of FoxP3(+) CD25(hi) CD4 T cells were positive for IL-8 by intracellular staining. 
      These data implicate a dominant effect of MTB infection (compared to HIV-1) at 
      pleural sites of dual HIV/TB infection on the local infectious milieu, that include 
      IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ and TGF-β and regulatory T cells (T(reg) ). A correlation in 
      expansion of T(reg) with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IL-8) in pleural fluid 
      was shown. T(reg) themselves may promote the inflammatory cytokine milieu through 
      IL-8.

TI  - Down-regulation of Notch signaling pathway reverses the Th1/Th2 imbalance in 
      tuberculosis patients.

AB  - Th1/Th2 imbalance to Th2 is of significance in the peripheral immune responses in 
      Tuberculosis (TB) development. However, the mechanisms for Th1/Th2 imbalance are 
      still not well determined. Notch signaling pathway is involved in the peripheral T 
      cell activation and effector cell differentiation. However, whether it affects 
      Th1/Th2 imbalance in TB patients is still not known. Here, we used γ-secretase 
      inhibitor (DAPT) to treat the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 
      healthy people or individuals with latent or active TB infection in vitro, 
      respectively. Then, the Th1/Th2 ratios were determined by flow cytometry, and 
      cytokines of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10 in the culture supernatant were measured by CBA 
      method. The Notch signal pathway associated proteins Hes1, GATA3 and T-bet were 
      quantitated by real-time PCR or immunoblotting. Our results showed that DAPT 
      effectively inhibited the protein level of Hes1. In TB patients, the Th2 ratio 
      increased in the PBMCs, alone with the high expression of GATA3 and IL-4, resulting 
      in the high ratios of Th2/Th1 and GATA3/T-bet in TB patients. However, Th2 cells 
      ratio decreased after blocking the Notch signaling pathway by DAPT and the Th2/Th1 
      ratio in TB patients were DAPT dose-dependent, accompanied by the decrease of IL-4 
      and GATA3. But, its influence on Th1 ratio and Th1 related T-bet and IFN-γ levels 
      were not significant. In conclusion, our results suggest that blocking Notch 
      signaling by DAPT could inhibit Th2 responses and restore Th1/Th2 imbalance in TB 
      patients.

TI  - Comparison of a clinical prediction rule and a LAM antigen-detection assay for the

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) in resource poor 
      TB endemic environments is challenging. The accuracy of current tools for the rapid 
      diagnosis of TBM is suboptimal. We sought to develop a clinical-prediction rule for 
      the diagnosis of TBM in a high HIV prevalence setting, and to compare performance 
      outcomes to conventional diagnostic modalities and a novel lipoarabinomannan (LAM) 
      antigen detection test (Clearview-TB®) using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). METHODS: 
      Patients with suspected TBM were classified as definite-TBM (CSF culture or PCR 
      positive), probable-TBM and non-TBM. RESULTS: Of the 150 patients, 84% were 
      HIV-infected (median [IQR] CD4 count = 132 [54; 241] cells/µl). There were 39, 55 
      and 54 patients in the definite, probable and non-TBM groups, respectively. The LAM 
      sensitivity and specificity (95%CI) was 31% (17;48) and 94% (85;99), respectively 
      (cut-point ≥ 0.18). By contrast, smear-microscopy was 100% specific but detected 
      none of the definite-TBM cases. LAM positivity was associated with HIV co-infection 
      and low CD4 T cell count (CD4<200 vs. >200 cells/µl; p = 0.03). The sensitivity and 
      specificity in those with a CD4<100 cells/µl was 50% (27;73) and 95% (74;99), 
      respectively. A clinical-prediction rule ≥ 6 derived from multivariate analysis had 
      a sensitivity and specificity (95%CI) of 47% (31;64) and 98% (90;100), respectively. 
      When LAM was combined with the clinical-prediction-rule, the sensitivity increased 
      significantly (p<0.001) to 63% (47;68) and specificity remained high at 93% (82;98). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite its modest sensitivity the LAM ELISA is an accurate rapid 
      rule-in test for TBM that has incremental value over smear-microscopy. The rule-in 
      value of LAM can be further increased by combination with a clinical-prediction 
      rule, thus enhancing the rapid diagnosis of TBM in HIV-infected persons with 
      advanced immunosuppression.

AB  - PCR is the most sensitive molecular diagnostic available for infectious diseases. 
      The goal for low-resource settings is a simple, inexpensive instrument. Toward this 
      goal, we previously published a self-contained sample preparation instrument that 
      uses magnetics and prearrayed reagents in thin tubing to extract nucleic acids and 
      perform isothermal amplification and detection of extracted biomarkers. To 
      incorporate PCR thermal cycling, after biomarker is magnetically extracted from a 
      patient sample, the section of tubing containing the extracted biomarker and PCR 
      reagents is alternately positioned within two constant temperature blocks. This 
      instrument was evaluated initially by extracting and amplifying a 140 bp fragment of 
      the IS6110 sequence of tuberculosis from TE buffer. The mean cycle threshold for 5 × 
      10(6) copies of IS6110 was 25.5 ± 1.5 cycles (n = 4), which was significantly 
      different from negative control samples (34.0 ± 2.6 cycles; n = 3). Using a more 
      clinically relevant sample, we extracted and amplified Plasmodium falciparum DNA 
      from malaria-infected human blood cultures. The average cycle threshold for 1% 
      parasitemia samples was 24.7 ± 1.5 cycles (n = 3) and significantly different from 
      negatives (31.5 ± 2.1 cycles; n = 3). This approach integrates biomarker extraction, 
      PCR amplification, and detection in a simple, linear tubing design with potential 
      for use as a low-resource instrument.

PG  - 291-293
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Introduction: A significant part of patients with HIV / AIDS develops 
      damage to the nervous system. There are also cases where opportunistic infections of 
      the nervous system, especially herpes viral origin, can hide the underlying disease, 
      making it difficult diagnosis. The aim: To show the possibility of HIV infection 
      mimicry a neurological pathology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical case: A 
      41-years-old female presented to The Cеntег of Infectious disorders of the Nervous 
      System (Kyiv, Ukraine) in August, 2018 after developing acute fever following by a 
      left side hemiparesis, violation of coordination. Tuberculosis and HIV denied. Her 
      physical examination showed tremor in her hands during a Barre-probe. She performed 
      the coordination tests with intent, staggering in the Romberg pose. A small brain 
      lesion was revealed at MRI. Antibodies to HSV1/2, CMV, Tox. gondii were found in the 
      CSF and blood. Blood PCR was reported to be positive for EBV DNA, and HCV RNA. A 
      rapid HIV test was negative. A repeated blood test performed 10 days after admission 
      showed low level of CD4+ T cells (36 cells /1 μl), and HIV RNA (850,104 cp / ml). 
      HIV antibodies were also revealed. As a result, patient was transferred to a 
      specialized department for further treatment. CONCLUSION: Conclusion: Considering 
      high clinical polymorphism of HIV/AIDS, physicians of all specialties should be 
      alert for the possible neurologic manifestations of this disease to timely examine 
      patients.

TI  - Expression of a novel cytokine, IL-4delta2, in HIV and HIV-tuberculosis 
      co-infection.
PG  - 1601-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Correcting the Th2 shift in HIV/AIDS represents a potential intervention 
      strategy. However data on interleukin (IL)-4 expression in HIV or AIDS are 
      un-interpretable because of failure to distinguish between IL-4 and its splice 
      variant and natural antagonist, IL-4delta2. OBJECTIVE: To determine Th1 [interferon 
      (IFN)-gamma], IL-4delta2 and Th2 (IL-4) expression in whole blood and lung lavage 
      from healthy volunteers and in HIV or HIV-tuberculosis (TB) co-infection. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional with prospective cohort. METHODS: Expression of IL-4delta2, IL-4 and 
      IFN-gamma were determined by quantitative real-time PCR, using unstimulated cells 
      from whole blood and lung lavage, in 20 HIV-TB (pulmonary) co-infected patients, 20 
      matched HIV-positive controls and 20 HIV-negative healthy volunteers. Results were 
      correlated with plasma viral load, CD4 cell counts, radiological scores and response 
      to anti-TB treatment. RESULTS: Compared to HIV negative donors, stable HIV-positive 
      donors did not have increased levels of mRNA encoding IL-4, IL-4delta2 or IFN-gamma 
      in blood or lavage. By contrast, the HIV-TB co-infected donors had increased IL-4 
      and IFN-gamma in both compartments. However the antagonist, IL-4delta2 was increased 
      only in lavage. Consequently the dominant form was IL-4delta2 in lavage, but IL-4 
      itself in blood. The lung IL-4/IFN-gamma ratio correlated with radiological disease 
      extent. With anti-TB treatment, IL-4 levels did not change whilst IL-4delta2 levels 
      increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: IL-4 and its natural antagonist, IL-4delta2 
      and are not upregulated in the absence of opportunistic infection. However in HIV-TB 
      co-infection both cytokines increase in lung, but only IL-4 in the periphery. 
      Further studies are required to determine if IL-4 facilitates systemic HIV 
      progression.

TI  - Detection of Mycobacterium abscessus from blood cultures during treatment of 
      interstitial pneumonia: a case study.
PG  - 852-7
AB  - A 76-year-old male diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia in December 2002 was 
      treated with a steroid in a nearby hospital. Exacerbation of infectious pneumonitis 
      and interstitial pneumonia required complementary inpatient treatment in August 
      2007. Although polymerase chain reaction examination of expectorated sputa revealed 
      the absence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. avium, and M. intracellulare on 
      admission, nontuberculous M. abscessus was detected in the routine blood cultures. 
      Taken together with clinical findings, M. abscessus was most likely the primary 
      causative organism. Diagnosis of mycobaterium-induced septicemia generally involves 
      the use of mycobacterium-designated bottles, MGIT method, and Ogawa medium; however, 
      we used microbe cultures with routine blood-culture bottles in the present case. Of 
      the 24 mycobacterium-induced septicemia cases reported in the past 10 years, only 
      eight cases were detected from routine blood-culture bottles; they were all rapidly 
      growing bacteria. Mycobacteria other than the rapidly growing mycobacteria display 
      delayed culture proliferation, therefore it is possible that non-detected microbes 
      were probably present in the patients despite the fact that they were suffering from 
      septicemia. In cases suspected to have severe infections, particularly those with a 
      depressed immunodefense system, blood-culture testing for mycobacteria would be 
      highly helpful for diagnosis.

TI  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in Zambia is caused by JC virus with 
      prototype regulatory region.
PG  - 475-479
LID - 10.1007/s13365-019-00746-x [doi]
AB  - There are only few documented cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
      (PML) in Africa. Whether this is caused by a lack of JC virus (JCV) spread or 
      alteration in the JCV genome is unknown. We characterized the clinical presentation, 
      laboratory findings, and JCV regulatory region (RR) pattern of the first documented 
      PML cases in Zambia as well as JCV seroprevalence among HIV(+) and HIV(-) Zambians. 
      We identified PML patients with positive JCV DNA PCR in their cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF) among subjects enrolled in an ongoing tuberculous meningitis study from 2014 
      to 2016 in Lusaka. JCV regulatory region was further characterized by duplex PCR in 
      patients' urine and CSF. Of 440 HIV(+) patients, 14 (3%) had detectable JCV DNA in 
      their CSF (age 18-50; CD4(+) T cells counts 15-155 × 10(6)/μl) vs 0/60 HIV(-) 
      patients. The main clinical manifestations included altered mental status and 
      impaired consciousness consistent with advanced PML. While prototype JCV was 
      identified by duplex PCR assay in the CSF samples of all 14 PML patients, only 
      archetype JCV was detected in their urine. All PML Zambian patients tested were 
      seropositive for JCV compared to 46% in a control group of HIV(+) and HIV(-) Zambian 
      patients without PML. PML occurs among HIV-infected individuals in Zambia and is 
      caused by CNS infection with prototype JCV, while archetype JCV strains are present 
      in their urine. JCV seroprevalence is comparable in Zambia and the USA, and PML 
      should be included in the differential diagnosis of immunosuppressed individuals 
      presenting with neurological dysfunction in Zambia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic, etiologic and clinical assessment of patients with aseptic 
      encephalomeningitis (AE); evaluation of efficacy of diagnostic process. METHODS: 
      From January 1996 to August 2002, in seventy seven patients AE was diagnosed on the 
      basis of lymphocytic predominance in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and negative culture 
      of CSF. Analysis comprised: etiology, course of the disease and spectrum of used 
      diagnostic tests. RESULTS: In 48/77 patients (62.3%) etiology was not identified. In 
      8/77 patients (10.3%) herpes simplex encephalitis was diagnosed, in 7/77 (9.1%) 
      neuroborreliosis, in 6/77 (7.8%) tuberculosis encephalitis, in 3/77 (3.9%) listerial 
      meningitis, in 3/77 (3.9%) mumps meningitis, and in remaining 2/77 (2.6%) tick-borne 
      encephalitis. The incidence of AE was higher in summer (42.9%) than in any other 
      season. In 14/77 patients (18.2%) the episode of unconsciousness occurred in the 
      course of the disease. In 6 of these 14 patient etiology was unknown, in 4 
      tuberculosis AE, in 2 herpes simplex encephalitis and in 2 neuroborreliosis was 
      diagnosed. In 7 of 77 patients (9.0%) et least one episode of convulsions occurred. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In 62.3% of patients etiology remained unknown due to clinical and 
      economic reasons. Aseptic encephalomeningitis in adults not always mean the viral 
      etiology and mild course of the disease.

TI  - [Acute onset of somnolence and amnesia due to cerebral infarction of bilateral 
      thalamus accompanied with tuberculous meningitis: a case report].
PG  - 469-73
AB  - A 55-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of somnolence and 
      aspontaneity. He was hospitalized in the psychopathic ward under the initial 
      diagnosis of depression. Chest X-ray showed infiltration in both upper lobe. Twelve 
      days later, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected from his sputum and was 
      confirmed by RT-PCR. Cerebrospinal fluid findings showed elevated ADA and 
      mononuclear cells, suggesting the presence of tuberculous meningitis. However, the 
      brain CT revealed no abnormal findings. By applying antituberculous treatment the 
      pulmonary lesion improved but psychological symptoms remained. Three months later 
      follow-up brain MRI was examined. Contrast enhanced granuloma was detected in the 
      ambiens, suprasellar and quadrigeminal cisterns. A strong signal was seen in the 
      left frontal thalamus and a weak enhanced lesion was detected in the right frontal 
      thalamus on a T2 enhanced image. These lesions showed low intensity on a T1 enhanced 
      image, suggesting cerebral infarction affecting the bilateral thalamus. Somnolence 
      and memory disorder was due to cerebral infarction of the bilateral thalamus and 
      tuberculous meningitis contributed to form the intracranial lesion. From the 
      experience of this case, it is needed to consider cerebral infarction (especially 
      the thalamus) due to tuberculous meningitis when we examine the patients with acute 
      onset of psychological symptoms.

      therapeutic effect in tuberculous meningitis patients.
PG  - 331-6
LID - 10.1159/000358219 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation of blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier 
      (BCB) dysfunction with the therapeutic effect of antitubercular agents and their 
      resistance, hoping to provide theoretical evidence for improvement of the 
      therapeutic effect. METHODS: Albumin in CSF and serum was assayed by IMMAGE. The 
      CSF/serum albumin ratio (QALB) was used to evaluate the permeability of the BCB. 
      Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the amount of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA, and an MTBDRplus reagent kit was used to determine 
      the type of drug resistance of the M. tuberculosis. RESULTS: The correlation 
      analysis showed that significant correlation existed between the grade of severity 
      of tuberculous meningitis and the QALB, and the grade of severity and the total 
      leukocyte count in the CSF, for which the correlation coefficients were 0.366 (p < 
      0.05) and 0.365 (p < 0.05), respectively. The QALB in the group of patients who 
      recovered was significantly higher than that in those patients who experienced 
      disease progression (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the permeability 
      of the BCB correlated with the cure rate in tuberculous meningitis. Specifically, in 
      the treatment of tuberculous meningitis, it is of key importance to utilize the 
      benefit of the permeability of the BCB to achieve a better outcome.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (M.tb). New cases are now mainly caused by the progression of latent 
      tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Thus, methods to diagnose and treat LTBI are urgently 
      needed to prevent the development of active TB in infected individuals and the 
      subsequent spread of the disease. In this study, a systems biology approach was 
      utilized to obtain numerous microarray data sets for mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) 
      expressed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of TB patients and 
      individuals with LTBI. Within these data sets, we identified the differentially 
      expressed mRNAs and miRNAs and further investigated which differentially expressed 
      genes and miRNAs were uniquely expressed during LTBI. The Database for Annotation, 
      Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was employed to analyze the 
      functional annotations and pathway classifications of the identified genes. To 
      further understand the unique miRNA-gene regulatory network of LTBI, we constructed 
      a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for the targeted genes. The PPI network 
      included 39 genes that were differentially and uniquely expressed in PBMCs of 
      individuals with LTBI, and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that these genes 
      were predominantly involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which plays an 
      important role in chronic inflammation. DIANA TOOLs-mirPath analysis revealed that 
      the identified miRNAs in the miRNA-gene regulatory network for LTBI were mainly 
      associated with the Hippo signaling pathway, which functions in the development of 
      inflammation. Quantitative real-time PCR verified the up expression of 
      hsa-miR-212-3p and its predicted target gene -MAPK1 which had low expression and was 
      a major component of the PPI network, and MAPK1 expression was correlated with the 
      clinicopathological characteristics of LTBI by receiver operating characteristic 
      (ROC) curve analysis. Therefore, MAPK1 has potential to be a new investigable marker 
      during LTBI, which merits our further study and solution. The unique aberrant 
      miRNA-gene regulatory network and the related PPI network identified in this study 
      provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of the immune response to LTBI, and 
      thus, may aid in the development of a novel treatment strategy.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific antigens, ESAT-6 or CFP-10 play a key role 
      in diagnosis and control MTB infection. T cell receptor (TCR) reflects the status 
      and function of T cells. However, the features of the TCR beta variable (TCRBV) 
      repertoire used against ESAT-6 and CFP-10 from MTB subjects have not been well 
      described. The molecular profiles of TCRBV complementarity-determining region 3 
      (CDR3) in PBMCs with or without ESAT-6 or CFP-10 stimulation were assayed using a 
      gene melting spectral pattern (GMSP) assay developed in our previous study. The 
      average number of skewed TCRBV family in PBMCs stimulated with ESAT-6 or CFP-10 was 
      significantly higher than that in unstimulated PBMCs. TCRBV3, BV5.1, BV12, BV13.1, 
      BV13.2, BV20 and BV24 were used more frequently than other TCRBV members in PBMCs 
      from MTB subjects, and TCRBV3, BV5.1 in stimulated PBMCs have a preference in the 
      usage of variable (V) and joining (J) segments and CDR3. The results indicate that 
      the T cell immune response in MTB subjects involves a few of specific T cells. The 
      preferred usage of certain V and J segments and CDR3s of TCRBV3 or BV5.1 may be 
      related to ESAT-6 or CFP-10 respectively, which would help clinical differential 
      diagnosis and treatment of MTB-infected subjects.

TI  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis upregulates microglial matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -3 
      expression and secretion via NF-kappaB- and Activator Protein-1-dependent monocyte 
      networks.
PG  - 6492-503

AB  - Inflammatory tissue destruction is central to pathology in CNS tuberculosis (TB). We 
      hypothesized that microglial-derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have a key 
      role in driving such damage. Analysis of all of the MMPs demonstrated that 
      conditioned medium from Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected human monocytes (CoMTb) 
      stimulated greater MMP-1, -3, and -9 gene expression in human microglial cells than 
      direct infection. In patients with CNS TB, MMP-1/-3 immunoreactivity was 
      demonstrated in the center of brain granulomas. Concurrently, CoMTb decreased 
      expression of the inhibitors, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, -3, and -4. 
      MMP-1/-3 secretion was significantly inhibited by dexamethasone, which reduces 
      mortality in CNS TB. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time-of-flight 
      analysis of CoMTb showed that TNF-alpha and IL-1beta are necessary but not 
      sufficient for upregulating MMP-1 secretion and act synergistically to drive MMP-3 
      secretion. Chemical inhibition and promoter-reporter analyses showed that NF-kappaB 
      and AP-1 c-Jun/FosB heterodimers regulate CoMTb-induced MMP-1/-3 secretion. 
      Furthermore, NF-kappaB p65 and AP-1 c-Jun subunits were upregulated in biopsy 
      granulomas from patients with cerebral TB. In summary, functionally unopposed, 
      network-dependent microglial MMP-1/-3 gene expression and secretion regulated by 
      NF-kappaB and AP-1 subunits were demonstrated in vitro and, for the first time, in 
      CNS TB patients. Dexamethasone suppression of MMP-1/-3 gene expression provides a 
      novel mechanism explaining the benefit of steroid therapy in these patients.

TI  - Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in BACTEC 12B broth cultures by the Roche 
      Amplicor PCR assay.
PG  - 900-2
AB  - To evaluate the ability of the Amplicor MTB Assay to detect Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis complex (MTBC) organisms in BACTEC 12B broth cultures, 249 cultures 
      with a growth index (GI) of > or = 20 from 160 patients were tested retrospectively. 
      Specimens were processed by standard methods, and then BACTEC 12B vials and 
      Middlebrook 7H11/7H115 plates were inoculated, incubated, and interpreted in 
      accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and laboratory protocol. From 12B 
      vials with a GI of > or = 20, and aliquot of broth was removed and frozen at -20 
      degrees C until assayed by PCR. PCR results were compared to those obtained by the 
      usual laboratory protocol, whereby MTBC organisms were identified by a DNA probe 
      assay performed on broth from 12B vials with a GI or > or = 300 or on colonies from 
      solid medium. Of the 249 broth cultures evaluated, 142 contained mycobacteria, 
      including 44 that contained MTBC organisms. Of these 44 cultures, 41 were PCR 
      positive; the 3 that were PCR negative were blood specimens collected in an Isolator 
      tube. All 98 cultures with nontuberculous mycobacteria and the 107 that did not 
      contain mycobacteria were PCR negative. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of PCR 
      were 93 and 100%, respectively. For those culture sin which MTBC organisms were 
      identified by both the DNA probe and PCR assays, the mean time from specimen 
      inoculation to detection and identification of MTBC organisms was 16 (range, 4 to 
      26) days for the PCR and 28 (range, 13 to 43) days for the DNA probe assay (P < 
      0.0001). In summary, PCR is a rapid, reliable method for detection of MTBC organisms 
      in BACTEC 12B broth cultures with a GI of > or = 20.

AB  - Background: Prior Influenza A viral (IAV) infection has been shown to increase 
      susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) and TB has also been shown to be a primary cause 
      of death during pandemics, including the Spanish Influenza outbreak of 1918-1919. 
      The majority of data has been obtained from mouse models, thus the aim of this study 
      was to determine the impact of Flu co-infection on host immunity and disease 
      severity in TB patients at diagnosis. Methods: Sputum from 282 patients with active 
      TB were analyzed for presence of FluA/FluB RNA at presentation using multiplex PCR. 
      Sputum RNA was also analyzed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) load using (16)S 
      RNA amplification. Supernatants from digested sputum and Mtb antigen-stimulated 
      whole blood were analyzed using multiplex cytokine arrays and PBMC were analyzed for 
      cytokine production from CD4+ T, CD8+ T and Mucosal Associated Invariant T cells 
      (MAITs). Results: 12 (4.3%) of TB patients were found to have FluA or FluB viral RNA 
      present in their sputum at the time of TB diagnosis. The TB/Flu co-infected patients 
      had a significantly higher bacterial load compared to those with TB mono-infection 
      (p = 0.0026). They had lower levels of IL17A in ex vivo sputum (p = 0.0275) and 
      higher MCP-1 (CCL2) levels in the blood following PPD stimulation (p = 0.0267). 
      TB/Flu co-infected subjects had significantly higher IFN-γ+IL-17+CD4+ and 
      IFN-γ+IL-17-CD8+ cells compared to TB mono-infected subjects. Conclusions: These 
      data show that Flu co-infection at time of TB diagnosis is associated with a higher 
      bacterial load and differential cellular and soluble profiles. These findings show 
      for the first time the impact of TB/Flu co-infection in a human cohort and support 
      the potential benefit of Flu vaccination in TB-endemic settings.

TI  - Clinical and genetic risk factors for the development of multi-drug resistant 
      tuberculosis in non-HIV infected patients at a tertiary care center in India: a 
      case-control study.
PG  - 183-8
AB  - Genetic susceptibility of the host to multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is 
      not fully understood. We undertook a case-control study at a tertiary care center at 
      New Delhi, India to identify the clinical and genetic predictors of MDR-TB as 
      compared to the drug sensitive TB cases. Patients with multi-drug resistant 
      tuberculosis were identified on the basis of drug sensitivity testing by the 
      proportion method. Treatment was initiated according to standard norms and all 
      patients were followed up during the period. Genomic DNA extracted from the 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell pellet was used for amplification of HLA class II 
      region (second exon) with a set of forward (5') and reverse (3') primers. A sequence 
      specific 5' biotinylated probes were used to determine 12 DRB1, 8 DQA1 and 13 DQB1 
      alleles by the PCR-SSOP method. Past history of disease, higher severity of illness, 
      inadequacy of drug treatment and presence of HLA-DRB1*14, DQB1*0503 and DQB1*0502 
      alleles were found to be significant risk factors for MDR-TB. Multivariate analysis 
      identified poor past compliance to treatment (odds ratio, OR=6.6; 95% confidence 
      interval, CI [2.0-21.5]), higher number of cavities (OR=6; 95% CI [2.1-17.3]) in 
      chest radiographs and the presence of the HLA-DRB1*14 allele (OR=8.2; 95% CI 
      [2.1-31.3]) as independent predictors of MDR-TB. Our results suggest that a 
      combination of clinical and immunogenetic parameters could provide better 
      information on drug resistance in tuberculosis with implications in therapy.

TI  - Folate Receptor-Positive Circulating Tumor Cell Detected by LT-PCR-Based Method as a 
      Diagnostic Biomarker for Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.
PG  - 1163-71

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To investigate the diagnostic performance of folate receptor-positive 
      circulating tumor cells in distinguishing non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from 
      lung benign disease by using a novel ligand-targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      detection technique. METHODS: Circulating tumor cells were enriched from 3-ml 
      peripheral blood by immunomagnetic depletion of leukocytes and then labeled with a 
      conjugate of a tumor-specific ligand folic acid and a synthesized oligonucleotide. 
      After washing off free conjugates, the stripped bound conjugates were analyzed by 
      quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty-six participants (473 patients with 
      NSCLC, 227 patients with lung benign disease, and 56 healthy donors) were randomly 
      assigned to a training set and a test set. The circulating tumor cell (CTC) levels 
      in patients with NSCLC were significant higher than those with lung benign disease 
      (p < 0.001) and healthy donors (p < 0.001). Compared with carcinoembryonic antigen, 
      neuron-specific enolase, and Cyfra21-1, CTCs displayed the highest area under the 
      receiver operating characteristic curve (training set, 0.815; validation set, 0.813) 
      in the diagnosis of NSCLC, with a markedly sensitivity (training set, 72.46%; 
      validation set, 76.37%) and specificity (training set, 88.65%; validation set, 
      82.39%). The model combining CTCs with carcinoembryonic antigen, neuron-specific 
      enolase, and Cyfra21-1 was more effective for the diagnosis of NSCLC than tumor 
      makers alone (sensitivity and specificity in the training set, 84.21% and 83.91%; 
      validation set, 88.78% and 87.36%, respectively). In addition, the CTC levels were 
      higher in patients with stage III/IV NSCLC compared with those with stage I/II 
      disease. CONCLUSION: Ligand-targeted PCR technique was feasible and reliable for 
      detecting folate receptor-positive CTCs in patients with NSCLC, and CTC levels could 
      be used as a useful biomarker for the diagnosis of NSCLC.

TI  - Recombinant BCG::Rv2645 elicits enhanced protective immunity compared to BCG in vivo 
      with induced ISGylation-related genes and Th1 and Th17 responses.

AB  - There is a need to develop protective vaccines against tuberculosis (TB). Recently, 
      we identified an immunodominant T-cell antigen, Rv2645, from the region of deletion 
      13 (RD13) of M. tuberculosis (M. tb) H37Rv, which is absent in Bacille 
      Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Here, a recombinant BCG expressing Rv2645, namely, 
      BCG::Rv2645, was constructed. Compared to BCG, we found that BCG::Rv2645 improved 
      the antigen presentation capacity of dendritic cells (DCs) and elicited much 
      stronger Th1 and Th17 responses, higher CD44(high)CD62(low) effector memory CD4(+) T 
      cells (T(EM)), and fewer T regulated cells (Treg) and regulatory B10 in mice. 
      Importantly, BCG::Rv2645 exhibited enhanced protective efficacy against virulent M. 
      tb H37Rv challenge in both mice and rhesus monkeys, showing less severe pathology 
      and reduced pathogens. Further, transcriptomic analysis and reverse 
      transcription-quantitative real time PCR revealed that the mRNA levels of ISGylation 
      (Isg)-related genes such as interferon-stimulated gene 15 (Isg15), and Th1- and 
      Th17-related genes such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-17A (IL-17A) were 
      significantly up-regulated in splenocytes and macrophages after stimulation with 
      Rv2645. This study shows that BCG::Rv2645 is a promising TB vaccine candidate with 
      enhanced protective immunity. The enhanced Th1/Th17 immune responses and 
      up-regulation of ISGylation-related genes induced by Rv2645 may be major factors 
      contributing to the protective immunity of BCG::Rv2645.

AB  - One hundred fifty-three blood samples from patients positive for the human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to 
      detect the presence of Mycobacterium avium. Samples were collected from patients who 
      also had blood cultures performed by a radiometric method. Blood samples were 
      centrifuged on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient to purify peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells. The purified cells were washed and incubated with a resin, boiled to release 
      mycobacterial DNA, and then amplified. Polymerase chain reaction products were 
      detected by a nonisotopic method. A 123 base-pair (bp) insertion sequence, namely 
      IS6110, from Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was also included in the reaction as 
      an internal control of Taq polymerase activity to exclude the presence of enzyme 
      inhibitors. This IS6110 fragment can be distinguished from the 383 bp target product 
      on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel and may also be used in a colorimetric 
      assay. Such results were compared with the results of culture and indicated that the 
      assay is as sensitive as bacteriological methods, though faster.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the use of two indirect IgG-ELISA tests (with 
      recombinant proteins MPB70 or MPB83, respectively, as capture antigens) as 
      confirmatory tests for diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis in a herd of naturally 
      infected dairy cows. Results for ELISA-MPB70 and ELISA-MPB83 were similar (kappa 
      statistic=0.92) on Days 0 (day of intradermal injection with purified protein 
      derivatives, PPD), 7, and 21. The kappa statistic between ELISA and the Comparative 
      Intradermal Tuberculin Test, as well as ELISA sensitivity and specificity (relative 
      to culture or PCR as standards) were: 0.7, 34.4% and 75% on Day 0; 0.25, 53.8% and 
      66.6% on Day 7; and 0.01, 1.8% and 77.7% on Day 21, respectively. In conclusion, 
      although ELISAs using MPB70 or MPB83 as antigens were not reliable indicators of 
      infection status, especially on Days 7 and 21, they were of potential value as 
      complementary tools to intradermal PPD testing.

TI  - Prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium infections with sub-microscopic parasite 
      densities in the northwestern border of Thailand: a potential threat to malaria 
      elimination.
PG  - 329
LID - 10.1186/s12936-018-2476-1 [doi]
LID - 329
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic infections with sub-microscopic Plasmodium serve as a 
      silent reservoir of disease, critical to sustaining a low level of remanent malaria 
      in the population. These infections must be effectively identified and targeted for 
      elimination. The sensitivity of light microscopy, the traditional method used for 
      diagnosing Plasmodium infections, is frequently insufficient for detecting 
      asymptomatic infections due to the low density of parasitaemia. The objective of 
      this study was to explore the current prevalence of asymptomatic sub-microscopic 
      Plasmodium carriages to evaluate the parasite reservoir amongst residents from 7 
      hamlets in Tak Province in northwestern Thailand using a highly sensitive molecular 
      method. METHODS: Malaria infection was screened in a real-world setting from 3650 
      finger-prick blood specimens collected in a mass cross-sectional survey using light 
      microscopy and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). LAMP results were 
      later confirmed in a laboratory setting in Bangkok using nested PCR, restriction 
      enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing. The association of malaria infection with 
      demographic factors was explored. RESULTS: Parasite prevalence was 0.27% (10/3650) 
      as determined by microscopy. Sub-microscopic infection prevalence was 2.33% 
      (85/3650) by LAMP. Of these, 30.6% (26/85) were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, 
      52.9% (45/85) with Plasmodium vivax, 2.4% (2/85) with Plasmodium malariae, 4.7% 
      (4/85) with mixed P. falciparum and P. vivax, and 9.4% (8/85) had parasite densities 
      too low for species identification. Asymptomatic carriages (T < 37.5 °C) accounted 
      for 95% (76/80) of all sub-microscopic cases with the highest prevalence occurring 
      in the subjects 31-45 years of age (p ≤ 0.035). Participants working on plantations 
      or as merchants had an increased infection risk. Evaluation by microscopy identified 
      10.53% (10/95) of all Plasmodium infected participants. CONCLUSION: Participants 
      carrying asymptomatic Plasmodium infections with sub-microscopic parasite densities 
      are considerable in this area. These findings provide the true disease burden and 
      risk factors in this region. This information helps to direct policy makers towards 
      better schemes and delivery of targeted interventions. Moreover, this is the first 
      study to use LAMP in mass screening for sub-clinical and sub-microscopic infections 
      in a field setting in Thailand. LAMP proves to be a sensitive and field-deployable 
      assay suitable for national malaria control screening campaigns.

AB  - PURPOSE: The establishment of candidate genes associated with susceptibility to TB 
      is a challenge especially due to divergent frequencies among different populations. 
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between macrophage 
      migration inhibitory factor (MIF) -173 G>C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and 
      susceptibility to pulmonary TB in a population of southern Brazil. METHODS: 
      Case-control study. Patients > 18 years old, diagnosed with pulmonary TB were 
      included. The control group consisted of blood donors and household contacts, not 
      relatives, healthy and > 18 years old. MIF -173 G>C SNPs were genotyped using 
      real-time PCR using a TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. RESULTS: 174 patients and 166 
      controls were included. There were no statistically significant differences between 
      cases and controls regarding genotype prevalence (p>0.05). Comparing patients with 
      normal genotype (GG) with those with at least one C allele, there was also no 
      statistically significant difference (p = 0.135). Also, there was no statistically 
      significant difference comparing the homozygous for the mutation (CC) with the other 
      patients (GG and CG) (p = 0.864). CONCLUSIONS: We did not find association between 
      MIF -173 G>C polymorphism and susceptibility to pulmonary TB.

PG  - 2565-2571

AB  - Our previous studies showed that mycobacterial L-forms persist in the blood of BCG 
      vaccinated people and that BCG vaccine is able to produce, under appropriate 
      conditions, filterable, self-replicating L-bodies with virus-like size. Because 
      filterability is one of the characteristics of L-forms, considerable interest has 
      been shown in their capacity to cross the maternal-fetal barrier. The current study 
      demonstrated isolation of mycobacterial L-form cultures from umbilical cord blood of 
      5 healthy newborns of healthy mothers vaccinated previously with BCG. The isolated 
      cultures showed distinctive growth characteristics of cell wall deficient L-form 
      bacteria. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated presence of L-bodies with 
      extremely small size of 100 nm and revealed morphological transformations, typical 
      for L-forms. IS6110 Real Time PCR assay confirmed that all L-form isolates were of 
      mycobacterial origin and belonged to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex which 
      includes vaccinal BCG substrains. In conclusion, we could suggest that reproductive 
      filterable L-bodies of BCG origin are able to fall in blood circulation of the fetus 
      by vertical transmitted pathway and colonize newborns.

TI  - Molecular detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in formalin-fixed, 
      paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies of gastrointestinal specimens using real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction system.
PG  - 129-34
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: We aimed to perform the molecular detection of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies of 
      gastrointestinal specimens using real-time polymerase chain reaction system. 
      METHODS: The study included three groups: (A) control (n=24), with no previous signs 
      of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC), (B) patients (n=28) with known TB origin and (C) 
      patients (n=50) with clinical and histopathological signs of TB but who were 
      culture- and acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-negative. The samples were obtained from the 
      Medical and Surgical Gastroenterology Departments of Bhopal Memorial Hospital and 
      Research Centre. We extracted DNA using DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (QIAGEN, Germany) 
      and performed realtime assay using Roche LightCycler 2.0 with fluorescence resonance 
      energy transfer (FRET) hybridization probes obtained from Roche Molecular 
      Diagnostics (USA) for the specific amplification of the 159 bp region of the 
      mycobacterium genome. RESULTS: All the samples (n=24) of Group A were found to be 
      negative, while in Group B, 27 out of the 28 cases studied were found to be positive 
      by LightCycler real-time polymerase chain reaction (LC PCR). In Group C, 18 out of 
      the 50 cases studied were found to be positive, showing a positivity of 36%. The 
      overall positive and negative predictive values of the test for clinical TB (Group 
      C) were 100% and 96.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results of our investigation 
      demonstrated that the real-time detection technology using FRET probes has much 
      higher sensitivity for the detection of MTBC DNA in tissue biopsy samples and 
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgically resected tissues of the gastrointestinal 
      tract.

TI  - Two novel TSC2 mutations in pediatric patients with tuberous sclerosis complex: Case 
      report.

AB  - RATIONALE: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder. 
      The TSC1 and TSC2 genes have been identified as pathogenic genes. PATIENT CONCERNS: 
      In this report, we are discussing a novel frameshift mutation and a novel missense 
      mutation in the TSC2 gene. DIAGNOSES: The two cases discussed in this study met the 
      latest diagnostic criteria for TSC published by the International Tuberculosis 
      Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference in 2012. INTERVENTIONS: High-throughput 
      sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were used to 
      examine tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-related genes (TSC1 and TSC2) and their 
      splicing regions using peripheral blood DNA from two probands in two families with 
      TSC and to identify the genetic mutation sites. Amplification primers were designed 
      for the mutation sites, and polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing were 
      used to verify the peripheral blood DNA sequences from the probands and their 
      parents. OUTCOME: Proband 1 had the c.1228 (exon 12)_c.1229 (exon 12) insG 
      (p.L410RfsX11) heterozygous mutation in the TSC2 gene (chr16), which was a new 
      frameshift mutation. Proband 2 had the c.4925G>A (exon 38) (p.G1642D) heterozygous 
      mutation in the TSC2 gene (chr16), which was a new missense mutation. LESSONS: These 
      two novel mutations may be pathogenic mutations for TSC, and their association with 
      the disease needs to be further verified by mutant protein function cell model and 
      animal model.

TI  - Sudden death from tubercular myocarditis.
PG  - 667-9
AB  - Tuberculous myocarditis is a rare finding. We present the case of a 33-year-old 
      woman who was in good health and who died suddenly at home. Autopsy and 
      histopathologic examinations revealed granulamatous lesions in the myocardium, 
      lungs, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. No fast acid bacilli were demonstrated on 
      histological examination. The presence of a Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA complex 
      was identified using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded histological samples. An HIV test carried out on the blood 
      obtained during the autopsy was negative according to the DNA amplification 
      technique (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serological test. We 
      hypothesize that the mechanism of death was severe ventricular arrhythmia due to 
      granulomatous proliferation in the structures of the interventricular septum.

AB  - Possible persistence of bacteria in human blood as cell wall deficient forms 
      (L-forms) represents a top research priority for microbiologists. Application of 
      live BCG vaccine and L-form transformation of vaccine strain may display a new 
      intriguing aspect concerning the opportunity for occurrence of unpredictable 
      colonization inside the human body by unusual microbial life forms. L-form cultures 
      were isolated from 141 blood samples of people previously vaccinated with BCG, none 
      with a history of exposure to tuberculosis. Innovative methodology to access the 
      unusual L-form elements derived from human blood was developed. The methodology 
      outlines the path of transformation of non- cultivable L-form element to cultivable 
      bacteria and their adaptation for growth in vitro. All isolates showed typical 
      L-forms growth features ("fried eggs" colonies and biofilm). Electron microscopy 
      revealed morphology evidencing peculiar characteristics of bacterial L-form 
      population (cell wall deficient polymorphic elements of variable shape and size). 
      Regular detection of acid fast bacteria in smears of isolated blood L-form cultures, 
      led us to start their identification by using specific Mycobactrium spp. genetic 
      tests. Forty five of 97 genetically tested blood cultures provided specific positive 
      signals for mycobacteria, confirmed by at least one of the 3 specific assays (16S 
      rRNA PCR; IS6110 Real Time PCR and spoligotyping). In conclusion, the obtained 
      genetic evidence suggests that these L-forms are of mycobacterial origin. As the 
      investigated people had been vaccinated with BCG, we can assume that the identified 
      mycobacterial L-forms may be produced by persisting live BCG vaccine.

AB  - Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is formed by the interaction of IL-12p35 and IL-12p40 
      expressed independently from IL-12A and IL-12B genes. This interleukin plays 
      prominent role in the T-helper type-1 (Th1) response against intracellular 
      pathogens. Variations in IL-12B gene causes disruption of various activities one of 
      them is suppression of Th1 response and is one of the characteristic features 
      observed in patients with active tuberculosis. Hence, in the present study IL-12B 
      gene status was evaluated in 50 new sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis 
      patients (NSP-PTB) as identified by Ziehl-Nielsen (ZN) staining and 50 apparently 
      healthy control subjects (HCS) who were sputum smear-negative. The sequence analysis 
      showed novel missense mutations p.Ser205Ile, p.Leu206Glu, p.Pro207Ser, p.Glu209Lys, 
      p.Val210Ser, p.(Ser205_Cys327delinsIleGlu) and p.(Lys217_Leu218delinsIle) were found 
      in exon 5 of the IL-12B gene in nine patients resulting formation of inactive IL-12 
      and three patients showed novel frame shift mutations p.(Asn222Leufs∗23) in exon 5 
      of causing the formation of truncated protein. Several mutations were noted in 
      intron 2 of the IL-12B gene in 5 patients and in 13 patients mutations were observed 
      in 3' UTR region. All together 30/50 patients (60%) showed mutations in IL-12B gene. 
      Decreased levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and IL-12 as determined by ELISA and 
      flow cytometry were observed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture 
      supernatants in TB patients having mutations compared with control subjects. 
      Further, in silico analysis revealed due to frame shift mutations in exon 5 at 
      Asn222 resulted in deletion of functional fibronectin type-III (FN3) domain which 
      leads to formation of inactive IL-12 in these patients.

TI  - Initiation of the adaptive immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis depends on 
      antigen production in the local lymph node, not the lungs.
PG  - 105-15
AB  - The onset of the adaptive immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is delayed 
      compared with that of other infections or immunization, and allows the bacterial 
      population in the lungs to expand markedly during the preimmune phase of infection. 
      We used adoptive transfer of M. tuberculosis Ag85B-specific CD4(+) T cells to 
      determine that the delayed adaptive response is caused by a delay in initial 
      activation of CD4(+) T cells, which occurs earliest in the local lung-draining 
      mediastinal lymph node. We also found that initial activation of Ag85B-specific T 
      cells depends on production of antigen by bacteria in the lymph node, despite the 
      presence of 100-fold more bacteria in the lungs. Although dendritic cells have been 
      found to transport M. tuberculosis from the lungs to the local lymph node, airway 
      administration of LPS did not accelerate transport of bacteria to the lymph node and 
      did not accelerate activation of Ag85B-specific T cells. These results indicate that 
      delayed initial activation of CD4(+) T cells in tuberculosis is caused by the 
      presence of the bacteria in a compartment that cannot be mobilized from the lungs to 
      the lymph node, where initial T cell activation occurs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early mortality among HIV-positive adults starting antiretroviral 
      therapy (ART) remains high in resource-limited settings, with tuberculosis (TB) the 
      leading cause of death. However, current methods to estimate TB-related deaths are 
      inadequate and most autopsy studies do not adequately represent those attending 
      primary health clinics (PHCs). This study aimed to determine the autopsy prevalence 
      of TB and other infections in adults enrolled at South African PHCs in the context 
      of a pragmatic trial of empiric TB treatment ("TB Fast Track"). METHODS AND 
      FINDINGS: Adults with CD4 ≤150 cells/μL, not on ART or TB treatment, were enrolled 
      to TB Fast Track and followed up for at least six months. Minimally invasive autopsy 
      (MIA) was conducted as soon as possible after death. Lungs, liver, and spleen were 
      biopsied; blood, CSF, and urine aspirated; and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
      obtained. Samples underwent mycobacterial, bacterial, and fungal culture; molecular 
      testing (including Xpert® MTB/RIF); and histological examination. 34 MIAs were 
      conducted: 18 (53%) decedents were female; median age was 39 (interquartile range 
      33-44) years; 25 (74%) deaths occurred in hospitals; median time from death to MIA 
      was five (IQR 3-6) days. 16/34 (47%) had evidence of TB (14/16 [88%] with 
      extrapulmonary disease; 6/16 [38%] not started on treatment antemortem); 23 (68%) 
      had clinically important bacterial infections; four (12%) cryptococcal disease; 
      three (9%) non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease; and two (6%) Pneumocystis 
      pneumonia. Twenty decedents (59%) had evidence of two or more concurrent infections; 
      9/16 (56%) individuals with TB had evidence of bacterial disease and two (13%) 
      cryptococcal disease. CONCLUSIONS: TB, followed by bacterial infections, were the 
      leading findings at autopsy among adults with advanced HIV enrolled from primary 
      care clinics. To reduce mortality, strategies are needed to identify and direct

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies have demonstrated that Galactooligosaccharides 
      (GOS), known as "bifidus factor", has anti-inflammatory effects. Colitis, a kind of 
      colonic inflammatory damage could be induced by different chemicals. The 
      pathogenesis and mechanism of colitis remains unclear, and may be related to 
      intestinal microflora, genetic susceptibility or immune factors. The aim is to 
      explore the effects of GOS on intestinal flora and its anti-inflammatory effects in 
      Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) induced murine colitis and extrapolate the underlying 
      mechanism. MAIN METHODS: Initially, 5% DSS was used to induced colitis by free 
      access to drinking water for 5-7 days. Then the mice were treated with GOS 1 day 
      after DSS treatment. Colon samples were evaluated grossly using a microscope. The 
      percentage of Treg and Th17 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. The levels of 
      cytokines secretion and mRNA expression were detected by ELISA and real-time PCR. 
      The level of protein was detected by western blot. KEY FINDINGS: GOS attenuated DSS 
      induced body weight loss and also reduced the increase in disease index caused by 
      DSS. GOS ameliorated DSS induced colonic histological damage. The protective effect 
      of GOS on DSS induced colitis may be partly attributed to intestinal flora 
      regulation and Th17/Treg imbalance. Furthermore, GOS markedly decreased cytokines 
      (IL-6, IL-18, IL-13 and IL-33) secretion and mRNA expression in colon tissues, 
      through inhibiting activation of NF-κB pathways. SIGNIFICANCE: GOS could prevent the 
      DSS induced colitis through intestinal flora regulation and reduce the secretion of 
      inflammation related cytokines relying on the NF-κB signaling pathway.

AB  - To develop a simple immunomonitoring method for dendritic cell therapy using 
      messenger RNA (mRNA) as antigen, we evaluated whether Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      antigen 85A (Ag85A) mRNA-transfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
      could be used to stimulate the induction of interferon (IFN)-gamma-producing T 
      cells. PBMCs from 10 healthy donors were cocultured with autologous PBMCs 
      transfected with mRNA overnight, and the number of IFN-gamma-producing T cells was 
      measured by flow cytometry. IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected 
      in 4 and 5 donors, respectively. PBMCs from 3 donors with negative results were then 
      cocultured with Ag85A mRNA-transfected autologous PBMCs for 1 week to achieve in 
      vitro primary induction of Ag85A-specific T cells. After restimulation with freshly 
      prepared stimulator cells, a small but significant number of IFN-gamma-producing 
      CD8+ T cells was detected. The induction of IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells by 
      overnight coculture was completely abolished by anti-class II or anti-interleukin-12 
      antibodies, whereas it was partially inhibited by anti-class I antibody. These data 
      suggest that Ag85A mRNA-transfected PBMCs induce specific IFN-gamma-producing T 
      cells and might be applicable for immunomonitoring of mRNA-loaded dendritic cell 
      therapy.

TI  - Human cytomegalovirus DNA level in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 67-75
AB  - The objectives of the study were to estimate human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA copy 
      number in broncho-alveolar lavage cells, blood leukocytes, and serum of patients 
      with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The study groups consisted of 16 patients, 
      newly diagnosed with IPF and never treated, (mean age 40.9 +/-11.0 yr; F/M-7/9) and 
      in 16 adult healthy volunteers (mean age 36.8 +/-6.4 yr; F/M-4/12) used as controls. 
      The HCMV DNA copy number was calculated by a Q-PCR method using TaqMan ABI PRISM 
      7700. We found that the prevalence of the HCMV DNA positive subjects in the patient 
      group (75%) did not differ significantly from that in the control group (69%). We 
      also found that in both patient and control groups the mean HCMV DNA copy number in 
      BAL cells was significantly higher than that in blood leukocytes (log10=2.7 vs. 1.2 
      for patients and 2.8 vs. 0.9 for controls, respectively). However, a higher HCMV DNA 
      copy number in blood serum was observed in IPF patients than in controls (log10=3.2 
      vs. 2.0, respectively). We conclude that the lungs play an important role in the 
      human pathobiology of cytomegalovirus sustenance.

TI  - [Detection of bacterial DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)].
PG  - 104-10
AB  - Enzymatic amplification of DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a very 
      sensitive and rapid way of detecting specific DNA sequences. Bacterial DNA can be 
      detected in a wide variety of samples provided at least partial sequence information 
      is available. For a great number of bacteria PCR detection methods have been 
      published. Most important for the pathologist are mycobacteriae (M. tuberculosis, 
      avium, etc.). Borellia burgdorferi, Listeria monozytogenes and chlamydiae (Ce. 
      trachomatis, C. psittaci). Fresh or fixed paraffin embedded tissues, exfoliated 
      cells, whole blood, serum, sputum, urine, ascites or pleural fluid etc. can be 
      analyzed. The time needed to perform the analysis varies between 5 hours and 2 days 
      mostly depending on the DNA extraction method. Several potential pitfalls have to be 
      avoided. The most common problem is contamination of reagents with target DNA. 
      Amplification of DNA from biological samples may be prevented by enzyme inhibitors 
      (salts, proteins). This problem can at least partially be avoided by changing the 
      DNA purification method. Several additional problems may arise if bacterial DNA has 
      to be amplified. Bacterial walls may have to be disrupted using heat or detergent 
      for accessibility of target DNA. Positive results have to be judged carefully. 
      Unlike the situation in retroviral infections with the virus sometimes present in 
      the absence of disease, in the majority of bacterial infections the presence of 
      bacteria signals manifest disease. A possible exception may be the finding of 
      mycobacterial DNA in sarcoidosis patients who can be treated with steroids without 
      provoking tuberculosis. PCR is especially useful in situations where rapid results 
      are necessary or only fixed tissue is available.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for a simple and accurate test for the diagnosis 
      of human Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the infectious agent causing tuberculosis (TB). 
      Here we describe a serological test based on light emitting recombinant proteins for 
      the diagnosis of pulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. METHODS: Luciferase 
      Immunoprecipitation Systems (LIPS), a fluid-phase immunoassay, was used to examine 
      antibody responses against a panel of 24 different M. tuberculosis proteins. Three 
      different strategies were used for generating the constructs expressing the 
      recombinant fusion M. tuberculosis proteins with luciferase: synthetic gene 
      synthesis, Gateway recombination cloning, and custom PCR synthesis. A pilot cohort 
      of African pulmonary TB patients was used for initial antibody screening and 
      confirmatory studies with selected antigens were performed with a cohort from 
      Thailand and healthy US blood donors. In addition to testing M. tuberculosis 
      antigens separately, a mixture that tested seven antigens simultaneously was 
      evaluated for diagnostic performance. RESULTS: LIPS testing of a pilot set of serum 
      samples from African pulmonary TB patients identified a potential subset of 
      diagnostically useful M. tuberculosis antigens. Evaluation of a second independent 
      cohort from Thailand validated highly significant antibody responses against seven 
      antigens (PstS1, Rv0831c, FbpA, EspB, bfrB, HspX and ssb), which often showed robust 
      antibody levels up to 50- to 1000-fold higher than local community controls. Marked 
      heterogeneity of antibody responses was observed in the patients and the combined 
      results demonstrated 73.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detection of 
      pulmonary TB. A LIPS test simultaneously employing the seven M. tuberculosis antigen 
      as a mixture matched the combined diagnostic performance of the separate tests, but 
      showed an even higher diagnostic sensitivity (90%) when a cut-off based on healthy 
      US blood donors was used. CONCLUSION: A LIPS immunoassay employing multiple M. 
      tuberculosis antigens shows promise for the rapid and quantitative serological 
      detection of pulmonary TB.

TI  - Identification, molecular cloning, and evaluation of potential use of isocitrate 
      dehydrogenase II of Mycobacterium bovis BCG in serodiagnosis of tuberculosis.
PG  - 846-51
AB  - Diagnosis of tuberculosis is time-consuming and requires infrastructures which are 
      often not available in countries with high incidences of the disease. In the present 
      study, an 82-kDa protein antigen was isolated by affinity chromatography and was 
      identified by peptide mass fingerprinting as isocitrate dehydrogenase II, which is 
      encoded by the icd2 gene of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The icd2 gene of BCG was cloned 
      by PCR, and the product of recombinant gene expression was purified and analyzed by 
      two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant protein, named 
      rICD2, was tested for its recognition by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from the 
      sera of 16 patients with tuberculosis (TB) and 23 healthy individuals by Western 
      blotting. The results showed that rICD2 is recognized by IgG antibodies from the 
      sera of all TB patients tested at serum dilutions of > or = 1:640. At a serum 
      dilution of 1:1,280, the sensitivity was 50% and the specificity was 86.9%. These 
      results indicate that rICD2 might represent a candidate for use in a new assay for 
      the serodiagnosis of TB.

TI  - Comparative evaluation of positive tests to Mycobacterium avium subsp. 
      paratuberculosis in clinically healthy sheep and goats in south-west Greece using 
      molecular techniques, serology, and culture.
PG  - 337-43
AB  - Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the cause of paratuberculosis, 
      which affects mainly ruminants although there is a growing concern about its 
      possible implication in Crohn's disease in humans especially in connection with 
      environmental spread and risks to the food chain. Retail cheese may represent a 
      significant source of human exposure to MAP and the aim of this study was to assess 
      MAP status in clinically healthy sheep and goats in Greece, comparing techniques 
      routinely used in the positive diagnosis of the disease. From a total of 30 flocks, 
      632 sheep and goats had faecal, serum, and whole-blood samples examined by culture, 
      complement fixation test (CFT), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeted at 
      IS900, IS1245, and IS6110. PCR produced positive results in 21% of the animals 
      tested, with 5.6%, 3.9%, and 11.5% being identified as MAP, Mycobacterium avium 
      subsp. avium, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, respectively. CFT produced 
      positive and suspicious results in 4.4% and 14.4% of the cases. Faecal cultures were 
      negative in all but a single case that was identified as restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism (RFLP)-type BC1. Agreement between results obtained by PCR and CFT was 
      poor with isolated cases although an assessment of the MAP positive tests produced 
      similar results for both methods. The findings indicate the need for additional 
      measures of control, although the costs may be substantial if public health 
      protection justifies elimination of MAP from livestock.

TI  - Cohort profile of a study on outcomes related to tuberculosis and antiretroviral 
      drug concentrations in Uganda: design, methods and patient characteristics of the

AB  - PURPOSE: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death among people living with HIV 
      in sub-Saharan Africa. Several factors influence the efficacy of TB treatment by 
      leading to suboptimal drug concentrations and subsequently affecting treatment 
      outcome. The aim of this cohort is to determine the association between anti-TB drug 
      concentrations and TB treatment outcomes. PARTICIPANTS: Patients diagnosed with new 
      pulmonary TB at the integrated TB-HIV outpatient clinic in Kampala, Uganda, were 
      enrolled into the study and started on first-line anti-TB treatment. FINDINGS TO 
      DATE: Between April 2013 and April 2015, the cohort enrolled 268 patients coinfected 
      with TB/HIV ; 57.8% are male with a median age of 34 years (IQR 29-40). The median 
      time between the diagnosis of HIV and the diagnosis of TB is 2 months (IQR 0-22.5). 
      The majority of the patients are antiretroviral therapy naive (75.4%). Our 
      population is severely immunosuppressed with a median CD4 cell count at enrolment of 
      163 cells/µL (IQR 46-298). Ninety-nine per cent of the patients had a diagnosis of 
      pulmonary TB confirmed by sputum microscopy, Xpert/RIF or culture and 203 (75.7%) 
      have completed TB treatment with 5099 aliquots of blood collected for 
      pharmacokinetic analysis. FUTURE PLANS: This cohort provides a large database of 
      well-characterised patients coinfected with TB/HIV which will facilitate the 
      description of the association between serum drug concentrations and TB treatment 
      outcomes as well as provide a research platform for future substudies including 
      evaluation of virological outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01782950;

TI  - The Mycobacterium tuberculosis membrane protein Rv2560--biochemical and functional 
      studies.
PG  - 6352-64
AB  - The characterization of membrane proteins having no identified function in 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis is important for a better understanding of the biology of 
      this pathogen. In this work, the biological activity of the Rv2560 protein was 
      characterized and evaluated. Primers used in PCR and RT-PCR assays revealed that the 
      gene encoding protein Rv2560 is present in M. tuberculosis complex strains, but 
      transcribed in only some of them. Sera obtained from rabbits inoculated with polymer 
      peptides from this protein recognized a 33 kDa band in the M. tuberculosis lysate 
      and a membrane fraction corresponding to the predicted molecular mass (33.1 kDa) of 
      this protein. Immunoelectron microscopy analysis found this protein on the 
      mycobacterial membrane. Sixteen peptides covering its entire length were chemically 
      synthesized and tested for their ability to bind to A549 and U937 cells. Peptide 
      11024 (121VVALSDRATTAYTNTSGVSS140) showed high specific binding to both cell types 
      (dissociation constants of 380 and 800 nm, respectively, and positive 
      receptor-ligand interaction cooperativity), whereas peptide 11033 
      (284LIGIPVAALIHVYTYRKLSGG304) displayed high binding activity to A549 cells only. 
      Cross-linking assays showed the specific binding of peptide 11024 to a 54 kDa 
      membrane protein on U937. Invasion inhibition assays, in the presence of shared 
      high-activity binding peptide identified for U937 and A549 cells, presented maximum 
      inhibition percentages of 50.53% and 58.27%, respectively. Our work highlights the 
      relevance of the Rv2560 protein in the M. tuberculosis invasion process of monocytes 
      and epithelial cells, and represents a fundamental step in the rational selection of 
      new antigens to be included as components in a multiepitope, subunit-based, 
      chemically synthesized, antituberculosis vaccine.

TI  - Greater diversity of HIV-1 quasispecies in HIV-infected individuals with active 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 408-17
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A continual increase in intrapatient HIV-1 heterogeneity is thought to 
      contribute to evasion of host immune response and eventual progression to AIDS. 
      Tuberculosis (TB) is diagnosed both early and late during the course of HIV-1 
      disease and may increase diversity of HIV-1 quasispecies by activating the HIV-1 
      immune response and increasing HIV-1 replication. We examined whether HIV-1 
      heterogeneity is altered in HIV-1-infected individuals with TB. METHODS: Blood 
      samples were obtained from 7 HIV-1-infected patients with active TB (HIV/TB 
      patients) and 9 HIV-1-infected patients (HIV patients) in Kampala, Uganda (CD4 
      counts of 0-650 cells/microl and HIV loads of 700-750,000 RNA copies/ml). The C2-C3 
      region of the HIV-1 envelope gene (env) was amplified by nested polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) from lysed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of each 
      patient, and then subject to sequencing, clonal-quasispecies analysis and 
      heteroduplex tracking analysis (HTA). RESULTS: HTA of env DNA fragments showed 
      increased heterogeneity in the HIV/TB individuals compared with the HIV group. 
      Further sequence and HTA analysis on ten individual env clones for each patient 
      showed significantly greater HIV mutation frequencies in HIV/TB patients than in HIV 
      patients. CONCLUSION: An increase in HIV-1 heterogeneity may be associated with a 
      TB-mediated increase in HIV-1 replication. However, a diverse HIV-1 quasispecies 
      population in HIV/TB patients as opposed to tight quasispecies clusters in HIV 
      patients suggests a possible dissemination of lung-derived HIV-1 isolates from the 
      TB-affected organ.

TI  - Effect of sample handling on analysis of cytokine responses to Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis in clinical samples using ELISA, ELISPOT and quantitative PCR.
PG  - 129-41
AB  - Measuring cytokine responses to infection has proven to be invaluable for the 
      understanding of immunity to tuberculosis in the laboratory. However, far less data 
      are available from studies in humans and these have often produced conflicting 
      results. Here we describe a comprehensive multi-center comparison of the most 
      commonly used protocols for cytokine analysis: ELISA, ELISPOT and RT-PCR, in cohorts 
      of TB patients, their household contacts and community controls. In particular, we 
      have studied the effect on these protocols of conditions that commonly prevail in 
      field studies, such as delays between sample collection and analysis, or different 
      source material, such as whole blood or frozen PBMC. The results clearly show that 
      while there is good correlation between the methods under optimal conditions, each 
      method has strengths and weaknesses that render them more or less suitable for 
      particular types of analyses. Researchers should carefully consider these factors 
      when planning human field studies.

AB  - In DNA vaccines, the gene of interest is cloned into a bacterial plasmid that is 
      engineered to induce protein production for long periods in eukaryotic cells. 
      Previous research has shown that the intramuscular immunization of BALB/c mice with 
      a naked plasmid DNA fragment encoding the Mycobacterium leprae 65-kDa heat-shock 
      protein (pcDNA3-Hsp65) induces protection against M. tuberculosis challenge. A key 
      stage in the protective immune response after immunization is the generation of 
      memory T cells. Previously, we have shown that B cells capture plasmid DNA-Hsp65 and 
      thereby modulate the formation of CD8+ memory T cells after M. tuberculosis 
      challenge in mice. Therefore, clarifying how B cells act as part of the protective 
      immune response after DNA immunization is important for the development of 
      more-effective vaccines. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by 
      which B cells modulate memory T cells after DNA-Hsp65 immunization. C57BL/6 and BKO 
      mice were injected three times, at 15-day intervals, with 100 µg naked pcDNA-Hsp65 
      per mouse. Thirty days after immunization, the percentages of effector memory T 
      (TEM) cells (CD4+ and CD8+/CD44high/CD62Llow) and memory CD8+ T cells 
      (CD8+/CD44high/CD62Llow/CD127+) were measured with flow cytometry. Interferon γ, 
      interleukin 12 (IL-12), and IL-10 mRNAs were also quantified in whole spleen cells 
      and purified B cells (CD43-) with real-time qPCR. Our data suggest that a B-cell 
      subpopulation expressing IL-10 downregulated proinflammatory cytokine expression in 
      the spleen, increasing the survival of CD4+ TEM cells and CD8+ TEM/CD127+ cells.

PG  - 28-32
AB  - AIM: To determine the role of histological diagnosis of lymphadenopathy (LAP) 
      associated with clinico-laboratory picture in patients with HIV infection/AIDS. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Target biopsy of the peripheral lymph node was made in 80 
      HIV-infected patients from 2002 to 2005. Histological diagnosis was made in all the 
      patients with light microscopy, in some patients at immunohistological examination. 
      RESULTS: Most of the patients had peripheral blood CD4 lymphocytes under 200 
      cell/mcl. Viral load was hundred thousands copies in mcl. Tuberculosis was diagnosed 
      in 33 (41%) patients, lymphomas--in 23(29%), lymphogranulomatosis--in 5 (6%), 
      reactive lymphadenopathy--in 15 (19%), germinogenic tumors--in 3 (4%), 
      sarcoidosis--in 1 (1%). Histologically, LAP was represented by follicular 
      hyperplasia (n = 9), involution (n = 2), bacterial lymphadenitis with necrosis (n = 
      4). CONCLUSION: Biopsy of peripheral lymph nodes is an early, safe, reliable and 
      cost-effective method of LAP diagnosis in patients with AIDS.

TI  - Efficient method for mycobacterial DNA extraction in blood cultures aids rapid PCR 
      identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium.
PG  - 851-4
AB  - The study presented here evaluated the utility of several methods of extracting 
      mycobacterial nucleic acids from positive blood culture samples and examined the 
      effect of each method on the performance of an in-house PCR used directly in the 
      peripheral blood of 80 patients with AIDS to identify Mycobacterium spp. The 
      modified Boom method for extracting DNA from blood cultures proved to be the most 
      efficient, with subsequent PCR analysis yielding 100% positivity (7 samples positive 
      for M. avium and 5 for M. tuberculosis). Only three of 12 patients with a positive 
      blood culture had a PCR result positive for M. avium in peripheral blood. The 
      identification of mycobacteria by PCR in blood culture took about 3 days, reducing 
      the time to diagnosis by several weeks. These results demonstrate that PCR is a 
      sensitive and quick method for identifying mycobacteria, especially when a good DNA 
      extraction method is applied.

AB  - The guinea pig is a very useful animal model for evaluating new tuberculosis 
      candidate vaccines. In addition to established methods for bacterial load 
      determinations, new technologies are emerging that allow us to specifically evaluate 
      effects of vaccines on the pathology of the disease process and the expression by 
      the host of cell mediated immunity. Limitations to the model include housing and 
      related costs, which often contribute to issue with study design and adequate 
      statistical power, and the use of laboratory strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      which lack the high virulence and immune evasion properties of newly emerging 
      clinical isolates.

AB  - Objective: To explore the expression and the clinical diagnostic value of serum 
      miR-21 for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA). Methods: Outpatients and 
      inpatients from the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University were 
      included in the study during June 2014 to September 2015. The IPA group had 40 
      patients, male 22, female 18, aged 55-68 years (mean 60 ), while the control groups 
      included 50 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [male 23, female 27, aged 50-62 
      years (mean 55 )], 50 patients with lung cancer [male 30, female 20, aged 55-70 
      years (mean 62)], and 50 healthy controls [male 25, female 25, aged 50-67 years 
      (mean 60) ]. Serum were obtained and the levels of miR-21 and galactomannan (GM 
      test) and (1, 3)-beta-D-glucan (G test) were measured. The related indexes were 
      analyzed by logistic regression and ROC curves. Results: The serum miR-21 expression 
      in IPA and lung cancer patients were increased, the median values (P(25) and P(75)) 
      being 0.42(0.31, 0.62)and 0.80(0.65, 0.94) respectively, both of which were 
      significantly higher than those of the healthy controls [ 0.09(0.04, 0.15)] and the 
      tuberculosis cases [ 0.08(0.03, 0.16)], P<0.001. The AUCs of miR-21 in IPA group, 
      when compared to healthy controls, tuberculosis cases and lung cancer cases were 
      0.914, 0.897 and 0.863 respectively, with the Youden index being 0.780, 0.700 and 
      0.605 respectively. The serum levels of miR-21 in between 0.198 and 0.723 had 
      preferable diagnostic accuracy. ROC analysis for miR-21 in IPA compared to healthy 
      controls showed that the AUCs of miR-21 combined with G test or GM test were 0.992 
      and 0.966 respectively, the sensitivity being 95% (38/40) and 93% (37/40) 
      respectively, the specificity being 98% (49/50) and 96% (48/50) respectively, and 
      the Youden index being 0.930 and 0.885 respectively. If miR-21 was combined with G 
      test and GM test, the AUC was 0.994, the sensitivity and the specificity being 98% 
      (38/40) and 96% (48/50) respectively, and the Youden index increased to 0.935. ROC 
      analysis for miR-21 in IPA compared to tuberculosis cases showed that when miR-21, G 
      test and GM test were combined, the AUC was 0.984, the sensitivity and the 
      specificity being 98% (38/40) and 90% (45/50) respectively, and the Youden index 
      being 0.875. ROC analysis for miR-21 in IPA compared to lung cancer cases showed 
      that the AUC for miR-21 with G test and miR-21 with GM test were 0.948 and 0.979 
      respectively, the Youden index being 0.725 and 0.895 respectively. When miR-21, G 
      test and GM test were combined, the AUC was 0.998, the sensitivity and the 
      specificity being 100% (40/40) and 98% (49/50) respectively, and the Youden index 
      increased to 0.980. Conclusions: The serum level of miR-21 in IPA and lung cancer 
      patients were significantly elevated. The serum level of miR-21 between 0.198 and 
      0.723 had preferable differential diagnostic accuracy, and therefore miR-21 may be 
      regarded as an independent potential diagnostic serum marker of IPA. The diagnostic 
      efficiency of miR-21 combined with G test and GM test may be more preferable, and 
      remarkably increase the differential diagnosis of IPA from tuberculosis and lung 
      cancer.

TI  - Early vitrectomy and diagnostic testing in severe infectious posterior uveitis and 
      endophthalmitis.
PG  - CR296-300
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the therapeutic and diagnostic value of vitreoretinal 
      surgery in various types of severe viral retinitis and endogenous endophthalmitis. 
      MATERIAL/METHODS: Pars plana vitrectomy with silicon-oil tamponade was performed on 
      12 eyes (12 patients) with severe viral retinitis and endogenous endophthalmitis. 
      The mean age of the patients was 35.2 years (range, 18-56 years). Investigations 
      consisted of chest radiography, RT 23, serology (for toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, 
      herpes simplex virus, and human immunodeficiency virus), and routine blood tests and 
      urinalysis. Examination of vitreous samples consisted of polymerase chain reaction 
      for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and 
      cultures for fungi and bacteria. The results were analyzed 7 days and 6 months after 
      surgery. RESULTS: Analysis of vitreous samples showed cytomegalovirus in 3 patients, 
      herpes simplex virus in 2, tuberculosis in 2, and Candida albicans in 5. All 
      patients had improvement in visual acuity and severity of clinical signs seven days 
      after surgery and in 10 cases after long-term follow-up. Final visual acuity was 
      compromised by chronic macular edema, postinflammatory macular scarring, optic 
      atrophy, subcapsular cataract formation, and capsular opacification after cataract 
      surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Modern laboratory tests are useful for quick and accurate 
      diagnosis of atypical cases of severe infectious posterior uveitis. Early pars plana 
      vitrectomy with silicon oil tamponade is valuable in diagnosing and treating severe 
      infectious posterior uveitis and endophthalmitis.

TI  - A rare case of Cytomegalovirus, Scedosporium apiospermum and Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis in a renal transplant recipient.
PG  - 259
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-14-259 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal transplant recipients are at high risk of developing multiple 
      infections, often concomitantly because of their immunocompromised status. Post 
      renal transplant infections are often elusive and require extensive evaluation for 
      proper diagnosis and treatment. A high index of suspicion is required and an attempt 
      should be made to confirm the microbiological diagnosis from each site involved to 
      rule out multiple infections. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 50-year-old female, a 
      renal allograft recipient who presented with left hemiplegia, esophageal ulcers and 
      fever 3 months after her transplant. Esophageal biopsy revealed Cytomegalovirus 
      (CMV) inclusions and the whole blood quantitative CMV polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) was positive. Neuroimaging showed a brain abscess, stereotactic biopsy from 
      which revealed Scedosporium apiospermum on fungal culture. Her tacrolimus and 
      mycophenolate were stopped and she was managed with intravenous ganciclovir and 
      voriconazole. With these measures, she showed marked improvement in her general and 
      neurological condition. Two months later, she developed recurrence of fever with dry 
      cough. Radiological investigation revealed a cavitating lung lesion, a needle 
      aspiration from which demonstrated acid-fast bacilli. She was started on 
      antituberculous treatment. With these measures, she recovered completely and 
      maintained good graft function despite being on only prednisolone 10 mg once a day. 
      CONCLUSION: Although CMV disease is not uncommon in the first three months post 
      transplant, Scedosporium is a rare cause of brain abscess. On the other hand, 
      tuberculosis is common in transplant recipients, especially in developing countries, 
      like India. However, this is the first case report of occurrence of these three 
      infections in the same patient, demonstrating the importance of a good 
      microbiological work-up from each site involved in immunosuppressed subjects.

      improve uptake and reduce turnaround time.
PG  - 1319616
LID - 10.1080/16549716.2017.1319616 [doi]
LID - 1319616
AB  - BACKGROUND: In collaboration with the national AIDS program, early infant diagnosis 
      (EID) is implemented by Integrated HIV Care (IHC) program through its 
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centers across 10 cities in five states and regions of 
      Myanmar. Blood samples from the ART centers are sent using public transport to a 
      centralized PCR facility. OBJECTIVES: Among HIV-exposed babies <9 months at 
      enrolment into IHC program (2013-15), to describe the EID cascade (enrolment, sample 
      collection for PCR, result receipt by mother, HIV diagnosis and ART initiation) and 
      factors associated with delayed (>8 weeks of age) or no blood sample collection for 
      EID. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study involving record review. A predictive 
      poisson regression model with robust variance estimates was fitted for risk factors 
      of delayed or no sample collection. RESULTS: Of 1349 babies, 523 (39%) of the 
      babies' mothers were on ART before pregnancy. Timely uptake of EID (<8 weeks of age) 
      was 47% (633/1349); sample collection was delayed in 27% (367/1349) and not done in 
      26% (349/1349) babies. Among samples collected (n = 1000), 667 results were received 
      by the mother; 52 (5%) were HIV-infected; among them 42 (81%) were initiated on ART. 
      Median (IQR) turnaround time from sample collection to result receipt by mother and 
      time to initiate ART from result receipt by mother was 7 (4,12) and 8.5 (6,16) 
      weeks, respectively. Mothers not on ART before pregnancy and distance of ART center 
      from PCR facility (more than 128 km) were the risk factors of delayed or no sample 
      collection. CONCLUSIONS: Improving provision of ART to mothers (through universal 
      'test and treat') is urgently required, which has the potential to improve the 
      timely uptake of EID as well. Interventions to reduce turnaround times, like point 
      of care EID testing and/or systematic use of mobile technology to communicate 
      results, are needed.

TI  - Preparation of mycobacterial DNA from blood culture fluids by simple alkali wash and 
      heat lysis method for PCR detection.
PG  - 1985-91
AB  - A sodium iodide-isopropanol (NI) method was compared with an alkali wash and heat 
      lysis (AH) procedure for the preparation and extraction of DNA from BACTEC 13A blood 
      culture fluid samples from AIDS patients for use in a PCR for the detection and 
      identification of mycobacteria. The sensitivity and efficiency of the DNA extraction 
      methods were assessed by a multiplex PCR which detected the members of the genus 
      Mycobacterium and differentiated between M. intracellulare, M. tuberculosis, and M. 
      avium isolates with a limit of detection of between 0.28 pg (67 cells) and 120 pg 
      (28,571 cells) of standard mycobacterial DNA. The PCR amplified mycobacterial DNA 
      prepared by the AH procedure from 40 acid-fast bacillus-positive blood cultures with 
      growth index values of > 20 U but not from 48 blood cultures with growth index 
      values of < 21 U. The AH method was about 10 times more sensitive than the NI method 
      for extracting DNA from 13 acid-fast bacillus-positive BACTEC fluid samples for PCR 
      analysis. The study shows that the AH procedure in combination with the multiplex 
      PCR is a simple, specific, and sensitive method which can be used in the routine 
      diagnostic laboratory to detect and identify different members of the genus 
      Mycobacterium in blood culture fluid samples from AIDS patients.

TI  - Cerebral toxoplasmosis mimicking subacute meningitis in HIV-infected patients; a 
      cohort study from Indonesia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-associated subacute meningitis is mostly caused by tuberculosis or 
      cryptococcosis, but often no etiology can be established. In the absence of CT or 
      MRI of the brain, toxoplasmosis is generally not considered as part of the 
      differential diagnosis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed cerebrospinal 
      fluid real time PCR and serological testing for Toxoplasma gondii in archived 
      samples from a well-characterized cohort of 64 HIV-infected patients presenting with 
      subacute meningitis in a referral hospital in Indonesia. Neuroradiology was only 
      available for 6 patients. At time of presentation, patients mostly had newly 
      diagnosed and advanced HIV infection (median CD4 count 22 cells/mL), with only 17.2% 
      taking ART, and 9.4% PJP-prophylaxis. CSF PCR for T. Gondii was positive in 21 
      patients (32.8%). Circulating toxoplasma IgG was present in 77.2% of patients 
      tested, including all in whom the PCR of CSF was positive for T. Gondii. Clinically, 
      in the absence of neuroradiology, toxoplasmosis was difficult to distinguish from 
      tuberculosis or cryptococcal meningitis, although CSF abnormalities were less 
      pronounced. Mortality among patients with a positive CSF T. Gondii PCR was 81%, 
      2.16-fold higher (95% CI 1.04-4.47) compared to those with a negative PCR. 
      CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Toxoplasmosis should be considered in HIV-infected 
      patients with clinically suspected subacute meningitis in settings where 
      neuroradiology is not available.

TI  - Failure to quantify viral load with two of the three commercial methods in a 
      pregnant woman harboring an HIV type 1 subtype G strain.
PG  - 453-9
AB  - The level of HIV-1 RNA in plasma has become one of the most important markers in the 
      follow-up of HIV-infected patients. Three techniques are commercially available: 
      both the Amplicor HIV Monitor and the NASBA HIV-1 RNA QT are target amplification 
      methods, whereas the Quantiplex HIV RNA assay is a branched DNA signal amplification 
      technique. Detection in both target amplification techniques is based on a single 
      primer pair and a single probe in the gag region, whereas multiple probes capture 
      the pol region of the viral RNA in the branched DNA assay. We investigated the 
      discrepant observation of an undetectable viral load in an immunodeficient pregnant 
      HIV-1-infected patient of African origin with no prior antiretroviral treatment. 
      Although clinical progression was present in this patient with tuberculosis and a 
      low CD4 cell count, viral load determinations with both the Amplicor Monitor and 
      NASBA assays revealed no detectable RNA levels. The presence of HIV-1 RNA in the 
      plasma of the patient was demonstrated by an in-house RNA-PCR. Subsequent HIV-1 RNA 
      quantification with the branched DNA method revealed a high viremia (460,000 
      copies/ml). DNA sequence analysis of the gag gene identified a subtype G HIV-1 
      strain (HIV-1BL). To our knowledge this is the first report of a patient harboring 
      an HIV-1 genotype of the main group with a high viral load as quantified by the 
      branched DNA assay, but undetectable with the two commercial HIV RNA amplification 
      techniques because of genetic divergence. In the case of discrepant low viral loads 
      determined by one amplification technique in patients with advanced clinical stage 
      one should use an alternative quantification technique for confirmation.

TI  - Molecular and cellular profiles of the resolution phase in a damage-associated 
      molecular pattern (DAMP)-mediated peritonitis model and revelation of leukocyte 
      persistence in peritoneal tissues.
PG  - 1914-29
LID - 10.1096/fj.14-259341 [doi]
AB  - Models of microbe-elicited peritonitis have been invaluable to identify mechanisms 
      underlying inflammation resolution, but whether resolution mechanisms differ from an 
      inflammatory agent to another has not been determined. Thus, we analyzed the 
      cellular and molecular components of the resolution phase of non-microbe-induced 
      inflammation. In thioglycollate (TG)-induced peritonitis, resolution started at 12 h 
      (Tmax) and displayed a 22 h resolution interval (Ri). During resolution, lipoxin A4, 
      resolvin (Rv) D1 and RvD2, protectin D1 (PD1), and maresin 1 (MaR1) were transiently 
      produced while RvD5 was continually generated. In addition, docosahexaenoic acid 
      (DHA)-derived mediators were produced to a higher extent than in microbial 
      peritonitis. We also investigated leukocyte infiltration and clearance in peritoneal 
      tissues surrounding the inflammatory site. In the omentum, resolution parameters, 
      neutrophil apoptosis, and efferocytosis were similar to those of the peritoneal 
      cavity. However, we noticed long-term persistence of M2-polarized macrophages and 
      B-lymphocytes in the omentum after TG administration, whereas zymosan injection 
      caused M1/M2-macrophage and T-lymphocyte persistence regardless of the magnitude of 
      the inflammatory response. Our study indicates that some aspects of resolution are 
      shaped in a stimulus-specific manner, and it ultimately argues that the tissues 
      surrounding the inflammatory site must also be considered to address the 
      inflammatory response globally.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of myeloid-related protein 8/14 in mycobacterial 
      infection. METHODS: The mRNA and protein expression levels of MRP8 or MRP14 were 
      measured by real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Role of MRP8/14 was 
      tested by overexpression or RNA interference assays. Flow cytometry and colony 
      forming unit were used to test the phagocytosis and the survival of intracellular 
      Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG), respectively. Autophagy mediated by MRP8/14 was 
      detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence. The colocalization of BCG 
      phagosomes with autophagosomes or lysosomes was by detected by confocal microscopy. 
      ROS production was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: MRP8/14 expressions were 
      up-regulated in human monocytic THP1 cells and primary macrophages after 
      mycobacterial challenge. Silencing of MRP8/14 suppressed bacterial killing, but had 
      no influence on the phagocytosis of BCG. Importantly, silencing MRP8/14 decreased 
      autophagy and BCG phagosome maturation in THP1-derived macrophages, thereby 
      increasing the BCG survival. Additionally, we demonstrated that MRP8/14 promoted 
      autophagy in a ROS-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed a novel 
      role of MRP8/14 in the autophagy-mediated elimination of intracellular BCG by 
      promoting ROS generation, which may provide a promising therapeutic target for 
      tuberculosis and other intracellular bacterial infectious diseases.

TI  - Early inhibition of mycobacterial growth by human alveolar macrophages is not due to 
      nitric oxide.
PG  - 1943-50
AB  - Phagocytic cells provide the first line of defense against mycobacteria. We examined 
      the relative mycobacteriostatic contributions of normal human alveolar macrophages 
      (HAM), peripheral blood monocytes (PBM), and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in 
      the early time period after infection with mycobacteria (48 h). Cells were infected 
      with Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) or M. tuberculosis H37Ra and their ability to inhibit 
      growth was determined by mycobacterial incorporation of [3H]uracil. HAM inhibited 
      the growth of both mycobacteria (44.2 +/- 7.9 and 37.6 +/- 10.5% inhibition, 
      respectively). Two populations of HAM donors were subsequently defined: inhibitors 
      and noninhibitors. The ability to inhibit growth of H37Ra correlated with that of 
      BCG. In contrast to HAM, PBM and PMN did not inhibit mycobacterial growth. Because 
      nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed to mediate growth inhibition in murine models, 
      we examined whether NO was responsible for the early growth inhibition of 
      mycobacteria by HAM. As expected, in murine peritoneal macrophages (MPM) IFN-gamma 
      (2,500 U/ml) enhanced growth inhibition of BCG; the effect was abolished by the 
      nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor NMMA. In contrast, IFN-gamma failed to enhance 
      growth inhibition by HAM or PBM and NMMA had no effect. MPM expressed inducible 
      nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) mRNA in response to LPS and IFN-gamma and produced NO. 
      Neither NOS2 mRNA nor NO could be detected in HAM stimulated with LPS and IFN-gamma 
      or mycobacteria. These data demonstrate that HAM, but not PBM or PMN, have 
      NO-independent mycobacteriostatic activity in the early time period after infection 
      with mycobacteria.

TI  - Failure of PCR to Detect Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue DNA in Blood in Latent 
      Yaws.
PG  - e0003905

LID - e0003905
AB  - Yaws, caused by Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue, is a neglected tropical disease 
      closely related to venereal syphilis and is targeted for eradication by 2020. Latent 
      yaws represents a diagnostic challenge, and current tools cannot adequately 
      distinguish between individuals with true latent infection and individuals who are 
      serofast following successful treatment. PCR on blood has previously been shown to 
      detect T. pallidum DNA in patients with syphilis, suggesting that this approach may 
      be of value in yaws. We performed real-time PCR for Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue 
      on blood samples from 140 children with positive T. pallidum Particle Agglutination 
      (TPPA) and Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) tests and 7 controls (negative serology), all 
      collected as part of a prospective study of yaws in the Solomon Islands. All samples 
      were also tested by a nested PCR for T. pallidum. 12 patients had clinical evidence 
      of active yaws whilst 128 were considered to have latent yaws. 43 children had high 
      titre rapid plasma reagins (RPRs) of ≥1:32. PCR testing with both assays gave 
      negative results in all cases. It is possible that the failure to detect T. pallidum 
      ssp. pertenue in blood reflects lower loads of organism in latent yaws compared to 
      those in latent infection with T. pallidum ssp. pertenue, and/or a lower propensity 
      for haematogenous dissemination in yaws than in syphilis. As the goal of the yaws 
      control programme is eradication, a tool that can differentiate true latent 
      infection from individuals who are serofast would be of value; however, PCR of blood 
      is not that tool.

TI  - Distinct clinical features in nontuberculous mycobacterial disease with or without 
      latent tuberculosis infection.
PG  - 313-9
AB  - Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) diseases are in the face of a progressive increase 
      even in immune-competent subjects, and the clinical features of NTM diseases are 
      heterogenous. The decision to institute treatment of the patients should be made 
      after a period of follow up, because therapy is often prolonged, and frequently 
      ineffective. The reasons why some patients develop severe NTM diseases are not 
      clear. Here we observed the involvement of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in 
      clinical and laboratory features of NTM diseases. We evaluated various 
      tuberculosis-related inflammatory markers including osteopontin (OPN), pentraxin-3 
      (PTX-3), and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) in NTM infected patients with or without 
      LTBI. Eight NTM and 5 tuberculosis (TB) patients, and 5 healthy subjects were 
      enrolled. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis confirmed the absence of 
      tuberculosis specific gene (RD1 region), among clinical isolates from NTM patients. 
      Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA) using Early Secreted Antigenic Target-6 
      (ESAT-6) and CFP-10, the RD1-encoded protein, was employed for determining LTBI. 
      IGRA was positive in 4/8 NTM (NTM with LTBI, 50%) and 5/5 TB patients. Only 2 of 4 
      NTM with LTBI were under chemotherapy among all NTM patients, and others were 
      followed up. The plasma levels of OPN, PTX3 and sIL-2R were significantly higher in 
      NTM patients with LTBI than in those without LTBI (P < 0.05). The two patients under 
      therapy showed the highest OPN levels that persisted after treatment. The increased 
      inflammatory levels in NTM patients with LTBI indicate enhanced inflammatory 
      reaction. Extensive therapy may be necessary in such patients.

AB  - Current diagnostic methods allow a rapid and reliable detection of active human 
      cytomegalovirus (hCMV) infection by identifying the presence of pp65 CMV antigen or 
      CMV DNA in peripheral blood and affected organs. The goal of this study was to 
      evaluate the effectiveness of CMV detection in blood and organ-specific biological 
      material, such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), by comparing two standard 
      diagnostic methods, immunofluorescence (IF) and the real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR). We evaluated 25 patients with concomitant respiratory disease who 
      were referred to our hospital for diagnosis due to suspected acute CMV infection. 
      The presence of hCMV was concomitantly evaluated by IF and PCR in 16 peripheral 
      blood samples. In two patients, we observed positive results for both IF and PCR, 
      and in two other patients the results were discordant. Of 11 patients, CMV DNA was 
      detected in six BALF samples, and in one blood plasma sample. Real-time PCR detected 
      CMV DNA in 54.6 % of BALF samples and 12.0 % of blood samples, while indirect IF 
      testing confirmed antigenemia in 12.5 % of blood samples. The results from our study 
      suggest that the IF method is as effective as PCR for detecting an ongoing CMV 
      infection in blood samples. However, real-time PCR was much more effective at 
      detecting CMV DNA in BALF compared to blood samples. Our results suggest that the 
      biological material being tested during CMV diagnosis should be derived directly 
      from the virally infected organ(s).

TI  - RT-PCR detection of HIV in Republic of Macedonia.
PG  - 350-5
AB  - The aim of the study was to detect HIV RNA in seropositive patients using RT-PCR 
      method and thus, to establish PCR methodology in the routine laboratory works. The 
      total of 33 examined persons were divided in two groups: 1) 13 persons seropositive 
      for HIV; and 2) 20 healthy persons - randomly selected blood donors that made the 
      case control group. The subjects age was between 25 and 52 years (average 38,5). 
      ELFA test for combined detection of HIV p24 antigen and anti HIV-1+2 IgG and ELISA 
      test for detection of antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2, were performed for each 
      examined person. RNA from the whole blood was extracted using a commercial kit based 
      on salt precipitation. Detection of HIV RNA was performed using RT-PCR kit. 
      Following nested PCR, the product was separated by electrophoresis in 1,5 % agarose 
      gel. The result was scored positive if the band of 210bp was visible regardless of 
      intensity. Measures of precaution were taken during all the steps of the work and 
      HIV infected materials were disposed of accordingly. In the group of blood donors 
      ELFA, ELISA and RT-PCR were negative. Assuming that prevalence of HIV infection is 
      zero, the clinical specificity of RT-PCR is 100 %. The analytical specificity of 
      RT-PCR method was tested against Hepatitis C and B, Human Papiloma Virus, 
      Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus, Rubella Virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
      Chlamydia trachomatis. None of these templates yielded amplicon. In the group of 13 
      seropositive persons, 33 samples were analyzed. HIV RNA was detected in 15 samples. 
      ELISA and ELFA test were positive in all samples. Different aliquots of the samples 
      were tested independently and showed the same results. After different periods of 
      storing the RNA samples at -70 masculineC, RT-PCR reaction was identical to the one 
      performed initially. The obtained amplicons were maintained frozen at -20 masculineC 
      for a week and the subsequently performed electrophoresis was identical to the 
      previous one. The reaction is fast, simple for manipulation; with low detection 
      level of 60 IU/ml. RT-PCR needs a small amount of RNA, as well as a small volume of 
      sample. HIV RNA was detected in different periods of time with different clinical 
      presentations in patients, with or without antiretroviral therapy. RT-PCR method 
      gives the opportunity for reliable determination of HIV-1 RNA with border of 
      detection of 60 IU/ml. The test is reproducible and has high analytical and clinical 
      specificity.

TI  - PCR assay based on DNA coding for 16S rRNA for detection and identification of 
      mycobacteria in clinical samples.
PG  - 3225-33
AB  - A PCR and a reverse cross blot hybridization assay were developed for the detection 
      and identification of mycobacteria in clinical samples. The PCR amplifies a part of 
      the DNA coding for 16S rRNA with a set of primers that is specific for the genus 
      Mycobacterium and that flanks species-specific sequences within the genes coding for 
      16S rRNA. The PCR product is analyzed in a reverse cross blot hybridization assay 
      with probes specific for M. tuberculosis complex (pTub1), M. avium (pAvi3), M. 
      intracellulare (pInt5 and pInt7), M. kansasii complex-M. scrofulaceum complex 
      (pKan1), M. xenopi (pXen1), M. fortuitum (pFor1), M. smegmatis (pSme1), and 
      Mycobacterium spp. (pMyc5a). The PCR assay can detect 10 fg of DNA, the equivalent 
      of two mycobacteria. The specificities of the probes were tested with 108 
      mycobacterial strains (33 species) and 31 nonmycobacterial strains (of 17 genera). 
      The probes pAvi3, pInt5, pInt7, pKan1, pXen1, and pMyc5a were specific. With probes 
      pTub1, pFor1, and pSme1, slight cross hybridization occurred. However, the 
      mycobacterial strains from which the cross-hybridizing PCR products were derived 
      belonged to nonpathogenic or nonopportunistic species which do not occur in clinical 
      samples. The test was used on 31 different clinical specimens obtained from patients 
      suspected of having mycobacterial disease, including a patient with a double 
      mycobacterial infection. The samples included sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tissue 
      biopsy samples, cerebrospinal fluid, pus, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, and 
      blood. The results of the PCR assay agreed with those of conventional identification 
      methods or with clinical data, showing that the test can be used for the direct and 
      rapid detection and identification of mycobacteria in clinical samples.

TI  - Human {beta}-defensin 2 is expressed and associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      during infection of human alveolar epithelial cells.
PG  - 4505-11
AB  - To determine the role of human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) in human tuberculosis, we 
      studied the in vitro induction of HBD-2 gene expression by Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis H37Rv infection in the human lung epithelial cell line A549, in 
      alveolar macrophages (AM), and in blood monocytes (MN) by reverse transcription-PCR. 
      We also studied the induction of HBD-2 gene expression by mannose lipoarabinomannan 
      (manLAM) from M. tuberculosis. Intracellular production of HBD-2 peptide was 
      detected by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy. Our results demonstrated 
      that there was induction of HBD-2 mRNA in A549 cells after infection with M. 
      tuberculosis at various multiplicities of infection (MOI) and that there was 
      stimulation with manLAM. AM expressed the HBD-2 gene only at a high MOI with M. 
      tuberculosis. MN did not express HBD-2 at any of the experimental M. tuberculosis 
      MOI. Immunostaining revealed the presence of intracellular HBD-2 peptide in A549 
      cells following infection with M. tuberculosis, and the staining was more intense in 
      areas where there were M. tuberculosis clusters. By using electron microscopy we 
      also demonstrated production of HBD-2 after M. tuberculosis infection and adherence 
      of HBD-2 to the membranes of M. tuberculosis. Alveolar epithelial cells are among 
      the first cells to encounter M. tuberculosis following aerogenic infection. As HBD-2 
      has been shown to control growth of M. tuberculosis and has chemotactic activity, 
      our results suggest that HBD-2 induction by M. tuberculosis may have a role in the 
      pathogenesis of human tuberculosis.

TI  - Detection of bacillus Calmette-Guerin in the blood by the polymerase chain reaction 
      method of treated bladder cancer patients.
PG  - 2109-12
AB  - PURPOSE: Following intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) instillation, we 
      attempted to detect BCG in the blood using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      method and correlate these findings with the occurrence of major complications due 
      to this treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intravesical BCG immunotherapy was given 
      to 22 consecutive patients with superficial bladder tumors. In 2 patients the BCG 
      instillation had to be discontinued due to serious side effects of therapy. Blood 
      samples (252 aliquots) were obtained from 126 BCG courses in 22 cases, and 2 
      additional samples (4 aliquots) were obtained from 1 patient 1 and 3 months after 
      cessation of therapy. All blood samples were analyzed by the PCR technique for 
      detection of deoxyribonucleic acid tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis. RESULTS: 
      Of the 126 blood samples 9 (7.1%) were PCR positive for M. tuberculosis. These 9 
      positive samples belonged to 3 patients, all of whom were among those 4 patients who 
      had major clinical side effects. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that rapid and 
      sensitive detection of mycobacteremia by PCR correlated with the clinical course of 
      these patients. We also demonstrated that PCR can be used to monitor BCG in the 
      blood after antituberculous therapy. The early, fast and accurate diagnosis of BCG 
      in the blood by PCR may alter the serious clinical course of these patients by 
      initiation of specific treatment early. However, further extensive studies are 
      needed to validate these results.

      treatment.

AB  - Sustained elimination of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) requires the reduction and 
      control of parasite reservoirs to minimize the transmission of Leishmania donovani 
      infection. A simple, reproducible and definitive diagnostic procedure is therefore 
      indispensable for the early and accurate detection of parasites in VL, Relapsed VL 
      (RVL) and Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients, all of whom are 
      potential reservoirs of Leishmania parasites. To overcome the limitations of current 
      diagnostic approaches, a novel quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (qPCR) method based on Taqman chemistry was devised for the detection and 
      quantification of L. donovani in blood and skin. The diagnostic efficacy was 
      evaluated using archived peripheral blood buffy coat DNA from 40 VL, 40 PKDL, 10 
      RVL, 20 cured VL, and 40 cured PKDL along with 10 tuberculosis (TB) cases and 80 
      healthy endemic controls. Results were compared to those obtained using a 
      Leishmania-specific nested PCR (Ln-PCR). The real time PCR assay was 100% (95% CI, 
      91.19-100%) sensitive in detecting parasite genomes in VL and RVL samples and 85.0% 
      (95% CI, 70.16-94.29%) sensitive for PKDL samples. In contrast, the sensitivity of 
      Ln-PCR was 77.5% (95% CI, 61.55-89.16%) for VL samples, 100% (95%CI, 69.15-100%) for 
      RVL samples, and 52.5% (95% CI, 36.13-68.49%) for PKDL samples. There was 
      significant discordance between the two methods with the overall sensitivity of the 
      qPCR assay being considerably higher than Ln-PCR. None of the assay detected L. 
      donovani DNA in buffy coats from cured VL cases, and reduced infectious burdens were 
      demonstrated in cured PKDL cases who remained positive in 7.5% (3/40) and 2.5% 
      (1/40) cases by real-time PCR and Ln-PCR, respectively. Both assays were 100% (95% 
      CI, 95.98-100) specific with no positive signals in either endemic healthy control 
      or TB samples. The real time PCR assay we developed offers a molecular tool for 
      accurate detection of circulating L. donovani parasites in VL, PKDL and RVL 
      patients, as well as being capable of assessing response to treatment. As such, this 
      real time PCR assay represents an important contribution in efforts to eliminate VL.

AB  - In vivo and in vitro tests are the two major ways of identifying the triggering 
      allergens in sensitized individuals with allergic symptoms. Both methods are equally 
      significant in terms of sensitivity and specificity. However, in certain 
      circumstances, in vitro methods are highly preferred because they circumvent the use 
      of sensitizing drugs in patients. In current study, we described a highly sensitive 
      immuno-PCR (iPCR) assay for serum IgE specific to Bermuda allergens. Using 
      oligonucleotide-labelled antibody, we used iPCR for the sensitive detection of serum 
      IgE. The nucleotide sequence was amplified using conventional PCR and the bands were 
      visualized on 2.5% agarose gel. Results demonstrated a 100-fold enhancement in 
      sensitivity of iPCR over commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      (ELISA) kit. Our iPCR method was highly sensitive for Bermuda-specific serum IgE and 
      could be beneficial in allergy clinics.

TI  - Laboratory-based diagnosis of brucellosis--a review of the literature. Part I: 
      Techniques for direct detection and identification of Brucella spp.
PG  - 487-505
AB  - Brucellosis is a world-wide re-emerging zoonosis and the most frequent 
      laboratory-acquired bacterial infection, causing severe disease in humans with 
      unspecific clinical signs affecting numerous organs. Contact with infected animals, 
      ingestion of contaminated animal products and handling of Brucella isolates in 
      laboratories are risk factors. Various other febrile illnesses, e.g. malaria, 
      tuberculosis, typhoid fever and tularemia may present with the same symptoms. 
      Therefore, clinical diagnosis is difficult to establish but effective therapy 
      requires an early diagnosis. Vaccines for humans are still not commercially 
      available. Blood culturing of Brucella is time-consuming and not reliable. Thus 
      diagnosis is usually based on indirect serological tests, i.e. serum agglutination 
      test, complement fixation or the Coombs test. However, these 'conventional' 
      serological tests lack sensitivity and specificity. Hence, a combination of various 
      tests is mandatory for a definite diagnosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays can 
      be used for screening and confirmation of brucellosis in one step. Molecular 
      techniques like the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism are needed to differentiate species and strains within the genus 
      Brucella. This review will summarize advantages and disadvantages of the techniques 
      used in clinical laboratories for direct detection and identification of Brucella 
      spp.

TI  - Selection by two powerful antigens may account for the presence of the major 
      population of human peripheral gamma/delta T cells.
PG  - 1311-22
AB  - V gamma 9/V delta 2 cells represent a fraction of human gamma/delta cells that is 
      expanded after birth in the periphery, carries markers of activated cells, and 
      becomes a major population in peripheral blood. We found that these cells do not 
      comprise a single population but actually represent two nested sets, the smaller of 
      which, specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis-pulsed antigen-presenting cells 
      (APC), is contained in a larger set specific for an antigen found on the Molt-4 
      lymphoma. The larger set, representing 40-80% of all blood gamma/delta cells, is 
      comprised of cells bearing the V gamma 9/C gamma 1 chain. Cells in the smaller, 
      included set have an additional requirement for V delta 2 (and probably for certain 
      permissive junctional regions, since a very small percentage of V gamma 9/V delta 2 
      cells do not react against mycobacteria-pulsed APC). Optimal stimulation by 
      mycobacteria is dependent on the presence of APC, and is not restricted by classical 
      major histocompatibility complex molecules. Some of the V gamma 9/V delta 2 
      mycobacteria-specific clones are also stimulated by APC pulsed with different 
      bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli, indicating that the 
      population includes several different patterns of reactivity. These data establish a 
      relationship in humans between specificity and V gamma/V delta gene usage, and offer 
      an explanation for the peripheral expansion of these gamma/delta cells.

TI  - Rapid DNA extraction protocol for detection of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency from 
      dried blood spots by real-time PCR.
PG  - 29-37
LID - 10.1007/978-94-007-4549-0_5 [doi]
AB  - The dried blood spot (DBS) specimens have been successfully employed for the 
      large-scale diagnostics of α1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency as an easy to collect and 
      transport alternative to plasma/serum. In the present study we propose a fast, 
      efficient, and cost effective protocol of DNA extraction from dried blood spot (DBS) 
      samples that provides sufficient quantity and quality of DNA and effectively 
      eliminates any natural PCR inhibitors, allowing for successful AAT genotyping by 
      real-time PCR and direct sequencing. DNA extracted from 84 DBS samples from chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease patients was genotyped for AAT deficiency variants by 
      real-time PCR. The results of DBS AAT genotyping were validated by serum IEF 
      phenotyping and AAT concentration measurement. The proposed protocol allowed 
      successful DNA extraction from all analyzed DBS samples. Both quantity and quality 
      of DNA were sufficient for further real-time PCR and, if necessary, for genetic 
      sequence analysis. A 100% concordance between AAT DBS genotypes and serum phenotypes 
      in positive detection of two major deficiency S- and Z- alleles was achieved. Both 
      assays, DBS AAT genotyping by real-time PCR and serum AAT phenotyping by IEF, 
      positively identified PI*S and PI*Z allele in 8 out of the 84 (9.5%) and 16 out of 
      84 (19.0%) patients, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed protocol noticeably 
      reduces the costs and the hand-on-time of DBS samples preparation providing genomic 
      DNA of sufficient quantity and quality for further real-time PCR or genetic sequence 
      analysis. Consequently, it is ideally suited for large-scale AAT deficiency 
      screening programs and should be method of choice.

TI  - The diagnosis of two cases of cutaneous ulcer caused by infection with Mycobacterium 
      haemophilum: direct identification in a clinical sample by polymerase chain 
      reaction-restriction endonuclease analysis.
PG  - 820-3
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2008.03702.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium haemophilum was first recovered from subcutaneous lesions 
      of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. Because of its special growth requirements (it 
      grows at 30-32 degrees C and requires iron-supplemented medium), the organism cannot 
      be isolated using routine culture techniques for other mycobacteria. Only a few 
      developed countries have reported infection with this mycobacterium. We report the 
      first two cases diagnosed in Venezuela. METHODS: The diagnosis of the first case was 
      established using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction endonuclease analysis 
      of the gene encoding the 65-kDa heat shock protein (hsp65) for the direct 
      identification of M. haemophilum in a clinical specimen in which bacilli were 
      observed on acid-fast smear, but growth was not detected by standard culture 
      procedures. RESULTS: After recognizing this bacterium as a possible cause of 
      infection in our setting, clinical samples of cutaneous lesions were routinely 
      cultured on blood agar at 30 degrees C for at least 6 weeks, which resulted in the 
      diagnosis of the second case. CONCLUSIONS: Dermatologists should consider this 
      bacterium in immunocompromised patients with cutaneous ulcerating lesions. Material 
      from the lesions can be screened for mycobacteria using an acid-fast stain and, if 
      acid-fast bacilli are seen, PCR analysis of mycobacterial hsp65 can be an effective 
      tool for early diagnosis. Appropriate culture methods are required for bacteriologic 
      confirmation of infection with M. haemophilum.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of the automated COBAS AMPLICOR MTB assay for testing 
      respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens.
PG  - 2853-60
AB  - We evaluated the COBAS AMPLICOR PCR system (Roche Diagnostics) for the routine 
      detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in clinical specimens. 
      Diagnostic culture, considered as the reference method, was performed with BACTEC, 
      Löwenstein-Jensen, Stonebrink, and Kirchner media. Occasionally MB-Redox, ESP, or 
      MGIT medium was also used. A total of 643 respiratory and 506 nonrespiratory 
      specimens collected from 807 patients were investigated. Of the 95 culture-positive 
      specimens, 80 were COBAS AMPLICOR MTB positive, and of the 1,054 culture-negative 
      specimens, 1,044 were COBAS AMPLICOR MTB negative. After resolving discrepancies by 
      review of the medical history, the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive 
      and negative predictive values for the COBAS AMPLICOR MTB assay, respectively, were 
      83.5, 98.8, 86.7, and 98.6% compared to those of diagnostic culture. In 
      smear-positive specimens, the sensitivity of the COBAS AMPLICOR MTB assay was 96%, 
      versus 48% for smear-negative specimens. No significant differences in the test 
      performance between respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens were observed. The 
      overall inhibition rate was less than 2%, excluding stool specimens. The clear 
      advantages of the COBAS AMPLICOR PCR system are standardized procedures and reagents 
      for specimen processing as well as an internal control for reliable monitoring of 
      PCR inhibitors. By simplifying the work flow through a completely automated 
      amplification and amplicon detection procedure, the COBAS AMPLICOR PCR system proved 
      itself as a very useful component for routine diagnostic procedures.

AB  - Melioidosis, a syndrome with protean clinical manifestations, is caused by 
      Gram-negative soil saprophyte Burkholderiapseudomallei Among its diverse clinical 
      presentations, the involvement of spine is a rare phenomenon and can mimic 
      tuberculosis on presentation. A 65-year-old female with a known case of diabetes 
      presented with fever with lower back pain. Blood culture grew Staphylococcus aureus, 
      and as per sensitivity report, clindamycin and cefazolin were started. X-ray and MRI 
      lumbosacral spine showed spondylodiscitis (likely Koch's). Decompression and biopsy 
      were done, and a sample was sent for microbiological investigations that showed no 
      growth of any significant pathogen; furthermore, all tests for tuberculosis 
      diagnosis also remained negative. Active Melioidosis Detect Lateral Flow Assay was 
      used on the tissue sample, which was positive for B. pseudomallei Capsular 
      Polysaccharide (CPS) antigen; the case was confirmed by typethree secretion system 1 
      PCR for melioidosis. Antibiotics were changed to parenteral ceftazidime for 2 weeks 
      followed by oral cotrimoxazole. A dedicated team of microbiologists and physicians 
      is required to identify and treat the disease.

AB  - In order to better understand the immunoregulation following Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis infection, cytokine mRNA induction in response to in vitro infection of 
      human monocytes with live virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv cocultured with autologous 
      lymphocytes was quantitated by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Induced levels of 
      interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and gamma 
      interferon (IFN-gamma) were compared among groups of individuals representing three 
      phases of immunity to infection with M. tuberculosis: naive normal control subjects, 
      purified protein derivative (PPD)-reactive normal donors, and individuals with 
      active tuberculosis (TB [diseased]). Levels of IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor 
      alpha mRNA in cocultured cells from TB patients were 51 and 45%, respectively, of 
      those obtained in cells from sensitized healthy volunteers and were comparable to 
      those from naive normal donors. Lymphoproliferative responses to M. tuberculosis and 
      induction of the T-cell cytokine IL-2 were predictably high in the cells of 
      PPD-sensitized donors, low in normal naive individuals, and variable among TB 
      patients. In contrast, the induced level of another lymphokine, IFN-gamma, did not 
      follow the pattern seen in IL-2 induction. Infection with live M. tuberculosis 
      induced high levels of IFN-gamma mRNA in lymphocytes of both PPD-sensitized and 
      normal naive donors compared with those of TB patients. Interestingly, polyclonal 
      stimulation with the mitogen concanavalin A induced similar IFN-gamma levels in 
      cells from all three donor groups. The high level of IFN-gamma induced by the 
      infection of monocytes from naive normal donors suggests a role for natural killer 
      (NK) cells in the production of IFN-gamma in this coculture system. This response 
      appears independent of the role performed by T cells.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major threat to human health. Due to the 
      limited accuracy of the current TB diagnostic tests, it is critical to determine 
      novel biomarkers for this disease. Circulating exosomes have been used as diagnostic 
      biomarkers in various diseases. OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: In this pilot study, we 
      examined the expression of miRNAs as biomarker candidates for the diagnosis of TB 
      infection. METHODS: Serum-derived exosomes were isolated from TB patients and 
      matched control subjects. The expression of miR-484, miR-425, and miR-96 was 
      examined by RT-PCR methods. RESULTS: The expression of miR-484, miR-425, and miR-96 
      were significantly increased in serum of TB patients which correlated with the TB 
      infection level. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed the 
      diagnostic potency of each individual serum exosomal miRNA with an area under the 
      curve (AUC) = 0.72 for miR-484 (p < 0.05), 0.66 for miR-425 (p < 0.05), and 0.62 for 
      miR-96 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that exosomal miRNAs have 
      diagnostic potential in active tuberculosis. The diagnostic power may be improved 
      when combined with conventional diagnostic markers.

TI  - [Agranulocytosis due to anti-tuberculosis drugs including isoniazid (INH) and 
      rifampicin (RFP)--a report of four cases and review of the literature].
PG  - 683-9
AB  - We experienced 4 cases of agranulocytosis due to anti-tuberculosis drugs (rifampicin 
      [RFP], isoniazid [INH], ethambutol [EB], streptomycin [SM] or pyrazinamide [PZA]) 
      among some 6,400 tuberculosis patients who underwent chemotherapy over the past 20 
      years from 1981 to 2002 in our hospital, and the incidence rate of agranulocytosis 
      was estimated at 0.06%. The 4 cases of agranulocytosis were as follows. CASE 1: A 
      51-year-old woman with right chest pain and fever was admitted to our hospital on 
      Jan 4, 2001. The white blood cell (WBC) count was 5,200/microliter. The tubercle 
      bacilli were cultured in her sputum. The treatment with INH 0.3, RFP 0.45, EB 0.75, 
      PZA 1.2 g/day, allopurinol and teprenone was started on Jan 13. Pyrazinamide and 
      allopurinol were stopped because of hyper-uric acidemia on Feb 7. Agranulocytosis 
      and eosinophilia (WBC 1,300 [Neut 1%, Ly 57%, Eos 35%]) developed on Feb 13. All 
      drugs were withdrawn and G-CSF drug nartograstim 100 micrograms was injected 
      subcutaneously for 3 days. The WBC recovered to normal level and she was thereafter 
      treated with INH, EB and Levofloxacin (LVFX) without any further trouble. 
      Agranulocytosis in this case was supposed to be due to RFP. CASE 2: A 66-year-old 
      man who had had nephrotic syndrome and hypothyroidism and has been treated with 
      prednisolone 10 mg/day was admitted to our hospital on Aug 9, 2000 because of 
      miliary tuberculosis. The tubercle bacilli were cultured in his sputum and the 
      treatment with INH 0.3, RFP 0.45, and EB 0.75 g/day were started on Aug 10, but it 
      was withdrawn on Aug 17 because of general skin eruption. After re-starting 
      treatment with EB and INH on Aug 24, RFP was added in small dosage (0.05 g) on Oct 
      12, but agranulomatosis (WBC 2,300/microliter [Neut 2%]) developed on Nov 21, and 
      all drugs were withdrawn again. The G-CSF drug filgrastim was used once 
      subcutaneously, and WBC recovered immediately. He was thereafter treated with INH, 
      EB, LVFX successfully. Agranulocytosis was supposed to be due to RFP. CASE 3: A 
      60-year-old woman without symptoms had abnormal chest roentgenograph, and consulted 
      with our hospital on Aug 26, 2002. The broncho-alveolar lavage fluid was smear and 
      culture-negative, but PCR-TB positive, and the case was diagnosed as pulmonary 
      tuberculosis. Treatment with INH 0.3, RFP 0.45, EB 0.75, PZA 1.2 g/day, alloprinol 
      300 mg and rebamipide 300 mg/day was started on Sept. 5, 2002. Late in September, 
      she complained of appetite loss. The laboratory data on Oct 3 revealed WBC 
      900/microliter (Neut 1%, Ly 94%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 199 IU/l, and 
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 253 IU/l, showing agranulocytosis and drug-induced 
      hepatitis. The chemotherapy was immediately withdrawn and she was admitted to our 
      hospital on the next day. Glycyrrhizin derivative (SNMC) 40 ml was injected for 5 
      days, and WBC recovered, and AST and ALT also became normal. CASE 4: A 60-year-old 
      man was admitted to our hospital on March 11, 1981 because pulmonary tuberculosis 
      had recurred. He had been treated with SM, PAS and INH in 1973 for pulmonary 
      tuberculosis. On admission examination of blood count and blood chemistry were 
      normal. Treatment with RFP, INH and SM was started on March 11. He stopped out from 
      the hospital on April 17, but in a few days he returned back with sore throat, lower 
      lip swelling and gingival bleeding. Blood cell count on April 24 showed pancytopenia 
      with RBC 226, Hb 7.5, WBC 800 (Ly 96%, Eos 4%) and Plt 10,000/microliter. The 
      bone-marrow showed NCC (nuceated cell count) of 5,500, and megakaryocyte 0. 
      Thereafter ground glass appearance shadows were seen on the whole lung field, and he 
      died May 26. Autopsy showed generalized aspergillosis. It was strongly suspected 
      that either of RFP, INH or SM was responsible for his pancytopenia. We collected 
      another 10 cases of agranulocytosis due to anti-tuberculosis drugs in the world wide 
      literature, and found men/women ratio 5/8 (in one case gender was not known), the 
      duration of chemotherapy before appearance of agranulocytosis 1-3 months, no change 
      in the lymphocyte count of the peripheral blood, and the accompanying of another 
      allergic signs such as skin eruption, blood eosinophilia or drug-induced hepatitis 
      in some cases, and these findings suggest that the mechanism of agranulocytosis due 
      to anti-tuberculosis drugs was allergic in nature.

AB  - Human T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) pair in millions of combinations to create 
      complex and unique T cell repertoires for each person. Through the use of tetramers 
      to analyze TCRs reactive to the antigen-presenting molecule CD1b, we detected T 
      cells with highly stereotyped TCR α-chains present among genetically unrelated 
      patients with tuberculosis. The germline-encoded, mycolyl lipid-reactive (GEM) TCRs 
      had an α-chain bearing the variable (V) region TRAV1-2 rearranged to the joining (J) 
      region TRAJ9 with few nontemplated (N)-region additions. Analysis of TCRs by 
      high-throughput sequencing, binding and crystallography showed linkage of TCRα 
      sequence motifs to high-affinity recognition of antigen. Thus, the CD1-reactive TCR 
      repertoire is composed of at least two compartments: high-affinity GEM TCRs, and 
      more-diverse TCRs with low affinity for CD1b-lipid complexes. We found high 
      interdonor conservation of TCRs that probably resulted from selection by a 
      nonpolymorphic antigen-presenting molecule and an immunodominant antigen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early infant diagnosis of HIV is crucial for timely initiation of 
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) in infected children who are at high risk of mortality. 
      Early infant diagnosis with dried blood spot testing was provided by the National 
      AIDS Programme in Thailand from 2007. We report ART initiation and vital status in 
      children with HIV after 7 years of rollout in Thailand. METHODS: Dried blood spot 
      samples were collected from HIV-exposed children in hospitals in Thailand and mailed 
      to the Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, where HIV DNA 
      was assessed with real-time PCR to establish HIV infection. We linked data from 
      children with an HIV infection to the National AIDS Programme database to ascertain 
      ART and vital status. FINDINGS: Between April 5, 2007, and Oct 1, 2014, 16 046 dried 
      blood spot samples were sent from 8859 children in 364 hospitals in Thailand. Median 
      age at first dried blood spot test was 2·1 (IQR 1·8-2·5) months. Of 7174 (81%) 
      children with two or more samples, 223 (3%) were HIV positive (including five 
      unconfirmed). Of 1685 (19%) children with one sample, 70 (4%) were unconfirmed 
      positive. Of 293 (3%) children who were HIV positive, 220 (75%) registered for HIV 
      care and 170 (58%) initiated ART. Median age at ART initiation decreased from 14·2 
      months (IQR 10·2-25·6) in 2007 to 6·1 months (4·2-9·2) in 2013, and the number of 
      children initiating ART aged younger than 1 year increased from five (33%) of 15 
      children initiating ART in 2007 to ten (83%) of 12 initiating ART in 2013. 15 (9%) 
      of 170 children who initiated ART died and 16 (32%) of 50 who had no ART record 
      died. INTERPRETATION: Early infant diagnosis with dried blood spot testing had high 
      uptake in primary care settings. Further improvement of linkage to HIV care is 
      needed to ensure timely treatment of all children with an HIV infection. FUNDING: 
      None.

TI  - Hypervirulent M. tuberculosis W/Beijing strains upregulate type I IFNs and increase 
      expression of negative regulators of the Jak-Stat pathway.
PG  - 694-701
AB  - The role of type I interferons (IFNs) in the host response to bacterial infections 
      is controversial. Here, we examined the role of IFN-alpha/beta in the murine 
      response to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, using wildtype mice, mice 
      with impaired signaling through the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR), and mice treated to 
      reduce levels of type I IFNs. In this study, we used virulent clinical isolates of 
      M. tuberculosis, including HN878, W4, and CDC1551. Our results indicate that higher 
      levels of type I IFNs are induced by the HN878 and W4 strains. Induction of type I 
      IFNs was associated with lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and 
      interleukin- 12 (IL-12) and reduced T cell activation, and associated with decreased 
      survival of the mice infected with HN878 or W4 relative to infection with CDC1551. 
      Infection of mice with HN878 and W4 was also associated with relatively higher 
      levels of mRNA for a number of negative regulators of the Jak-Stat signaling 
      pathway, such as suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1, 4, and 5, CD45, protein 
      inhibitor of activated Stat1 (PIAS1), protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 
      1 (Ptpn1), and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type substrate 1 (Ptpns1). 
      Taken together, these results suggest that increased type I IFNs may be deleterious 
      for survival of M. tuberculosis-infected mice in association with reduced Th1 
      immunity.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Case report. OBJECTIVE: To illustrate the usefulness of broad-range 
      bacterial polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing in osteoarticular infections by 
      Capnocytophaga canimorsus. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: C. canimorsus is a 
      gram-negative bacillus that was first identified in 1976. It is a normal inhabitant 
      of the oral mucosa of dogs (26%) and cats (15%). The main clinical patterns are 
      septicemia, which may cause fatal septic shock (in 30% of cases) but arthritis and 
      discitis are possible. C. canimorsus is susceptible to many antimicrobials including 
      β-lactam antibiotics. METHODS: About a case report of 54-year-old man transferred to 
      our institution for discitis, we discuss about PCR for C. canimorsus discitis 
      diagnosis. RESULTS: At admission, the only abnormal physical finding was global pain 
      and stiffness of the lumbar spine. Radiographs of the lumbar spine and pelvis showed 
      lumbar spondylosis, degenerative disc disease, and previously known degenerative 
      facet joint disease. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated L3-L4 discitis with damage 
      to both vertebrae and adjacent discs. Findings were negative from blood and urine 
      cultures, serological tests for the HIV and brucellosis, and sputum tests for 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A percutaneous biopsy of the L3-L4 disc was performed 
      but the bacteriological studies recovered no organisms. A second needle biopsy was 
      performed for broad-range 16S rDNA PCR testing, which identified C. canimorsus. 
      CONCLUSION: Broad-range PCR provided the microbiological diagnosis of 
      culture-negative discitis in our patient. Broad-range PCR should be considered in 
      patients with culture-negative osteoarticular infections.

AB  - Incubation by means of the growth-promoting factor VCG of autoclaved culture broth 
      of M. bovis 8 and tuberculins on the nutrient medium VCG gave rise to microorganisms 
      that could partially restore acid resistance. The isolates reacted with antiserum to 
      M. bovis Vallee in the agglutination test and enzyme immunoassay, which in 
      combination with polymerase chain reaction data verifies their genetic relationship 
      with the pathogen of tuberculosis. The isolates did not show a significant 
      pathogenicity, but they long persisted in guinea-pigs and, in some cases, induced 
      delayed hypersensitivity to tuberculin. When exposed to high temperatures, the 
      pathogen of tuberculosis is presumably to form structures that are capable to 
      restore viability under certain conditions (for example, on the VCG medium).

TI  - Real-time PCR in infectious uveitis as an alternative diagnosis.
PG  - 258-61
LID - S0004-27492011000400006 [pii]
AB  - PURPOSE: Uveitis is a major visual impairment disease affecting parts or the entire 
      uveal tract and occasionally the sclera, the cornea or the optic nerve. The disease 
      is a major cause of ocular morbidity and blindness in immunocompetent and 
      immunocompromised patients. In this work we analyzed the sensitivity and specificity 
      of real-time PCR to detect the etiological agent from blood, plasma, vitreous and 
      aqueous humor and compared with the diagnostic hypothesis. METHODS: Twenty-seven 
      patients (13 male) were studied and Real-time PCR method was used for the detection 
      of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), varicella zoster 
      virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and Toxoplasma 
      gondii (Toxo) in the aqueous humor as well as in the vitreous, blood and plasma. 
      RESULTS: Our results showed the presence of Toxo, CMV, VZV or HSV-2 in 19.2% of 
      aqueous humor samples, and in 30% of vitreous humor samples. In plasma and blood 
      samples, only CMV was detected (11.1% and 3.7%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Real-time 
      PCR was able to detect and to confirm diagnostic hypothesis in uveitis. Our data 
      also confirms that vitreous humor is the best source for molecular diagnosis of 
      infectious uveitis but indicates aqueous humor samples that are easier to obtain may 
      also be appropriate to be tested by Real-time PCR.

      reach this goal. Recent comparative genomics have revealed the presence of 165 M. 
      leprae genes with no homologue in M. tuberculosis. We selected 17 of these genes for 
      further study. All 17 genes were found to be expressed at the mRNA level in M. 
      leprae from infected mice and from a multibacillary leprosy patient. Additional 
      comparative genomic analyses of all currently available mycobacterial genome 
      databases confirmed 12 candidate genes to be unique to M. leprae, whereas 5 genes 
      had homologues in mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis. Evaluation of the 
      immunogenicity of all 17 recombinant proteins in PBMC from 127 Brazilians showed 
      that five antigens (ML0576, ML1989, ML1990, ML2283, and ML2567) induced significant 
      gamma interferon levels in paucibacillary leprosy patients, reactional leprosy 
      patients, and exposed healthy controls but not in most multibacillary leprosy 
      patients, tuberculosis patients, or endemic controls. Importantly, among exposed 
      healthy controls 71% had no detectable immunoglobulin M antibodies to the M. 
      leprae-specific PGL-I but responded to one or more M. leprae antigen(s). 
      Collectively, the M. leprae proteins identified are expressed at the transcriptome 
      level and can efficiently activate T cells of M. leprae-exposed individuals. These 
      proteins may provide new tools to develop tests for specific diagnosis of M. leprae 
      infection and may enhance our understanding of leprosy and its transmission.

AB  - We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of a nested-polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) method for detection of Mycobacterium leprae DNA from whole blood. Whole-blood 
      specimens were subjected to nested-PCR amplification of M. leprae repeat DNA 
      sequences in 49 multibacillary (MB) and 30 paucibacillary (PB) leprosy patients, 96 
      household contacts (HHCs), 18 tuberculosis (TB) patients, and 35 normal healthy 
      individuals. M. leprae DNA was detected in 95.92% (47/49) of MB, 70% (21/30) of PB, 
      and 6.25% (6/96) of HHC, but it was not detected in 18 TB or 35 normal controls. The 
      sensitivities of the anti-bovine serum albumin (ND-O-BSA) immunoglobulin M (IgM) and 
      antifusion protein of ML0405-ML2331 IgG for MB were 97.96% and 89.8%, and these 
      values for PB were 70% and 53.33%. However, the ND-O-BSA enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) had lower specificity, with relatively high false-positive results for 
      TB patients (16.67%) and normal healthy controls (10%). Based on these promising 
      findings, we propose the use of nested PCR of whole-blood samples along with ELISA 
      test for early detection of leprosy cases.

TI  - Polymerase chain reaction confirmed Mycoplasma pneumoniae arthritis: a case report.
PG  - 433-6
AB  - We report here a case of polyarthritis caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae in a 30 years 
      old male who initially triggered suspicion of tuberculosis. Synovial fluid subjected 
      to AFB smear, culture and PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis along with culture for 
      aerobic and anaerobic bacteria by standard methods were negative. Synovial fluid was 
      found to be positive by PCR for M. pneumoniae amplifying 543 bp fragment of P1 gene, 
      however it could not be grown in culture. Specific IgG immunoglobulins to M. 
      pneumoniae were also detected in synovial fluid as well as serum by ELISA which were 
      further confirmed by IgG immunoblotting showing response to M. pneumoniae proteins 
      specially immunodominant protein P1. The finding that both M. pneumoniae DNA and 
      specific antibodies to M. pneumoniae are present in synovial fluid of the patient 
      suggests that M. pneumoniae play an important role in arthritis. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first PCR confirmed M. pneumoniae infection in synovial fluid 
      from a case of polyarthritis.

      using a modified QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay.
PG  - 330-4
LID - 10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.03.020 [doi]
AB  - A modification of a highly practical human interferon-gamma release assay for the 
      diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), the QuantiFERON((R))-TB Gold (In-Tube Method) 
      (QFG-IT) assay, was evaluated for diagnosing natural mycobacterial infection in 
      rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). All animals in a captive colony were tested using 
      the QFG-IT and tuberculin skin test (TST). Animals testing positive to these tests 
      were euthanised and necropsied. Selected tissues were processed for histopathology 
      and mycobacterial culture, and positive cultures were speciated by Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis complex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 16S rRNA gene PCR 
      sequencing techniques. M. tuberculosis was cultured from a 
      TST-positive/QFG-IT-positive animal which showed gross pulmonary pathology typical 
      of TB. Additionally, Mycobacterium kansasii was cultured from a 
      TST-negative/QFG-IT-positive animal which had no pathological or histopathological 
      signs of mycobacterial infection. The detection of M. kansasii infection in a 
      QFG-IT-positive animal which showed no evidence of disease indicates that this test 
      might be a highly sensitive tool for the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection in 
      rhesus macaques. However, these findings highlight the limitations of the QFG-IT to 
      specifically detect infection by the pathogens M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium 
      bovis.

PG  - 61-68
LID - 10.1080/15284336.2018.1440991 [doi]
AB  - Background Viral load measurement is commonly applicable to monitor HIV infection in 
      patients to determine the number of HIV-RNA in serum samples of individuals. The aim 
      of the present study was to set up a highly specific, sensitive, and reproducible 
      home-brewed Real-time PCR assay based on TaqMan chemistry to quantify HIV-1 RNA 
      genome. Methods In this study, three sets of primer pairs and a TaqMan probe were 
      designed for HIV subtypes conserved sequences. An internal control was included in 
      this assay to evaluate the presence of inhibition. Standard curve and threshold 
      cycle values were determined using in vitro transcribed RNA from int region of 
      HIV-1. A serial dilution of RNA standards was generated by in vitro transcription, 
      from 10 to 10(9) copies/ml to find the sensitivity and the limit of detection (LOD) 
      of the assay and to evaluate its performance in a quantitative RT-PCR assay. Results 
      The assay has a low LOD equivalent to 33.13 copies/ml of HIV-1 RNA and a linear 
      range of detection from 10 to 10(9) copies/ml. The coefficient of variation (CV) for 
      Inter and Intra-assay precision of this in-house HIV Real-time RT-PCR ranged from 
      0.28 to 2.49% and 0.72 to 4.47%, respectively. The analytical and clinical 
      specificity was 100%. Conclusions The results indicate that the developed method has 
      a suitable specificity and sensitivity and is highly reproducible and cost-benefit. 
      Therefore, it will be useful to monitor HIV infection in plasma samples of 
      individuals.

TI  - Interactions between an M. tuberculosis strain overexpressing mtrA and mononuclear 
      phagocytes.
PG  - 172-83
LID - 10.2478/v10039-012-0058-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: It was previously shown that the bacterial two-component regulatory signal 
      transduction (2CR) system MtrAB may be associated with the ability of M. 
      tuberculosis (Mtb) to survive in macrophages. In the present work Mtb mutants: Rv-78 
      with overexpression of mtrA and Rv-129 with elevated level of 
      phosphorylation-defective MtrA were used for further investigation of the potential 
      influence of the MtrAB system on Mtb interaction with human monocytes. 
      MATERIAL/METHODS: Flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of MHC class 
      II molecules. The expression of genes for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 
      cathepsin G was quantified by RT-PCR. The association of Mtb strains with Rab5 and 
      Rab7 positive vacuoles was investigated applying confocal microscopy. IL-10 and 
      IL-12 secretion by monocytes as well as the Mtb susceptibility to cathepsin G were 
      investigated. RESULTS: Mutation-carried and wild type Mtb strains inhibited MHC 
      class II expression on monocytes to a similar extent. Monocyte stimulation with 
      mycobacteria led to the increased production of IL-10 but no detectable amounts of 
      IL-12 or NO were observed. Expression of the gene for iNOS was not detected while 
      that for cathepsin G was shown, however its intensity was not associated with MtrA 
      mutation. Mtb mutant strains were more effectively enclosed in phagosomes containing 
      the late endosome marker Rab7 as compared to the control. CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      may confirm the importance of the MtrAB system in mycobacterial capacity for 
      successful survival in phagocytes, especially in the context of high degree of 
      colocalization of Mtb Rv-78 to mature phagosomes.

AB  - Detection of antimicrobial resistance is important so that clinicians can make 
      rational decisions about optimal antimicrobial therapy for their patients. During 
      the past decade, new types of antimicrobial resistance have emerged, some of which 
      present new challenges for the clinical microbiology laboratory. In most cases, 
      conventional culture-based testing methods continue to be useful. In other 
      situations in which the organism responsible for infection grows slowly (for 
      example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), culture methods are technically difficult 
      (such as for human immunodeficiency virus), or genotypes are inconsistently 
      expressed (for instance, methicillin resistance in staphylococci), genetic 
      susceptibility testing methods may offer special advantages. Determining serum 
      concentrations of antimicrobial agents may be useful both to ensure adequacy of 
      treatment and to prevent toxicity. In this review, methods are described for 
      conventional and genetic tests used to guide antimicrobial therapy.

      in Pigs.
PG  - 2070

AB  - Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a subpopulation of evolutionarily 
      conserved innate-like T lymphocytes bearing invariant or semi-invariant TCRα chains 
      paired with a biased usage of TCRβ chains and restricted by highly conserved 
      monomorphic MHC class I-like molecule, MR1. Consistent with their phylogenetically 
      conserved characteristics, MAIT cells have been implicated in host immune responses 
      to microbial infections and non-infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, typhoid 
      fever, and multiple sclerosis. To date, MAIT cells have been identified in humans, 
      mice, cows, sheep, and several non-human primates, but not in pigs. Here, we cloned 
      porcine MAIT (pMAIT) TCRα sequences from PBMC cDNA, and then analyzed the TCRβ usage 
      of pMAIT cells expressing the TRAV1-TRAJ33 chain, finding that pMAIT cells use a 
      limited array of TCRβ chains (predominantly TRBV20S and TRBV29S). We estimated the 
      frequency of TRAV1-TRAJ33 transcripts in peripheral blood and tissues, demonstrating 
      that TRAV1-TRAJ33 transcripts are expressed in all tested tissues. Analysis of the 
      expression of TRAV1-TRAJ33 transcripts in three T-cell subpopulations from 
      peripheral blood and tissues showed that TRAV1-TRAJ33 transcripts can be expressed 
      by CD4(+)CD8(-), CD8(+)CD4(-), and CD4(-)CD8(-) T cells. Using a single-cell PCR 
      assay, we demonstrated that pMAIT cells with the TRAV1-TRAJ33 chain express cell 
      surface markers IL-18Rα, IL-7Rα, CCR9, CCR5, and/or CXCR6, and transcription factors 
      PLZF, and T-bet and/or RORγt. In conclusion, pMAIT cells expressing the TRAV1-TRAJ33 
      chain have characteristics similar to human and mouse MAIT cells, further supporting 
      the idea that the pig is an animal model for investigating MAIT cell functions in 
      human disease.

TI  - [Toxoplasma pericarditis without immunosuppressant disorder detected by polymerase 
      chain reaction of pericardial fluid: a case report].
PG  - 47-54
AB  - There have been several case reports, a total of 22 up to the present, of toxoplasma 
      pericarditis. Out of them, in only a few cases the diagnosis was properly made with 
      a proof of the microscopic presence of Toxoplasma gondii. This is the first report 
      of toxoplasma pericarditis in which the presence of Toxoplasma gondii was detected 
      by polymerase chain reaction of pericardial effusion. In addition, the previous 
      reports will be reviewed, and compared to this present case. A 29-year-old woman, 
      without immunosuppressant disorder, suffering from fever and orthopnea was admitted 
      to our hospital. Blood chemistry findings indicated mild liver dysfunction and 
      inflammation. Chest radiography showed cardiac enlargement. Electrocardiography 
      showed sinus tachycardia and ST elevation. Echocardiography revealed a massive 
      pericardial effusion. Pericardiocentesis demonstrated 638 ml of bloody fluid. 
      Cytologic study of the fluid was class II for malignancy, and polymerase chain 
      reaction to tuberculosis was negative. However, a high titer of the anti-toxoplasma 
      antibody of 1: 20,480 (passive hemagglutination) indicated pericarditis caused by 
      Toxoplasma gondii. Subsequently, Toxoplasma gondii was identified in the pericardial 
      effusion by polymerase chain reaction. Clinical symptoms improved after 
      pericardiocentesis, but 2 months later pericarditis recurred. Treatment was started 
      with 800 mg acetylspiramycin daily but failed to improve the symptoms. Because of 
      the development of pleuritis, treatment was changed to sulfadoxine 1,000 
      mg/pyrimethamine 50 mg. After the treatment with them, her symptoms improved. Only 
      22 cases of toxoplasma pericarditis have been reported worldwide and 15 of those 
      cases were without immunosuppressant disorder. The usual symptoms at the onset of 
      pericarditis without immunosuppressant disorder are fever, dyspnea and chest pain. 
      Seven patients developed cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis was performed in 8 
      cases and the pericardial fluid was hemorrhagic in 6. Pericardial thickening was 
      detected in 5 cases. The diagnosis of toxoplasma infection is very difficult, 
      because asymptomatic infection of Toxoplasma gondii is very common. Pericarditis is 
      a disease difficult to confirm the etiology. Detection of Toxoplasma gondii in 
      pericardial effusion by the polymerase chain reaction is very useful for its 
      diagnosis.

TI  - Molecular Analysis of Lipid-Reactive Vδ1 γδ T Cells Identified by CD1c Tetramers.
PG  - 1933-42
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1502202 [doi]
AB  - CD1c is abundantly expressed on human dendritic cells (DC) and B cells, where it 
      binds and displays lipid Ags to T cells. In this study, we report that CD1c 
      tetramers carrying Mycobacterium tuberculosis phosphomycoketide bind γδ TCRs. An 
      unbiased method of ligand-based TCR selection detects interactions only with Vδ1(+) 
      TCRs, and mutational analyses demonstrate a role of the Vδ1 domain during 
      recognition. These results strengthen evidence for a role of CD1c in the γδ T cell 
      response, providing biophysical evidence for CD1c-γδ TCR interactions and a named 
      foreign Ag. Surprisingly, TCRs also bind CD1c complexes formed with diverse lipids 
      such as lysophosphatidylcholine, sulfatide, or mannosyl-phosophomycoketide, but not 
      lipopeptide ligands. Dissection of TCR interactions with CD1c carrying foreign Ags, 
      permissive ligands, and nonpermissive lipid ligands clarifies the molecular basis of 
      the frequently observed but poorly understood phenomenon of mixed self- and foreign 
      Ag reactivity in the CD1 system.

TI  - Options to Expand HIV Viral Load Testing in South Africa: Evaluation of the 
      GeneXpert® HIV-1 Viral Load Assay.
PG  - e0168244
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0168244 [doi]
LID - e0168244
AB  - BACKGROUND: Expansion of HIV viral load (VL) testing services are required to meet 
      increased targets for monitoring patients on antiretroviral treatment. South Africa 
      currently tests >4million VLs per annum in 16 highly centralised, automated 
      high-throughput laboratories. The Xpert HIV-1 VL assay (Cepheid) was evaluated 
      against in-country predicates, the Roche Cobas Taqmanv2 and Abbott HIV-1RT, to 
      investigate options for expanding VL testing using GeneXpert's random access, 
      polyvalent capabilities and already established footprint in South Africa with the 
      Xpert MTB/RIF assay (207 sites). Additionally, the performance of Xpert HIV-1VL on 
      alternative, off-label specimen types, Dried Blood Spots (DBS) and whole blood, was 
      investigated. METHOD: Precision, accuracy (agreement) and clinical misclassification 
      (1000cp/ml) of Xpert HIV-1VL plasma was compared to Taqmanv2 (n = 155) and Abbott 
      HIV-1 RT (n = 145). Misclassification of Xpert HIV-1VL was further tested on DBS (n 
      = 145) and whole blood (n = 147). RESULTS: Xpert HIV-1VL demonstrated 100% 
      concordance with predicate platforms on a standardised frozen, plasma panel (n = 42) 
      and low overall percentage similarity CV of 1.5% and 0.9% compared to Taqmanv2 and 
      Abbott HIV-1 RT, respectively. On paired plasma clinical specimens, Xpert HIV-1VL 
      had low bias (SD 0.32-0.37logcp/ml) and 3% misclassification at the 1000cp/ml 
      threshold compared to Taqmanv2 (fresh) and Abbott HIV-1 RT (frozen), respectively. 
      Xpert HIV-1VL on whole blood and DBS increased misclassification (upward) by up to 
      14% with increased invalid rate. All specimen testing was easy to perform and 
      compatible with concurrent Xpert MTB/RIF Tuberculosis testing on the same 
      instrument. CONCLUSION: The Xpert HIV-1VL on plasma can be used interchangeably with 
      existing predicate platforms in South Africa. Whole blood and DBS testing requires 
      further investigation, but polyvalency of the GeneXpert offers a solution to 
      extending VL testing services.

TI  - A case of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia in an HIV-infected Korean

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is a type of 
      diffuse interstitial lung disease characterized by the pathology of fibroblastic 
      plugs in the lumens of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. The 
      occurrence of BOOP in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has 
      rarely been described, and there have been no clinical case reports in Korea. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old female who had been diagnosed with HIV ten years prior 
      was admitted due to a 1-year history of cough and sputum production and a 3-day 
      history of fever. She had poor adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) due to 
      gastrointestinal troubles. At the time of admission, her CD4 T-cell count was 5 
      cells/mm(3). A high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan showed tiny 
      centrilobular nodules with a tree-in-bud pattern in both lungs. Bacterial culture, 
      Pneumocystis jirovecii polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan 
      antigen (Ag) assay, and respiratory virus PCR were negative. Rapid chest x-ray 
      improvement was seen after a 7-day treatment with anti-tuberculosis medication, 
      ceftriaxone, and clarithromycin. Miliary tuberculosis seemed unlikely considering 
      the rapid radiologic improvement and negative tuberculosis PCR results. Due to the 
      unknown etiology, we performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to 
      determine the cause of the diffuse lung infiltration. Pathologic findings were 
      consistent with BOOP, while tissue acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain and tuberculosis 
      PCR results were negative. Tuberculosis medication and intravenous ceftriaxone were 
      discontinued, while treatment with clarithromycin monotherapy was sustained. Five 
      months after discharge, the patient was asymptomatic with a normal chest x-ray and 
      as her adherence to ART improved, her CD4 T-cell count rose to 181 cells/mm(3). 
      Clarithromycin was discontinued at that time and the patient is currently receiving 
      regular outpatient follow-up. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that macrolides are a 
      potential treatment option in HIV-infected patients with mild BOOP. In cases that 
      are otherwise unexplained or unresponsive to treatment, BOOP should be taken into 
      consideration and surgical biopsy performed to confirm a diagnosis of BOOP.

AB  - The BCG vaccine induces a Th1 phenotype, which is essential for protection against 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the effects of BCG vaccination over time on the 
      T helper subpopulation and the microRNAs involved in adulthood have not been 
      studied. In the present study, we explored the involvement of microRNAs, 
      transcription factors and multifunctional cytokines in BCG vaccination by examining 
      their levels both before and after vaccination of healthy adults. Peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells were obtained at 0, 2 and 6 months after vaccination. Cells were 
      cultured in the presence or absence of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 or M. tuberculosis 
      filtrate. The expression levels of miRNAs and transcription factors were evaluated 
      using qRT-PCR. Cytokine production in supernatants and serum samples was evaluated 
      using ELISA. Multifunctional CD4+ T cells were analyzed using multiparametric flow 
      cytometry. We observed a decrease in the expression levels of T-BET, GATA3 and FOXP3 
      at 2 months and miR-146a, miR-326 and miR-155 at 6 months after receiving the 
      vaccine. In the supernatant, the production of IL-17 was increased after 6 months, 
      with both stimuli. In contrast, IL-10, TNF-α and IFN-γ increased at 2 months. In the 
      serum, high levels of IL-10 were found after 2 months compared to time 0 and 6 
      months. The production of multifunctional cells that expressed the cytokine profiles 
      CD4+TNF-α+IFN-γ-IL-10-, CD4+TNF-α+IL-1IFN-γ-, CD4+IL-10+IFN-γ-TNF-α- and 
      CD4+IL-17+IFN-γ- predominantly increased after 2 months with and without the 
      stimulus. Correlation analysis revealed a negative association between FOXP3 and 
      miR-155 (r=-0.5120, p=0.0176) and between IL-17 and miR-326 (r=-0.5832, p=0.0364). 
      This study is the first to demonstrate roles for microRNAs, transcription factors 
      and cytokines in the T helper differentiation lineage and to describe the possible 
      mechanism by which their expression is modulated by the presence of the BCG vaccine 
      in adulthood. In conclusion, our results suggest that the BCG vaccine induces a 
      modulation in transcription factors and miRNAs with high production of 
      multifunctional cells CD4+TNF-α+IL-10+IFN-γ-.

TI  - An epitope-specific PCR test for diagnosis of Leishmania donovani infections.
PG  - 41-5
AB  - The carboxy-terminal region of recombinant heat shock protein 70 of Leishmania 
      donovani has been shown to have an immunodominant epitope. We designed a PCR assay 
      using a new set of primers encompassing the gene sequence from 457bp to 927bp, which 
      amplified a segment of the L. donovani genome in a species-specific manner. The 
      assay was sensitive enough to detect 0.5pg of parasite DNA, which increased 10-fold 
      (0.05pg) when an internal probe (583-609bp) was used in the Southern blot. The assay 
      was able to detect parasite DNA from the liver and spleen of L. donovani-infected 
      hamsters as well as lesion aspirates from parasitologically confirmed post-kala-azar 
      dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) and bone marrow aspirates from visceral leishmaniasis 
      (VL) patients. No amplification was seen with axenically cultured promastigotes of 
      L. infantum, L. tropica, L. major, L. mexicana, L. aethiopica or other intracellular 
      organisms such as Entamoeba histolytica, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium 
      vivax or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This PCR provides a specific tool 
      for the diagnosis of VL and PKDL with simultaneous species identification.

TI  - Diagnostic yield of a PCR assay in focal complications of brucellosis.
PG  - 3743-6
AB  - In order to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a PCR assay for patients with focal 
      complications of brucellosis, we studied by PCR and by conventional microbiological 
      techniques 34 nonblood samples from 32 patients with different focal forms of 
      brucellosis. The samples from patients with brucellosis were paired to an equal 
      number of control samples from the same locations of patients whose illnesses had 
      different etiologies. Thirty-three of the 34 nonblood samples (97%) from the 
      brucellosis patients were positive by PCR, whereas Brucella spp. were isolated from 
      only 29.4% of the conventional cultures. For 11.4% of the patients, the confirmatory 
      serological tests were either negative or showed titers below the diagnostic range. 
      Two patients (6.2%) from the control group, both with tuberculous vertebral 
      osteomyelitis, had a positive PCR result. The brucella PCR of blood from these two 
      patients was also positive, and the two strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      isolated were analyzed by the brucella PCR, with no evidence of amplification. These 
      results show that the PCR assay is far more sensitive than conventional cultures, 
      and this, coupled with its speed and reduction in risk to laboratory workers, makes 
      this technique a very useful tool for the diagnosis of focal complications of 
      brucellosis.

TI  - Tuberculous meningoencephalomyelitis and coinfection with HTLV-I + HTLV-II: case 
      report.
PG  - 125-7
AB  - HTLV-I and HTLV-II are endemic in some areas of Brazil, where an associated disease, 
      HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) have been 
      diagnosed in significant number of infected individuals. Tuberculosis has been 
      demonstrated among those individuals, with higher prevalence than in the general 
      population, suggesting that there is an increased risk for this comorbidity. We 
      report the case of an individual coinfected with HTLV-I and HTLV-II, suffering from 
      an insidious meningoencephalomyelitis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The 
      patient was a 44 years old man successfully treated with steroids and 
      antituberculous drugs, improving clinically and turning to a negative PCR and to a 
      normal blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.

AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the innate immune receptors, act as sentinels bridging 
      both innate and adaptive arms of immunity. In the present study, we estimated 
      TLR-induced secretion of IL-27, IL-12, IL-23, IL-8, IP-10, IL-17, IL-6 and TNF-α (by 
      ELISA) and expression of Human Leukocyte Antigen- (Human Leukocyte Antigen - antigen 
      D Related (HLA-DR), CD69, CD80 (also known asB7-1) (by flowcytometry) and Activating 
      Transcription Factor 3(ATF3) (by qRT-PCR) in whole blood cultures of control and 
      type-2 diabetic (both newly diagnosed/NDD and known/KDM) subjects. TLR-induced 
      secretion of IL-27 was significantly reduced in the NDD group compared to the 
      control (Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT)) and KDM groups. On the other hand, the 
      expression of CD80 was significantly upregulated in both the monocytes and B cells 
      in KDM group. This was associated with increased T cell activation 
      (CD3+CD69+HLA-DR+) with increased IL-17 and reduced TNF-α secretion in this group. 
      Impaired TLR-induced IL-27 secretion and augmented expression of antigen 
      presentation molecules result in chronic T cell activation which may fuel T 
      cell-mediated inflammation in type-2 diabetes.

TI  - Correlation between rpoB gene mutation in Mycobacterium avium subspecies 
      paratuberculosis and clinical rifabutin and rifampicin resistance for treatment of 
      Crohn's disease.
PG  - 2723-30
AB  - AIM: To investigate overlapping regions of the rpoB gene previously involved with 
      rifamycin resistance in M. tuberculosis and seek correlation between rpoB mutations 
      in clinical MAP strains with susceptibility to RIF and RFB. METHODS: We designed a 
      molecular-based PCR method for the evaluation of rifabutin (RFB) and rifampicin 
      (RIF) resistance based on probable determinant regions within the rpoB gene of MAP, 
      including the 81 bp variable site located between nucleotides 1363 and 1443. The 
      minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for RIF was also determined against 11 MAP 
      isolates in attempt to seek correlation with rpoB sequences. RESULTS: We determined 
      that MAP strain 18 had an MIC of > 30 mg/L and <or= 5 mg/L for RIF and RFB 
      respectively, and a significant and novel rpoB mutation C1367T, compared to an MIC 
      of <or= 1.0 mg/L for both drugs in the wild type MAP. The 30-fold increase in the 
      MIC was a direct result of the rpoB mutation C1367T, which caused an amino acid 
      change Thr456 to Ile456 in the drug's binding site; the beta subunit of RNA 
      polymerase. In addition, MAP strain 185 contained five silent rpoB mutations and 
      exhibited an MIC comparable to the wild-type. Moreover, our in vitro selected 
      mutation in MAP strain UCF5 resulted in the generation of a new resistant strain 
      (UCF5-RIF16r) that possessed T1442C rpoB mutation and an MIC > 30 mg/L and > 10 mg/L 
      for RIF and RFB respectively. Sequencing of the entire rpoB gene in MAP strains 
      UCF4, 18, and UCF5-RIF16r revealed an rpoB mutation A2284C further downstream of the 
      81 bp variable region in UCF4, accounting for observed slight increase in MIC. In 
      addition, no other significant mutations were found in strains 18 and UCF-RIF16r. 
      CONCLUSION: The data clearly illustrates that clinical and in vitro-selected MAP 
      mutants with rpoB mutations result in resistance to RIF and RFB, and that a single 
      amino acid change in the beta subunit may have a significant impact on RIF 
      resistance. Unconventional drug susceptibility testing such as our molecular 
      approach will be beneficial for evaluation of antibiotic effectiveness. This 
      molecular approach may also serve as a model for other drugs used for treatment of 
      MAP infections.

TI  - Fine needle aspiration cytology of granulomatous mastitis.
PG  - 519-21
AB  - AIMS: Granulomatous mastitis (GM) is an uncommon breast lesion that mimics 
      carcinoma. The fine needle aspiration cytological (FNAC) features of GM have rarely 
      been discussed in the literature. These features are reported in eight 
      histologically confirmed cases of GM. METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken 
      in which a diagnosis of GM had been made on histopathology, and the FNAC slides were 
      reviewed and assessed for the presence of granulomas, necrosis, multinucleated giant 
      cells, and inflammatory background cells. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis was performed on the histological material to exclude 
      tuberculosis. RESULTS: All cases were confirmed histologically and PCR for 
      mycobacterial DNA was negative. In the FNACs, varying numbers of granulomas composed 
      of epithelioid histiocytes were present in four cases. The same four cases showed 
      giant cells of either foreign body or Langhan's type. No necrosis was noted. Six 
      cases showed many histiocytes, some plump and others epithelioid, in the background. 
      The number of epithelioid histiocytes corresponded to the presence of granulomas. 
      Neutrophils were the predominant background inflammatory cells in most cases (six). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The cytological diagnosis of GM is difficult because the features 
      overlap with other aetiologies, including tuberculosis. Specific features are 
      absent. The absence of necrosis and a predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate in the 
      background favour a diagnosis of GM. This diagnosis should also be considered when 
      abundant epithelioid histiocytes are seen in smears, even in the absence of 
      granulomas. However, the definitive diagnosis of GM depends on histology from fine 
      needle biopsies and negative microbiological investigations.

TI  - Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum in nasal mucus from cattle in a herd infected with 
      bovine tuberculosis.
PG  - 281-5
AB  - Skin test negative cattle from a herd containing an unusually high proportion 
      (194/382) of tuberculin skin test positive cattle were investigated for remaining 
      Mycobacterium bovis infected animals. Blood samples from the skin test negative 
      cattle, analysed by an antibody ELISA and an interferon-gamma assay, were mostly 
      test negative for M. bovis. Radiometric culture of nasal mucus samples from 48 of 
      the cattle yielded 22 culture positives with acid-fast bacilli and cording in 6 of 
      these. Subculture on solid media was successful for 7, including 2 with cording of 
      the 22 radiometric culture positives. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA probe 
      testing using the Accuprobe (Gen-Probe, Inc.) and M. tuberculosis complex-specific 
      PCR amplification, performed on the solid media subcultures, were negative. 16S rRNA 
      PCR and sequence analysis were successful for 6 of the 7 solid media subcultures 
      obtained and revealed the presence of Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum in all 6 
      subcultures. This is the first report of M. nonchromogenicum in nasal mucus of 
      cattle. The observation highlights the importance of integrating definitive tests 
      such as the PCR for diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis and indicates a possible 
      zoonotic risk.

      quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay.
PG  - 925-33

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenesis and transmission of elephant 
      endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV1) by analyzing various elephant fluid samples 
      with a novel EEHV1-specific real-time PCR assay. ANIMALS: 5 apparently healthy 
      captive Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) from the same herd. PROCEDURES: A 
      real-time PCR assay was developed that specifically detects EEHV1. The assay was 
      used to evaluate paired whole blood and trunk-wash samples obtained from the 5 
      elephants during a 15-week period. Deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing and viral gene 
      subtyping analysis were performed on trunk-wash DNA preparations that had positive 
      results for EEHV1. Viral gene subtypes were compared with those associated with past 
      fatal cases of herpesvirus-associated disease within the herd. RESULTS: The PCR 
      assay detected viral DNA to a level of 1,200 copies/mL of whole blood. It was used 
      to detect EEHV1 in trunk secretions of 3 of the 5 elephants surveyed during the 
      15-week period. Viral gene subtyping analysis identified 2 distinct elephant 
      herpesviruses, 1 of which was identical to the virus associated with a previous 
      fatal case of herpesvirus-associated disease within the herd. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: EEHV1 was shed in the trunk secretions of healthy Asian 
      elephants. Trunk secretions may provide a mode of transmission for this virus. 
      Results of this study may be useful for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of 
      EEHV1-associated disease and the overall management of captive elephant populations.

AB  - Melioidosis abdominal aortic aneurysm and splenic abscesses lead to poor prognosis 
      and high mortality rate as high as 50% due to delayed/missed diagnosis. We describe 
      an attempt to identify Burkholderia pseudomallei immediately, which was confirmed by 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene sequence analysis of 23S rRNA gene. PCR is 
      not only an unambiguous identification of B. pseudomallei but also a rapid detection 
      because B. pseudomallei may not be readily isolated. For patients of melioidosis 
      abdominal aortic aneurysm with spleen abscess, prolonged antibiotic therapy, 
      splenectomy and artificial vessel replacement provided an excellent result in our 
      study. The progression, roentgenographic findings and histopathology character of 
      melioidosis are similar to those of tuberculosis disease. PCR is useful to 
      differentiate B. pseudomallei from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

TI  - Molecular and immunological analyses of the Mycobacterium avium homolog of the 
      immunodominant Mycobacterium leprae 35-kilodalton protein.
PG  - 2684-90
AB  - The analysis of host immunity to mycobacteria and the development of discriminatory 
      diagnostic reagents relies on the characterization of conserved and species-specific 
      mycobacterial antigens. In this report, we have characterized the Mycobacterium 
      avium homolog of the highly immunogenic M. leprae 35-kDa protein. The genes encoding 
      these two proteins were well conserved, having 82% DNA identity and 90% identity at 
      the amino acid level. Moreover both proteins, purified from the fast-growing host M. 
      smegmatis, formed multimeric complexes of around 1000 kDa in size and were 
      antigenically related as assessed through their recognition by antibodies and T 
      cells from M. leprae-infected individuals. The 35-kDa protein exhibited significant 
      sequence identity with proteins from Streptomyces griseus and the cyanobacterium 
      Synechoccocus sp. strain PCC 7942 that are up-regulated under conditions of nutrient 
      deprivation. The 67% amino acid identity between the M. avium 35-kDa protein and 
      SrpI of Synechoccocus was spread across the sequences of both proteins, while the 
      homologous regions of the 35-kDa protein and the P3 sporulation protein of S. 
      griseus were interrupted in the P3 protein by a divergent central region. Assessment 
      by PCR demonstrated that the gene encoding the M. avium 35-kDa protein was present 
      in all 30 M. avium clinical isolates tested but absent from M. intracellulare, M. 
      tuberculosis, or M. bovis BCG. Mice infected with M. avium, but not M. bovis BCG, 
      developed specific immunoglobulin G antibodies to the 35-kDa protein, consistent 
      with the observation that tuberculosis patients do not recognize the antigen. Strong 
      delayed-type hypersensitivity was elicited by the protein in guinea pigs sensitized 
      with M. avium.

      signals of gold nanorods.
PG  - 8424-30
LID - 10.1021/ac801005d [doi]
AB  - A one-step label-free optical genosensing method has been developed in this 
      contribution by taking short DNA target with its sequence related to the human 
      immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) as an example. By employing anisotropic 
      nonspherical and positively charged gold nanorods (Au-NRs) as the recognition 
      platform, which show high stability against aggregation under high ionic strength 
      conditions without any additional stable reagent, we found that the addition of 
      target DNA to the mixture of nonmodified Au-NRs suspension and label-free probe DNA 
      in high ionic strength buffer leads to a color change from red to light purple in 
      less than 5 min, displaying strong plasmon resonance light scattering (PRLS) 
      signals. Mechanism investigations showed that the strong PRLS signals should be 
      ascribed to the aggregation of Au-NRs induced by the formed double-stranded 
      oligonucleotides (dsDNA) from the hybridization of target DNA with probe DNA. With 
      the PRLS signals, we monitored the hybridization process of a 21-mer single-stranded 
      oligonucleotide (ssDNA) from the HIV-1 U5 long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence with 
      its complementary oligonucleotide and detected the effect of single-base-pair 
      mismatches. Two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon artificial samples derived 
      from Mycobacterium tuberculosis glmS and genes encoding for Bacillus glucanase and 
      an HIV-1 LTR sample isolated from HIV-1-positive blood were detected with 
      satisfactory results, showing that the present method has simplicity, sensitivity, 
      specificity, and reliability for sequence-specific DNA detection related to the HIV 
      gene.

TI  - Differential expression of Th2 chemokine receptors on T cells from atopic and 
      nonatopic asthmatics in response to Der p 1-pulsed dendritic cells.
PG  - S62-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: In vitro polarized human Th2 cells preferentially express the chemokine 
      receptors CCR3 and CCR4 and migrate to their ligands: eotaxin, monocyte-derived 
      chemokine (MDC) or CCL22, thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) or 
      CCL17. However little is known about the regulation of these chemokine receptor axes 
      by Der p 1-pulsed dendritic cells in house dust mite (HDM)-sensitive and non-atopic 
      asthmatics. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the modulatory effects of Der p 
      1-pulsed DCs on the expression of CCR3 and CCR4 on CD4+ T cells of HDM-sensitive and 
      non-atopic asthmatics. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Using real-time RT-PCR and flow 
      cytometry analysis, the expression of CCR3 and CCR4 were assessed in autologous CD4+ 
      T cells after co-incubation with Der p 1-pulsed DCs from these two asthmatic groups. 
      We also determined the mRNA expression of CCR4 ligands TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22 in 
      monocyte-derived DCs after Der p 1 pulsation. RESULTS: We performed flow cytometry 
      analysis of CD4+ T cells from HDM-sensitive and non-atopic asthmatics, taken 24 and 
      48 h after co-incubation with Der p 1-pulsed DCs. We demonstrated that after 
      co-incubation, there was a significant increase in CCR3+ and CCR4+ CD4+ T cells from 
      HDM-sensitive asthmatics, which began to occur at 24 h and 48 h respectively, and 
      corresponded to their expression at mRNA levels. In contrast, only CCR4 mRNA but not 
      protein expression was increased in non-atopic CD4+ T cells. After Der p 1 
      pulsation, mRNA expression of CCR4-specific ligands (CCL17 and CCL22) was also 
      markedly upregulated in HDM-sensitive DCs whereas only CCL17 gene expression was 
      increased in non-atopic DCs. CONCLUSION: These data support the role of DCs in 
      differential regulation of CCR3 and CCR4 on CD4+ T cells from HDM-sensitive and 
      non-atopic asthmatics after Der p 1 exposure.

TI  - Bartonella quintana-induced vulval bacillary angiomatosis.
PG  - 390-4
LID - 10.1097/PGP.0b013e31823f8463 [doi]
AB  - Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is an increasingly reported infection, mainly in 
      patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Different epidemiological risk 
      factors are associated with the transmission of the causative agents, Bartonella 
      henselae and B. quintana. Vulval BA is described rarely. Two patients presented with 
      a vulval mass (Patient 1) and a verrucous vulval growth (Patient 2), which were 
      diagnosed clinically as tuberculosis and carcinoma, respectively. Patient 1 also had 
      pulmonary tuberculosis and Kaposi sarcoma. Biopsy of the vulval lesions confirmed 
      BA, characterized by a multilobular proliferation of blood vessels that were lined 
      by epithelioid endothelial cells. There were prominent intervascular neutrophils, 
      karyorrhectic debris, and clumps of paravascular argyrophilic organisms. The biopsy 
      from Patient 1 was deep dermal/subcutaneous in location and displayed foci of 
      confluent suppuration. There was florid pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia in the 
      biopsy from Patient 2. Molecular investigations confirmed intralesional B. quintana, 
      hitherto unreported in vulval BA, as the causative agent in both biopsies. On 
      follow-up, Patient 2 had developed additional lesions in the vulva and thigh, but 
      all her lesions and the vulval mass (Patient 1) responded to erythromycin treatment. 
      Patient 1 succumbed to tuberculosis. Heightened recognition of BA underpins rapid 
      and optimal clinicopathological diagnosis, even in uncommon locations. 
      Identification of the causative Bartonella species is important for appropriate, 
      interventive social management.

TI  - [Diagnostic criteria for HIV/AIDS in Japan].
PG  - 688-93
AB  - In Japan, criteria for the diagnosis of HIV infection and AIDS have been revised in 
      1999. For the diagnosis of HIV infection, HIV-positivity has to be confirmed by 
      western blot test or nucleic acid tests such as PCR for HIV when the results of 
      screening tests for anti-HIV antibodies (ELISA) are positive. Diagnosis of AIDS can 
      be made when HIV-infected persons show any one of 23 indicator diseases. Criteria 
      for the diagnosis of these 23 diseases are described. The indicator disease most 
      frequently seen in Japan is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia followed by candidiasis, 
      cytomegalovirus infection, tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteriosis in this 
      order. The number of new cases of AIDS is still increasing every year.

TI  - Generation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific recombinant antigens and 
      evaluation of the clinical value of antibody detection for serological diagnosis of 
      pulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - 751-7
LID - 10.3892/ijmm.2013.1254 [doi]
AB  - Rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) infection is critical in clinical 
      practice. To establish an effective serological diagnostic technique, we generated 
      the several Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific immunogenic antigens and 
      evaluated the clinical benefits of detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM 
      antibodies raised against these target antigens for the diagnosis of patients with 
      active TB. The genes encoding the MTB-specific antigens 6-kDa early secretory 
      antigenic target of MTB (ESAT-6), 10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP-10), ESX-1 
      substrate protein C (ESPC), 14KD/38KD and ESAT-6/14KD/38KD, were amplified from the 
      MTB genome by PCR. Prokaryotic vectors were constructed for the expression of the 
      individual MTB antigens. The target recombinant protein was expressed in 
      Escherichia coli (BL21/DE3) and purified using immobilized metal affinity 
      chromatography (IMAC). An ELISA based immunoassay was set up using these target 
      antigens for the diagnosis of active TB. The detection samples included 98 patients 
      with active TB and 102 healthy control volunteers. The cutoff OD value for IgG and 
      IgM antibodies was selected according to a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      analysis. The sensitivity, specificity and positive likelihood ratio were also 
      determined. We successfully cloned, expressed and purified the ESAT-6, CFP-10, ESPC, 
      14KD/38KD and ESAT‑6/14KD/38KD recombinant antigens of MTB. The mean levels of IgG 
      antibodies were significantly higher in patients with pulmonary TB compared with 
      control groups. The target MTB-specific antigens can distinguish a TB infection from 
      a non-TB infection, showing significant difference in statistics (P<0.001). The 
      sensitivity of the IgG test ranged from 69.4% (ESAT-6) to 77.6% (ESAT-6/14KD/38KD) 
      in the active TB patients; the specificity of assays varied from 78.4% (CFP-10) to 
      90.2% (14KD+38KD) in the healthy control groups. The IgM antibody test can not 
      distinguish a TB infection from a non-TB healthy control. In conclusion, clinical 
      use of the ESAT-6, CFP-10, ESPC, 14KD/38KD and ESAT-6/14KD/38KD antigens based on 
      serodiagnostic IgG assay is of significant value for the rapid diagnosis of TB and 
      for the discrimination between active TB patients and healthy controls.

TI  - Clinical course of sarcoidosis in dependence on HLA-DRB1 allele frequencies, 
      inflammatory markers, and the presence of M. tuberculosis DNA fragments.
PG  - 66-74
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: For sarcoidosis it is generally hypothesized that inherited 
      factors and environmental antigens may contribute to pathogenesis. Since M. 
      tuberculosis DNA was found in a significant percentage of sarcoidosis patients, we 
      analyzed the relationship between HLA-DRB1 alleles, inflammatory markers and the 
      presence of M. tuberculosis DNA in sarcoidosis and its influence on clinical course. 
      METHODS: From 144 patients with sarcoidosis lung tissue, BAL and/or blood were 
      investigated by means of PCR assays to detect an 123 bp multicopy element of M. 
      tuberculosis DNA and HLA-DRB1 alleles, respectively. ACE was measured 
      spectrophotometrically, sIL-2R by ELISA. Clinical data describing the disease course 
      were available from 63 patients. RESULTS: The percentage of M. tuberculosis positive 
      sarcoidosis patients was significantly increased in the chronic patients group 
      compared to acute disease. The percentage of HLA-DRB 1*03 positive patients was 
      significantly higher in acute sarcoidosis, whereas in chronic disease the 
      HLA-DRB1*11 positive patients were clearly over-represented. In addition, we found a 
      highly significant correlation of HLA-DRB1*11 or -DRB1*15 alleles and/or the 
      presence of M. tuberculosis DNA to a chronic disease course, whereas HLA-DRB1*03 or 
      -DRB1*04 alleles combined with the absence of M. tuberculosis DNA were associated 
      with an acute sarcoidosis (p = 0.009). ACE and sIL2-R serum levels were 
      significantly higher in M. tuberculosis positive sarcoidosis independent of the 
      HLA-DRB1 specificity, but did not differ between acute and chronic disease course 
      alone. CONCLUSIONS: The association between certain HLA-DR antigens, the presence of 
      M. tuberculosis DNA and disease course indicates that specific antigens of M. 
      tuberculosis may play a pathogenetic role in chronic sarcoidosis.

LID - e88822
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The morbidity of ulcerative colitis (UC) is increasing in China 
      every year. In addition, there is a lack of accurate diagnostic indices with which 
      to evaluate the activity of the disease. The aim of this study was to identify 
      UC-associated proteins as biomarkers for the diagnosis, and objective assessment of 
      disease activity. METHODS: Differential expression of serum proteins from UC 
      patients compared to normal controls was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis 
      (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass 
      spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The expression of heat shock factor 2(HSF2)in colonic 
      mucosa in Crohn's disease, Behcet's disease, ulcerative colitis, intestinal 
      tuberculosis, infective enteritis, intestinal lymphoma, and normal controls was 
      investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of the HSF2 in colonic 
      mucosa of UC subjects with varying severity of disease was measured by real time-PCR 
      and Western Blots. The expression of HSF2 was inhibited by HSF2 small interfering 
      RNA (siRNA) transfection in Caco-2 cells. The concentrations of HSF2, IL-1β, and 
      TNF-α in serum and IL-1β, and TNF-α in the supernatants of transfected Caco-2 cells 
      were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: HSF2 was differentially expressed in UC patients 
      compared to normal controls. HSF2 expression was significantly higher in the 
      intestinal mucosa of UC patients compared to other six groups. The results of 
      immunohistochemistry, real time-PCR, Western Blots, and ELISA showed that the 
      expression of HSF2 increased in parallel with the severity of UC. The serum 
      concentration of HSF2 also positively correlated with levels of IL-1β and TNF-α. 
      After down-regulation expression of HSF2 in Caco-2 cells by RNA interference, the 
      productions of IL-1β and TNF-α stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased 
      dramatically. CONCLUSIONS: HSF2 appears to be a potential novel molecular marker for 
      UC activity, and may provide a basis for studies on the pathogenesis and novel 
      therapeutic targets for UC.

      associated with a strong T cell response. The reactions of the cytotoxic and helper 
      T lymphocyte subsets after BCG vaccination were analyzed by cytofluorometry and in 
      functional tests. The relative number of CD8(+) T cells in the spleen increased 
      substantially after injection of BCG. In vitro restimulation after immunization 
      induced a strong proliferative response but no cytotoxic reactions of CD8(+) T cells 
      against BCG-infected macrophages. A specific induction of IFN-gamma and RANTES mRNA 
      was observed after vaccination particularly in CD8(+) but not in CD4(+) T cells of 
      the lymph nodes.

AB  - Little is known about the type 1/type 2 T cell dichotomy in old age. Peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and T cell lines from old and young healthy 
      individuals were therefore analyzed for their production of interferon gamma 
      (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 4 (IL-4). Tetanus toxoid (TT), purified protein 
      derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, inactivated influenza virus and OKT-3 were 
      used as stimuli. RT-PCR and ELISA determinations were performed. When stimulated 
      with TT, PBMC from young and old individuals expressed IL-4, but produced little 
      IFN-gamma. All other stimuli induced a pronounced IFN-gamma production, while little 
      or no IL-4 was expressed. T cell lines, regardless of their specificity or the donor 
      age, produced IFN-gamma and IL-4. The quantities of cytokines produced did not 
      significantly differ between the age groups. The capacity of the immune system to 
      trigger type 1 and type 2 T cell responses is thus well preserved in old age.

AB  - AIMS: To observe the relationship among genes, obesity and the changes in serum 
      glucose and lipid profile to assess whether obesity-related disease results from 
      genes and/or obesity. METHODS: Correlations among serum glucose, lipids, waist 
      circumference (WC), and Taq1B, I405V, and D442G polymorphisms of the cholesteryl 
      ester transfer protein (CETP) gene were assessed. Logistic regression analysis was 
      used to screen independent variables among obesity-related anthropometric indexes 
      and serum biochemical indicators for genes. RESULTS: The waist circumference density 
      index (WCDI) may be attributed to changes in serum biochemical indicators and among 
      WCDI, BMI and serum biochemical indicators, however, only WCDI was an independent 
      variable for the G allele. Differences were observed in anthropometric indexes and 
      serum biochemical indicators between subjects with the G allele and those without 
      (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Abdominal obesity and changes in serum glucose and lipid 
      profile are affected by a group of genes, including CETP. Correlation of the CETP 
      gene with waist circumference may be independent compared with serum glucose and 
      lipid profile.

PG  - 399-406
AB  - Tuberculosis infections caused by Mycobacterium (M.) pinnipedii in a South American 
      sea lion, Bactrian camel, and Malayan tapirs kept in two zoological gardens spanning 
      a time period of 5 years are reported. The zoos were linked by the transfer of one 
      tapir. Conventional bacteriological and molecular methods were applied to detect the 
      pathogen. Spoligotyping and MIRU/VNTR-typing performed to assess the genetic 
      similarity revealed identical molecular characteristics of the isolates from all 
      animals involved. Anti-tuberculosis antibodies were detected using ELISA and a 
      recently developed serological rapid test. The study shows that: (i) using molecular 
      methods, the assessment of the genetic relationship of infectious agents helps to 
      confirm the routes of infection, and that (ii) immunological tests may help to 
      detect tuberculosis infections ante mortem more reliably and early. This would 
      prevent the transfer of tuberculosis by asymptomatic animals.

PG  - 759-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcomes of Prevention of Parent to Child Transmission 
      (PPTCT) of HIV program in an urban Southern Indian setting. DESIGN: Observational 
      study. SETTING: Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) Centers/ Integrated Counseling and 
      Testing Centers (ICTC) at four government Obstetrics Institutes in an urban area. 
      PARTICIPANTS: 100 HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants delivered in the 
      study centers. METHODS: Triple drug ART to HIV-positive pregnant women was started 
      for maternal indications only. Rest of the pregnant women were given single dose 
      Nevirapine (200 mg) at the onset of labor. All infants were given single dose 
      Nevirapine (2 mg/kg) prophylaxis, according to National AIDS Control Organization 
      guidelines. Mothers were counseled regarding breastfeeding and artificial feeding, 
      and the choice was left to them. Whole blood HIV 1 DNA PCR was done for all infants 
      at 6 weeks of life. A second PCR was done at 6 months or 6 weeks after stopping 
      breastfeeds. PCR-positive infants were started on ART, and were followed-up till18 
      months of life. RESULTS: Four infants were PCR-positive for HIV. All of them were 
      breastfed. They were born to mothers of HIV stage 1 or 2 who were not on ART as CD4 
      counts were >350 cells/mm3. Among the mothers in Stage 3 or 4 or CD4 count <200 
      cells/mm3 and on ART, none of the infants was HIV-positive. The cumulative HIV-free 
      survival at 18 months was 94%. CONCLUSIONS: Parent-to-child transmission rate in HIV 
      was low with the currently used strategies. Triple drug ART to mother reduces 
      mother-to-child transmission despite advanced maternal stage or low CD4 counts.

TI  - A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB) assay for detection 
      of bacterial respiratory pathogens in children with pneumonia.
PG  - 150-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a novel method for simultaneous identification 
      of 12 potential bacterial pathogens in children with community-acquired pneumonia. 
      METHODS: A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assay was developed, to 
      identify 12 respiratory bacterial pathogens, namely Staphylococcus aureus, 
      Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus 
      influenzae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Bordetella pertussis, Klebsiella 
      pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia 
      pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and single (uniplex) PCRs were used for S. 
      pneumoniae and H. influenzae only. In a preliminary evaluation, we compared the 
      results of mPCR/RLB with those of single (uniplex) PCRs and culture of 
      nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 100 children under 5 years, admitted to Beijing 
      Children's Hospital between October 2004 and May 2005, with pneumonia. RESULTS: 
      Reference strains and clinical isolates of all 12 target species were correctly 
      identified by mPCR/RLB. Potential pathogens were isolated from one blood culture and 
      26% of respiratory cultures. One or more pathogens were identified in 70% of 
      respiratory specimens--by mPCR/RLB in 63%, uPCR only in another 3%, culture only in 
      2%, and culture plus uPCR in 2%. The species most commonly identified were S. 
      pneumoniae (54%) and H. influenzae (38%, including type b, 4%). Cultures were not 
      performed for B. pertussis, M. tuberculosis, C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae but each 
      was identified by mPCR/RLB in between one and four specimens. Two or more potential 
      pathogens were identified in 35% of specimens. Ten of 14 S. pneumoniae isolates 
      belonged to serotypes represented in the 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The mPCR/RLB assay is a sensitive tool for identification of 
      respiratory pathogens, including mixed infections and bacteria requiring special 
      culture methods.

      of infection. However, after 48 h of infection, bfl-1/A1 expression was evident only 
      in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv but not in M. tuberculosis H37Ra infected cells. 
      When parallel experiments were performed with Human monocyte-derived macrophages 
      (MDMs), differential expression of bfl-1/A1 mRNA was observed in case of M. 
      tuberculosis H37Rv and M. tuberculosis H37Ra infection. siRNA mediated inhibition of 
      bfl-1/A1 induced apoptosis in M. tuberculosis H37Rv infected THP-1 and MDMs. 
      Reduction in intracellular mycobacterial growth was observed in bfl-1/A1 siRNA 
      transfected, M. tuberculosis H37Rv infected THP-1 cells. Enhancement of 
      phagosome-lysosome fusion was observed in bfl-1/A1 siRNA treated and M. tuberculosis 
      H37Rv infected THP-1 cells. These results clearly indicated that differential 
      expression of bfl-1/A1 in M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. tuberculosis H37Ra infected 
      THP-1 cells probably account for the difference in infection outcome.

TI  - Inducible nitric oxide synthase in pulmonary alveolar macrophages from patients with 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 2293-302
AB  - The high-output pathway of nitric oxide production helps protect mice from infection 
      by several pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, based on 
      studies of cells cultured from blood, it is controversial whether human mononuclear 
      phagocytes can express the corresponding inducible nitric oxide synthase 
      (iNOS;NOS2). The present study examined alveolar macrophages fixed directly after 
      bronchopulmonary lavage. An average of 65% of the macrophages from 11 of 11 patients 
      with untreated, culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis reacted with an antibody 
      documented herein to be monospecific for human NOS2. In contrast, a mean of 10% of 
      bronchoalveolar lavage cells were positive from each of five clinically normal 
      subjects. Tuberculosis patients' macrophages displayed diaphorase activity in the 
      same proportion that they stained for NOS2, under assay conditions wherein the 
      diaphorase reaction was strictly dependent on NOS2 expression. Bronchoalveolar 
      lavage specimens also contained NOS2 mRNA. Thus, macrophages in the lungs of people 
      with clinically active Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection often express 
      catalytically competent NOS2.

TI  - Genus level identification of mycobacteria from clinical specimens by using an 
      easy-to-handle Mycobacterium-specific PCR assay.
PG  - 614-7
AB  - An easy-to-handle Mycobacterium-specific PCR assay for detection of the presence of 
      a wide range of mycobacterial species in clinical samples was evaluated. The 
      performance of the genus probe was compared with the performance of probes specific 
      for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium and with that of standard 
      culture. In addition, the utility of an internal control in monitoring amplification 
      inhibitors was studied. Of 545 respiratory and 325 nonrespiratory specimens (a total 
      of 870 specimens), 58 (6.7%) showed the presence of amplification inhibitors, as 
      determined by a negative result for the internal control. Of these 58 specimens, 31 
      (53%) were stool specimens; other material, even citrate blood after lysis of 
      erythrocytes, did not pose a problem with regard to inhibition of PCR amplification. 
      Eighty-one of the remaining 812 specimens had a positive Mycobacterium culture 
      result. Of these culture-positive specimens, 58 (71.6%) showed a positive result 
      with the Mycobacterium genus-specific probe. Seventy-two samples had a positive 
      result with the Mycobacterium-specific probe but a negative culture result. Of these 
      72 samples, 26 samples were regarded as true positive, either because the M. 
      tuberculosis- or M. avium-specific probe was also positive at the same time or 
      because other specimens from the same patient taken at the same time were culture 
      positive. The sensitivity of the Mycobacterium-specific probe was 78.5% and the 
      specificity was 93.5%. This study showed that pretesting of clinical specimens for 
      mycobacteria to the genus level with a Mycobacterium-specific probe offers the 
      routine clinical laboratory the possibility of detecting tuberculous and 
      nontuberculous mycobacteria with one test. Furthermore, specimens testing positive 
      with the genus-specific probe can be immediately identified with species-specific 
      probes.

TI  - Coinfections and differential diagnosis in immunocompetent patients with uveitis of 
      infectious origin.
PG  - 91
LID - 10.1186/s12879-018-3613-8 [doi]
LID - 91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Making a definite diagnosis of infectious uveitis is a challenging task 
      because many other infectious, and non-infectious uveitis, may have similar 
      non-specific symptoms and overlapping clinical appearances. Co-infections in 
      immunocompetent patients are not frequently proved with traditional 
      serologic-diagnostic tools. METHODS: Descriptive transversal study, in a Uveitis 
      Service of an Ophthalmology Reference Center, in Bogotá, Colombia, from July 2014 to 
      February 2016. Aqueous humor (AH) and/or vitreous fluid, blood and serum samples 
      were collected from consecutive patients suspected of having infectious uveitis. The 
      diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) was confirmed by the Goldmann-Witmer 
      coefficient (GWC) and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Differential diagnosis by 
      PCR in AH was done for viral origin such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex 
      virus type 1 (HSV1), Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), Varicella zoster virus 
      (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. RESULTS: In 66 
      Colombian patients with uveitis of presumed infectious origin: 22 (33.3%) were 
      confirmed as OT, 16 (24.2%) as undetermined OT, five (7.5%) as co-infections and 23 
      (34.8%) as other uveitis. Toxoplasma coinfection with M. tuberculosis was identified 
      in one case by PCR and in four cases with HSV by GWC. The initial clinical diagnosis 
      changed, after laboratory examination, in 21 cases (31.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical 
      diagnosis can be changed by laboratory examination in a significant proportion of 
      cases of uveitis. Diagnosis of OT should combine the use of PCR and GWC to reach the 
      maximum of confirmation of cases. The use of multiple laboratory methods is 
      necessary to identify co-infections and viral infections that can mimic OT in 
      immunocompetent patients.

TI  - The impact of new technology on the laboratory's contribution to the diagnosis and 
      management of mycobacterial disease.
PG  - 113-29
AB  - From the time of the discovery of the tubercle bacillus in the late nineteenth 
      century until the introduction of chemotherapy in the mid-twentieth, the role of the 
      laboratory in the management of tuberculosis was limited because the treatment of 
      the disease was nonspecific. The advent of specific chemotherapy and the recognition 
      of human diseases caused by a number of mycobacterial species other than M. 
      tuberculosis increased the scope and importance of the clinical laboratory in 
      guiding the diagnosis and management of mycobacterial disease. This included the 
      isolation of mycobacteria, the identification of the isolates, the determination of 
      their susceptibilities to chemotherapeutic agents and their subtyping for 
      epidemiologic purposes. In spite of the enhanced role it has played in the past 
      forty years, the laboratory's contribution has been impeded by the slow growth of 
      mycobacteria, which causes delays of weeks or months between submission of a 
      specimen and the availability of a definitive report. In the meantime both the 
      urgency and the complexity of diagnosis and management of mycobacterial disease have 
      increased with the emergence of epidemics of these diseases associated with the 
      acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This development has also increased the 
      need for recognition of tubercle bacilli in such specimens as blood and stools, 
      which were only infrequently studied in past years. Recent developments in 
      microchemical and immunologic technology, and especially molecular biology, are 
      greatly reducing the time needed to get information that contributes to diagnosis 
      and management of mycobacterial disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of 
      tuberculosis, and gene polymorphisms in the promoter regions of cytokine genes were 
      shown to substantially influence the secretory capacity of immune cells. In the 
      present study, we analyzed the association between polymorphisms of the IL12B, IL18, 
      and IL27 genes and the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12р70, IL-18, 
      and IL-27 by myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) 
      patients. The study enrolled 334 patients with newly diagnosed infiltrative and 
      disseminated PTB. Cultivation of mDCs was performed from non-proliferating 
      progenitors of CD14(+) blood monocytes. Cytokine secretion was evaluated by 
      measuring cytokine concentration in the mDC culture supernatants using enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent essay (ELISA). To study cytokine gene polymorphisms, a polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) 
      were performed. Reduced secretion of IL-18 and IL-27 by mDCs in PTB patients was 
      associated with 105A/C polymorphisms of the IL18 gene, and 2905T/G, 4730T/С, and 
      -964A/G of the IL27 gene, respectively. Polymorphism IL12B/insertion had a 
      bidirectional influence on the secretion of IL-12p70, being associated with 
      decreased levels of the cytokine in infiltrative PTB and increased levels in 
      disseminated PTB patients.

TI  - Reliability of induced sputum test is greater than that of throat swab test for 
      detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patients with COVID-19: A multi-center cross-sectional 
      study.
PG  - 1394-1401
LID - 10.1080/21505594.2020.1831342 [doi]
AB  - We previously reported that sputum induction was more sensitive than throat swabs 
      for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 
      two convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients; however, the value 
      and safety of induced sputum testing require further study. We conducted a 
      prospective multi-center cross-sectional study to compare induced sputum to throat 
      swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Confirmed COVID-19 patients from six hospitals in 
      six cities across China who received one or more negative RT-PCR result for 
      SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled, and paired specimens (induced sputum and throat swabs; 56 
      cases) were assayed. In three paired samples, both the induced sputum and throat 
      swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positive rate for induced sputum was 
      significantly higher than for throat swabs both overall (28.6% vs 5.4%, 
      respectively; p < 0.01). Patients were divided according to time span from onset of 
      illness to sample collection into the more-than-30-day (n = 26) and less-than-30-day 
      (n = 30) groups. The positive rate for induced sputum was also significantly higher 
      than for throat swabs in the less-than-30-day group (53.3% vs 10.0%, respectively; p 
      < 0.001). For the more-than-30-day group, all paired samples were negative for 
      SARS-CoV-2. Blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and heart rate remained 
      stable during sputum induction and no staff were infected. Because induced sputum is 
      more reliable and has a lower false-negative rate than throat swabs, we believe 
      induced sputum is more useful for the confirmation of COVID-19 and is safer as a 
      criterion for release from quarantine.

AB  - The purpose of our research was to evaluate diagnostic performance of serum 
      microRNA-135a (miR-135a) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Quantitative real 
      time-polymerase chain reaction was employed to detect the expression serum of 
      miR-135a in NSCLC patients and controls. The influence of serum miR-135a level on 
      clinical characteristics of NSCLC patients was explored through the Chi-square test. 
      Serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was estimated via enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to 
      elucidate diagnostic roles of serum miR-135a and CEA in NSCLC.The expression level 
      of serum miR-135a was significantly lower in NSCLC patients than in healthy controls 
      (0.40 ± 0.29 vs 1.00 ± 0.40, P < .001). Moreover, miR-135a expression was related to 
      lymph node metastasis (P = .021), tumor differentiation (P = .020), and tumor node 
      metastasis stage (P = .031). ROC curve showed serum miR-135a level could 
      discriminate NSCLC patients from healthy controls (P < .0001) with a corresponding 
      cutoff value of 0.665, and a sensitivity and specificity of 81.3% and 83.1%, 
      respectively. The area under the curve was 0.888. In diagnosis analysis on the 
      combination of miR-135a and CEA, when its specificity was maintained at 90%, 
      diagnosis cut-off point reached 0.678.Serum miR-135a level is significantly 
      downregulated in NSCLC and serves as a potential diagnostic biomarker for the 
      disease.

TI  - Development of a species-specific PCR assay for detection of Leishmania donovani in 
      clinical samples from patients with kala-azar and post-kala-azar dermal 
      leishmaniasis.
PG  - 849-54
AB  - We have developed a PCR assay that is capable of amplifying kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) 
      of Leishmania donovani in a species-specific manner among Old World leishmanias. 
      With Indian strains and isolates of L. donovani the assay was sensitive enough to 
      detect kDNA in an amount equivalent to a single parasite or less. The extreme 
      sensitivity of the assay was reflected in its ability to detect parasite DNA from 
      small volumes of peripheral blood of patients with kala-azar (KA) and from skin 
      lesions from patients with post-KA dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). A total of 107 
      clinical leishmaniasis samples were analyzed. Of these 102 (95.3%) were positive by 
      PCR. The test provided a diagnosis of KA with 96% sensitivity using patient 
      whole-blood samples instead of bone marrow or spleen aspirates that are obtained by 
      invasive procedures. The assay was also successful in the diagnosis of 45 of 48 PKDL 
      cases (93.8%). Cross-reactions with pathogens prevalent in the area of endemicity, 
      viz., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and Plasmodium spp., could 
      be ruled out. Eighty-one control samples, including dermal scrapings from healthy 
      portions of skin from patients with PKDL were all negative. Two of twenty controls 
      from the area of endemicity were found positive by PCR assay; however, there was a 
      good possibility that these two were asymptomatic carriers since they were 
      serologically positive for KA. Thus, this PCR assay represents a tool for the 
      diagnosis of KA and PKDL in Indian patients in a noninvasive manner, with 
      simultaneous species identification of parasites in clinical samples.

AB  - Tuberculids are chronic nodular skin eruptions believed to be a systemic reaction to 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We report on a 6-year-old boy with tender subcutaneous 
      lesions on his legs. A tuberculin skin test resulted in 2.5 cm of induration and an 
      interferon-gamma releasing assay was also markedly positive. A diagnosis of erythema 
      induratum of Bazin was confirmed on skin biopsy. The patient was successfully 
      treated with multi-drug antituberculosis therapy.

TI  - Detection and identification of mycobacteria by amplification of RNA and DNA in 
      pretreated blood and bone marrow aspirates by a simple lysis method.
PG  - 2124-8
AB  - A sodium dodecyl (lauryl) sulfate method was evaluated for the preparation of blood 
      specimens and bone marrow aspirates for use in two amplification procedures 
      (Gen-Probe Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test [AMTDT] and Roche 
      Amplicor M. avium/M. intracellulare [MAI] Test) for the detection and identification 
      of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. avium and M. intracellulare, respectively. The 
      AMTDT is based on amplification of rRNA, whereas the Amplicor MAI Test amplifies a 
      specific DNA region of the 16S rRNA gene. The results of amplification techniques 
      were compared with those of standard culture and culture in BACTEC 13A and BACTEC 
      12B liquid media. A total of 121 blood specimens and 15 bone marrow aspirates were 
      collected from 136 AIDS patients. Mycobacterial growth was recovered for 103 
      specimens; 35 yielded M. tuberculosis, 62 yielded M. avium, 5 yielded M. genavense, 
      and 1 yielded M. kansasii. The values of sensitivity and specificity in pretreated 
      specimens for detection of M. tuberculosis by the AMTDT were 94.3 and 100%, 
      respectively, and those for detection of M. avium by the Amplicor MAI Test were 91.9 
      and 100%, respectively. The simple lysis method described in the present work allows 
      the recovery of mycobacteria from blood specimens and bone marrow aspirates and may 
      be used in combination with the AMTDT and the Amplicor MAI Test to detect and 
      identify different members of the genus Mycobacterium. This method might also be 
      applicable for the identification of mycobacteria from blood culture fluids with 
      acridinium-ester-labeled DNA probes.

TI  - Evaluation of diagnostic tests for Johne's disease in young cattle.
PG  - 113-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the development of immune responses in calves 
      experimentally and naturally infected with Mycobacterium paratuberculosis and to 
      evaluate the potential for diagnostic tests to detect infected calves. DESIGN: 
      Sequential testing of four treatment groups of calves over a 2 year period. 
      PROCEDURE: Twenty-nine calves were allocated to four groups. Group D calves were 
      orally dosed with M paratuberculosis, group N calves naturally exposed to M 
      paratuberculosis, group V calves vaccinated for M paratuberculosis, and group C were 
      control calves (not infected or vaccinated). Blood and faecal specimens were 
      collected from each calf at monthly intervals to 18 months of age and then every 2 
      months until they were slaughtered between the ages of 21 and 29 months. Specimens 
      were tested using absorbed EIA, IFN-gamma EIA and faecal culture. The infection 
      status of the calves was confirmed by extensive histopathological examination and 
      tissue culture. RESULTS: M paratuberculosis infection was confirmed in 10 calves, 
      comprising six of eight orally dosed calves, three of five naturally exposed calves 
      and one of nine vaccinated calves. The six artificially infected calves and one 
      naturally infected calf were detected shedding M paratuberculosis in their faeces. 
      Results with positive absorbed EIA were obtained from one artificially infected 
      calf, one naturally infected calf and three vaccinated calves. All calves including 
      controls had positive results on at least one occasion using the IFN-gamma EIA. In 
      addition, seven calves had positive bovine tuberculosis results using the IFN-gamma 
      EIA, even though bovine tuberculosis has been eradicated from Australia. CONCLUSION: 
      Detection of M paratuberculosis infection in young cattle continues to be difficult 
      using current tests.

AB  - Cytokine Th1/Th2 balance is known to play a key role in controlling Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis infection. Based upon the functional role of the TNF-α [-308 
      G(low) → A(high) (rs1800629)] and IL-10 [-1082 A(low) → G(high) (rs1800870), -819 
      T(low) → C(high) (rs1800871) and -592 A(low) → C(high) (rs1800872)] single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on production levels, we genotyped 76 patients with 
      pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) (pTB), 55 patients with extrapulmonary TB (epTB) and 95 
      healthy blood donors by polymerase chain reaction fragment length polymorphism 
      (PCR-RFLP). We observed that -308 A allele was associated with increased risk 
      susceptibility to epTB (OR = 1.96; 95% CI, 1.04-3.71; P = 0.024). The -1082 AG 
      genotype was significantly associated with increased risk development of epTB (odds 
      ratio [OR] = 3.69; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.73-7.92; P corrected for the 
      number of genotypes [Pc] = 0.0003). By contrast, -1082 AA genotype appeared to be 
      associated with resistance to pTB (OR = 0.38; 95% CI, 0.19-0.74; Pc = 0.006) and 
      epTB (OR = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.1-0.48; Pc = 0.00006). High-producer IL-10 GCC haplotype 
      seemed to be associated with 2.11-fold (95% CI, 1.28-3.46; Pc = 0.003) and 2.57-fold 
      (95% CI, 1.5-4.4; Pc = 0.0006) increased susceptibility to pTB and epTB, 
      respectively. Combination of TNF-α/IL-10 high producer genotypes was associated with 
      increased 3.13-fold (95% CI, 1.23-8.05; Pc = 0.028) susceptibility to epTB. However, 
      combined TNF-α/IL-10 low producer genotypes appeared to have protect effect to pTB 
      (OR = 0.44, 95% CI, 0.21-0.89; Pc = 0.04) and epTB (OR = 0.26, 95% CI, 0.1-0.62; 
      Pc = 0.0028). Collectively, our results showed that analysed SNPs in the TNF-α and 
      IL-10 gene polymorphisms play key role in susceptibility to or protection against TB 
      development in Tunisian populations.

TI  - Identification of sero-reactive antigens for the early diagnosis of Johne's disease

LID - e0184373
AB  - Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative agent of Johne's 
      disease (JD), a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease of cattle and other 
      ruminants. JD has a high herd prevalence and causes serious animal health problems 
      and significant economic loss in domesticated ruminants throughout the world. Since 
      serological detection of MAP infected animals during the early stages of infection 
      remains challenging due to the low sensitivity of extant assays, we screened 180 
      well-characterized serum samples using a whole proteome microarray from 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), a close relative of MAP. Based on extensive 
      testing of serum and milk samples, fecal culture and qPCR for direct detection of 
      MAP, the samples were previously assigned to one of 4 groups: negative low exposure 
      (n = 30, NL); negative high exposure (n = 30, NH); fecal positive, ELISA negative (n 
      = 60, F+E-); and fecal positive, ELISA positive (n = 60, F+E+). Of the 740 reactive 
      proteins, several antigens were serologically recognized early but not late in 
      infection, suggesting a complex and dynamic evolution of the MAP humoral immune 
      response during disease progression. Ordinal logistic regression models identified a 
      subset of 47 candidate proteins with significantly different normalized intensity 
      values (p<0.05), including 12 in the NH and 23 in F+E- groups, suggesting potential 
      utility for the early detection of MAP infected animals. Next, the diagnostic 
      utility of four MAP orthologs (MAP1569, MAP2942c, MAP2609, and MAP1272c) was 
      assessed and reveal moderate to high diagnostic sensitivities (range 48.3% to 76.7%) 
      and specificity (range 96.7% to 100%), with a combined 88.3% sensitivity and 96.7% 
      specificity. Taken together, the results of our analyses have identified several 
      candidate MAP proteins of potential utility for the early detection of MAP 
      infection, as well individual MAP proteins that may serve as the foundation for the 
      next generation of well-defined serological diagnosis of JD in cattle.

AB  - Background: The diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis (TB) can be difficult in 
      severely malnourished children. This is mainly due to the fact of our perceived 
      notion that clinical signs of TB are often subtle in severely malnourished children 
      and we may rely on laboratory investigation for the diagnosis. However, comparative 
      data on the performance of clinical and laboratory diagnostics of TB in such 
      population are also very limited. Objectives: To compare the performance of 
      composite clinical criteria and a technique that measures antibodies in lymphocyte 
      supernatant (ALS) for the diagnosis of TB in severely malnourished children with 
      pneumonia. Methods: Severely malnourished children under five with radiological 
      pneumonia admitted to the Dhaka Hospital of International Centre for Diarrhoeal 
      Disease Research, Bangladesh were enrolled consecutively following informed consent. 
      We collected venous blood for ALS, gastric lavage fluid and induced sputum for 
      microscopy, mycobacterial culture, and real-time PCR by Xpert MTB/RIF. We compared 
      the sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values, and accuracy 
      of modified Kenneth Jones criteria (MKJC) score, World Health Organization (WHO) 
      criteria, and ALS in diagnosing TB in severely malnourished children with pneumonia 
      for "Confirmed TB" and "All TB" ("Confirmed TB" plus "Probable TB") vs. "Not TB." 
      Results: Compared to culture confirmed TB, the sensitivity, and specificity (95% CI) 
      for MKJC were 60 (27-86) and 84 (79-87)% and for WHO criteria were 40 (14-73) and 84 
      (80-87)%, respectively. Compared to culture and/or Xpert MTB/RIF positive TB, the 
      sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) for the criteria were 37 (20-58) and 84 
      (79-87)%; and 22 (9-43) and 83 (79-87)%, respectively. For both these comparisons, 
      the sensitivity and specificity of ALS were 50 (14-86) and 60 (53-67)%, 
      respectively. Conclusion: Our data suggest that WHO criteria and MKJC scoring mainly 
      based on clinical criteria are more useful than ALS in diagnosing TB in young 
      severely malnourished children with pneumonia. The results underscore the importance 
      of using clinical criteria for the diagnosis of TB in severely malnourished children 
      that may help to minimize the chance of over treatment with anti-TB in such 
      population, especially in resource limited TB endemic settings.

TI  - Immune responses to 18.6 and 30-kDa mycobacterial antigens in rheumatoid patients, 
      and V beta usage by specific synovial T-cell lines and fresh T cells.
PG  - 803-12
AB  - We have investigated both the humoral and the cellular immune responses of patients 
      with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to 
      mycobacterial antigens. The JRA group was not Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) 
      vaccinated whilst the majority of the RA group was. As determined by immunoblotting, 
      79% of sera from patients with JRA reacted mainly with a 18.6-kDa protein (P18.6), 
      whilst 70% of sera from patients with RA reacted mainly with a 30-kDa protein (P30) 
      of BCG, M. tuberculosis and M. kansasii. In contrast, only a moderate proportion of 
      the control sera (25% of adult and 20% of children) showed reactivity to P30, and 
      none of the samples had significant reactivity with the P18.6 antigen. Furthermore, 
      T-cell proliferation to the P18.6 and P30 antigens was detected in the majority of 
      JRA and RA patients, and was nearly always higher in synovial fluid (SF) than in the 
      peripheral blood (PB). We also investigated the usage of V beta family genes in 
      P18.6 and P30 antigen-specific T-cell lines established from the SF of one patient 
      with active RA. We showed that V beta 2, -4, -5, -6, -7, -14, -17, -18 and V beta 19 
      were over-represented compared with other known V beta families. We also noted that 
      the proportion of V beta 14 was higher in freshly isolated SF mononuclear cells 
      compared with the blood in this patient and in 2 out of 4 other RA patients 
      examined. Other V beta families such as V beta 6, V beta 8, V beta 16, V beta 18 and 
      V beta 19 were also over-represented in the SF compared with the blood in some 
      patients. Taken together our results provide more information concerning the role of 
      mycobacterial antigens in RA and suggest that there may be an in vivo clonal 
      expansion of T lymphocytes in the synovium.

TI  - LAG-3 potentiates the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in host phagocytes by 
      modulating mitochondrial signaling in an in-vitro granuloma model.

AB  - CD4+ T-cell mediated Th1 immune responses are critical for immunity to TB. The 
      immunomodulatory protein, lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) decreases Th1-type 
      immune responses in T-cells. LAG-3 expression is significantly induced in the lungs 
      of macaques with active TB and correlates with increased bacterial burden. 
      Overproduction of LAG-3 can greatly diminish responses and could lead to 
      uncontrolled Mtb replication. To assess the effect of LAG-3 on the progression of 
      Mtb infection, we developed a co-culture system wherein blood-derived macrophages 
      are infected with Mtb and supplemented with macaque blood or lung derived CD4+ 
      T-cells. Silencing LAG-3 signaling in macaque lung CD4+ T-cells enhanced killing of 
      Mtb in co-cultures, accompanied by reduced mitochondrial electron transport and 
      increased IFN-γ expression. Thus, LAG-3 may modulate adaptive immunity to Mtb 
      infection by interfering with the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Better 
      understanding this pathway could allow us to circumvent immune features that promote 
      disease.

AB  - Helminths are known to elicit a wide range of immunomodulation characterized by 
      dominant Th2-type immune responses. Our group previously showed that a DNA vaccine 
      encoding the mycobacterial 65-kDa heat shock protein (DNA-hsp65) showed 
      immunomodulatory properties. We also showed, using a helminth-tuberculosis (TB) 
      co-infection model, that the DNA-hsp65 vaccine protected mice against TB. We next 
      investigated the mechanistic role of the vaccine during helminth-TB co-infection. 
      Clinically, helminth infection causes type 2 granulomas in the lung. Mice were 
      immunized with DNA-hsp65 while they were submitted to the type 2 granuloma induction 
      protocol by Schistosoma mansoni eggs infusion. In this work we investigated the 
      effects of DNA-hsp65 on the pathology and immune response during the development of 
      type 2 granuloma induced by S. mansoni eggs. Histologic analyses of lung parenchyma 
      showed that the DNA-hsp65 vaccine protected mice against exacerbated fibrosis 
      induced by Schistosoma eggs, and decreased the size of the granulomas. These changes 
      were correlated with a reduction in the number of T cells specific for the egg 
      antigens in the lung and also with modulation of Th2 cytokine expression. Taken 
      together, our results showed that the adjuvant properties of the DNA-hsp65 vaccine 
      regulated the immune response in this Th2 model, and resulted in a preserved lung 
      parenchyma.

TI  - Correlation between clinical diagnosis and PCR analysis of serum, aqueous, and 
      vitreous samples in patients with inflammatory eye disease.
PG  - 109-14
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the applicability (sensitivity, specificity) of polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) tests in the detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes virus (HSV) 
      and varicella zoster (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Mycobacterium sp and 
      Toxoplasma gondii in the diagnosis of patients with or without AIDS, with presumably 
      infectious uveitis, using serum, aqueous humor and vitreous humor samples. METHODS: 
      Twenty individuals with uveitis of presumed infectious origin were evaluated. 
      Sixteen of them had AIDS, four were immunocompetent individuals. We also evaluated 4 
      normal controls who underwent vitrectomy surgery. Clinical evaluation of the 
      patients was performed together by three clinicians. PCR evaluations of the serum, 
      aqueous, and vitreous humor were performed in a masked fashion by the laboratory 
      staff. RESULTS: Twelve patients had a clinical diagnosis of CMV retinitis. Of these 
      6 (50%) had a positive PCR for CMV in the vitreous, three (25%) had a positive PCR 
      for CMV in the serum, and none were positive in the aqueous. Five patients had a 
      clinical diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN). Three (60%) of these had 
      positive PCR for HSV/VZV in the vitreous. One of these patients had a positive PCR 
      reaction for both EBV and HSV/VZV in the vitreous samples. One patient with 
      cutaneous herpes zoster had a positive PCR reaction for HSV/VZV in the serum. Four 
      patients had a presumed diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis, one patient (25%) had a 
      positive PCR for Toxoplasma gondii in the serum, 3 (75%) had positive results in the 
      aqueous, and 2 (50%) had positive results in the vitreous. One patient with presumed 
      ocular tuberculosis had a positive PCR reaction both in the serum and in the 
      vitreous samples. Finally, none of the four control individuals revealed any 
      positive PCR reaction. CONCLUSION: PCR is an auxiliary diagnostic procedure that 
      should be evaluated together with ophthalmological aspects of the patient.

TI  - Neutrocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts the presence of a replicative hepatitis C 
      virus strand after therapy with direct-acting antivirals.
PG  - 401-406
LID - 10.1007/s10238-019-00561-y [doi]
AB  - Residual HCV-RNA can persist in liver tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMCs) long after antiviral therapy of chronic hepatitis C in patients repeatedly 
      negative for viral RNA in serum. This occult infection associates with impaired 
      immune response and the risk of lymphoproliferative disorders or progressive liver 
      disease. There are currently no monitoring strategies for patients after treatment. 
      We investigated if serum inflammation markers and interferon lambda (IFNL) genotype 
      can be predictors of the presence of HCV-RNA and the replicative HCV-RNA (-) strand 
      in patients who reached sustained virological response after interferon-free 
      therapy. Forty-two consecutive patients who remained HCV-RNA negative in serum 
      24 weeks after the end of treatment (EOT) and during the follow-up were enrolled. 
      Total HCV-RNA and HCV-RNA (-) strand were detected using ultrasensitive RT-PCR in 
      PBMCs collected 12-15 months after EOT. Polymorphisms within IFNL3-IFNL4 region 
      (rs12979860 and ss469415590) were genotyped with allele-specific PCR. Viral RNA was 
      found in PBMCs from 31 (74%) patients, and of those 29 (69%) were also positive for 
      HCV-RNA (-). Neither normalization of alanine aminotransferase nor IFNL genotype 
      predicted the presence of residual HCV-RNA. A significantly higher 
      neutrocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) 24 weeks after the start of treatment predicted 
      elimination of replicative HCV-RNA strand (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.10-0.86; P = 0.019). 
      Patients with no HCV-RNA (-) in PBMCs showed a greater increase in neutrocyte count 
      between EOT and baseline (P = 0.028). Lack of significant elevation of NLR after 
      therapy with direct-acting antivirals could predict the presence of residual 
      replicative HCV-RNA strand in PBMCs.

TI  - A common human TLR1 polymorphism regulates the innate immune response to 
      lipopeptides.
PG  - 2280-9
AB  - Toll-like receptors (TLR) are critical mediators of the immune response to pathogens 
      and human polymorphisms in this gene family regulate inflammatory pathways and are 
      associated with susceptibility to infection. Lipopeptides are present in a wide 
      variety of microbes and stimulate immune responses through TLR1/2 or TLR2/6 
      heterodimers. It is not currently known whether polymorphisms in TLR1 regulate the 
      innate immune response. We stimulated human whole blood with triacylated 
      lipopeptide, a ligand for TLR1/2 heterodimers, and found substantial 
      inter-individual variation in the immune response. We sequenced the coding region of 
      TLR1 and found a non-synonymous polymorphism, I602S (base pair T1805G), that 
      regulated signalling. In comparison to TLR1_602S, the 602I variant mediated 
      substantially greater basal and lipopeptide-induced NF-kappaB signalling in 
      transfected HEK293 cells. These signalling differences among TLR1 variants were also 
      found with stimulation by extracts of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Furthermore, 
      individuals with the 602II genotype produced substantially more IL-6 than those with 
      the 602SS variant in a lipopeptide-stimulated whole-blood cytokine assay. Together, 
      these observations demonstrate that variation in the inflammatory response to 
      bacterial lipopeptides is regulated by a common TLR1 transmembrane domain 
      polymorphism that could potentially impact the innate immune response and clinical 
      susceptibility to a wide spectrum of pathogens.

TI  - Malaria on isolated Melanesian islands prior to the initiation of malaria 
      elimination activities.
PG  - 218
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-9-218 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Australian Government's Pacific Malaria Initiative (PacMI) is 
      supporting the National Malaria Program in both Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, 
      complementing assistance from the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria 
      (GFATM). Two remote island groups - Tafea Province, Vanuatu and Temotu Province, 
      Solomon Islands have been selected by the governments of both countries as possible 
      malaria elimination areas. To provide information on the prevalence and distribution 
      of the disease within these island groups, malariometric surveys were conducted 
      during the wet seasons of 2008. METHODS: In Tafea Province, a school-based survey 
      was conducted which included the 2-12 y age group, while in Temotu a village based 
      all-ages survey was conducted. An effort was made to sample villages or schools from 
      a wide an area as possible on all islands. Diagnosis was initially based on Giemsa 
      stained blood slides followed by molecular analysis using polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR). RESULTS: In Tafea Province, 73% (5238/7150) of children (2-12 y) were 
      surveyed and in Temotu Province, in the all-ages survey, 50.2% (8742/17410) of the 
      provincial population participated in the survey. In both Vanuatu and Solomon 
      Islands malariometric surveys of their southern-most islands in 2008 showed 
      relatively low over-all malaria parasite prevalence (2 to 3%). Other features of 
      malaria in these island groups were low parasitaemia, low gametocyte carriage rates, 
      low spleen rates, low malaria associated morbidity, a high incidence of asymptomatic 
      infections, and a predominance of Plasmodium vivax over Plasmodium falciparum. 
      CONCLUSION: For various reasons malaria rates are declining in these provinces 
      providing a favourable situation for local malaria elimination. This will be 
      advanced using mass distribution of bed nets and selective indoor residual spraying, 
      the introduction of rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin combination therapy, and 
      intensive case detection and surveillance. It is as yet uncertain whether malaria 
      parasites can themselves be sustainably eliminated from entire Melanesian islands, 
      where they have previously been endemic. Key issues on the road to malaria 
      elimination will be continued community involvement, improved field diagnostic 
      methods and elimination of residual P. vivax parasites from the liver of 
      asymptomatic persons.

TI  - Monocytes and the 38kDa-antigen of mycobacterium tuberculosis modulate natural 
      killer cell activity and their cytolysis directed against ovarian cancer cell lines.
PG  - 451
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-12-451 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite strong efforts to improve clinical outcome of ovarian cancer 
      patients by conventional and targeted immuno-based therapies, the prognosis of 
      advanced ovarian cancer is still poor. Natural killer (NK) cells mediate 
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), release immunostimulatory cytokines 
      and thus function as potent anti-tumour effector cells. However, tumour cells 
      developed mechanisms to escape from an effective immune response. So highly 
      immunogenic substances, like the 38 kDa-preparation of M. tuberculosis, PstS-1, are 
      explored for their potential to enhance cancer-targeted immune responses. In this 
      study we examined the modulation of different NK cell functions by accessory 
      monocytes and PstS-1. We focussed on NK cell activation as well as natural and 
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity directed against 
      epidermal-growth-factor-receptor (EGFR)-positive ovarian cancer cell lines. METHODS: 
      Activation, cytokine release and cytotoxicity of NK cells stimulated by monocytes 
      and PstS-1 were determined by FACS-analysis, ELISA, Bioplex assay and quantitative 
      polymerase-chain reaction (qPCR). Transwell assays were used to discriminate 
      cell-cell contact-dependent from contact-independent mechanisms. Five ovarian cancer 
      cell lines (A2780, IGROV-1, OVCAR-3, OVCAR-4 and SKOV-3) with different 
      EGFR-expression were used as target cells for natural and antibody-dependent 
      cellular cytotoxicity assays. Cetuximab (anti-EGFR-antibody) was used for ADCC 
      studies. RESULTS: Our data show that monocytes effectively enhance activation as 
      well natural and antibody-dependent cytolytic activity of NK cells. PstS-1 directly 
      stimulated monocytes and further activated monocyte-NK-co-cultures. However, PstS-1 
      did not directly influence purified NK cells and did also not affect natural and 
      antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity directed against EGFR-positive ovarian 
      cancer cells, even in presence of monocytes. Direct cell-cell contact between NK 
      cells and monocytes was required for NK activation, while released cytokines seemed 
      to play a minor role. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that monocytes enhance natural 
      and antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity of NK cells in a cell-cell contact 
      dependent manner. The TLR-agonist PstS-1 provides additional monocyte activation and 
      induces NK activation markers, while NK cytotoxicity remains unaffected. We conclude 
      that monocytes provide accessory function for ADCC exerted by NK during 
      antibody-based cancer immunotherapy directed against EGFR-positive ovarian cancer 
      cells.

AB  - The development of simple, accurate, rapid and cost-effective technologies for 
      mutation detection is crucial to the early diagnosis and prevention of numerous 
      genetic diseases, pharmacogenetics, and drug resistance. Proofreading PCR (PR-PCR) 
      was developed for mutation detection in 1998 but is rarely applied due to its low 
      efficiency in allele discrimination. Here we developed a modified PR-PCR method 
      using a ddNTP-blocked primer and a mixture of DNA polymerases with and without the 
      3'-5' proofreading function. The ddNTP-blocked primer exhibited the best blocking 
      efficiency to avoid nonspecific primer extension while the mixture of a tiny amount 
      of high-fidelity DNA polymerase with a routine amount of Taq DNA polymerase provided 
      the best discrimination and amplification effects. The modified PR-PCR method is 
      quite capable of detecting various mutation types, including point mutations and 
      insertions/deletions (indels), and allows discrimination amplification when the 
      mismatch is located within the last eight nucleotides from the 3'-end of the 
      ddNTP-blocked primer. The modified PR-PCR has a sensitivity of 1-5 × 102 copies and 
      a selectivity of 5 × 10-5 mutant among 107 copies of wild-type DNA. It showed a 100% 
      accuracy rate in the detection of P72R germ-line mutation in the TP53 gene among 60 
      clinical blood samples, and a high potential to detect rifampin-resistant mutations 
      at low frequency in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using an adaptor and a fusion-blocked 
      primer. These results suggest that the modified PR-PCR technique is effective in 
      detection of various mutations or polymorphisms as a simple, sensitive and promising 
      approach.

TI  - An unusual course of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in a patient with 
      idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia.
PG  - 788-91
AB  - A case is reported of idiopathic CD4+T lymphocytopenia with progressive multifocal 
      leukoencephalopathy and cervical lymph node tuberculosis. A 57 year old Japanese man 
      presented with cervical lymphadenopathy and progressive neurological deficits, and 
      six months later he developed akinetic mutism. He had a persistent severely 
      depressed number of circulating CD4+T lymphocytes in the absence of human 
      immunodeficiency virus infection. T1 weighted MRI showed a diffuse decreased signal 
      intensity limited to the white matter without mass effect. A brain biopsy specimen 
      had a morphology similar to that of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 
      Polyomavirus antigen was detected in the brain lesion, and viral DNA was identified 
      in nucleated blood cells and urine. Unusually this serious medical condition has 
      lasted for more than three years without remission. To our knowledge this is the 
      first patient with CD4+T lymphocytopenia with progressive multifocal 
      leukoencephalopathy, suggesting that similar opportunistic infections should be 
      considered even in previously normal people.

TI  - Common NOD2 mutations are absent in patients with Crohn's disease in India.
PG  - 201-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is being increasingly diagnosed in the Indian 
      subcontinent. Three apparently common mutations in the NOD2 gene are found in up to 
      30% of sporadic patients with Crohn's disease in western countries. We examined 
      whether such mutations are also found in Indian patients with Crohn's disease. 
      METHODS: Venous blood was collected from 82 patients (age range: 7-65 years, 53 men) 
      with Crohn's disease and 149 control subjects; DNA was extracted and subjected to 
      polymerase chain reaction using specific primers. The amplified fragments of size 
      185, 163 and 151 bp for R702W, G908R and 1007fs, respectively, were digested with 
      MspI, HhaI and ApaI, and the restriction pattern noted after electrophoresis. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients had ileocolonic disease, 26 ileal disease, 20 colonic 
      disease and 8 had disease limited to proximal small bowel or stomach. None of the 82 
      patients showed any of the three NOD2 mutations. The control subjects (93 men) had a 
      variety of chronic gastrointestinal disorders (ulcerative colitis 52, irritable 
      bowel syndrome 30, intestinal tuberculosis 20, colon cancer 7, miscellaneous 37). 
      None of the control subjects showed a mutation in any of the three NOD2 mutation 
      analyses. CONCLUSION: The three NOD2 gene mutations described above are uncommon in 
      Indian patients with Crohn's disease. This study complements information provided by 
      recent studies on NOD2 mutations in Indians.

TI  - Pulmonary delivery of chitosan-DNA nanoparticles enhances the immunogenicity of a 
      DNA vaccine encoding HLA-A*0201-restricted T-cell epitopes of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 1609-15
AB  - In this study, we used an HLA-A2 transgenic mouse model to investigate the effects 
      of pulmonary delivery of a new DNA plasmid encoding eight HLA-A*0201-restricted 
      T-cell epitopes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis formulated in chitosan 
      nanoparticles. It was shown that the chitosan-DNA formulation was able to induce the 
      maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) while chitosan solution alone could not, 
      indicating the DNA was released from the particles and able to stimulate DCs. 
      Pulmonary administration of the DNA plasmid incorporated in chitosan nanoparticles 
      was shown to induce increased levels of IFN-gamma secretion compared to pulmonary 
      delivery of plasmid in solution or the more frequently used intramuscular 
      immunization route. These results indicate that pulmonary delivery of DNA vaccines 
      against tuberculosis may provide an advantageous delivery route compared to 
      intramuscular immunization, and that increased immunogenicity can be achieved by 
      delivery of this DNA encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles.

TI  - Immunological and virological interactions in patients receiving passive 
      immunotherapy with HIV-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.
PG  - 940-51
AB  - Mouse monoclonal antibodies with high human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
      neutralizing titers were used for passive immunotherapy of eleven late-state 
      HIV-infected patients. In five patients the serum level of the core protein p24 
      decreased, while in five cases it remained unchanged. The level of viral RNA in 
      plasma as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) decreased in four 
      cases, was stable in another four, and increased in three cases. An anti-mouse 
      (HAMA) response developed in eight patients and anti-idiotypic antibodies appeared 
      in six. Immune complexes that formed in patient sera during the treatment were shown 
      to contain mostly envelope glycoprotein gp120 which decreased in nine of the eleven 
      treated patients toward the end of treatment. Antibodies inhibiting gp120 binding to 
      CD4 became detectable or increased in six patients during immunotherapy. Serology of 
      the HIV-1 V3 region was studied for both the HIV-1 IIIB and MN strains with no or 
      very small changes in titer or avidity after treatment. No change in neutralizing 
      titers to strain HTLVIIIB was observed in serum samples collected before and after 
      treatment was terminated. In nine of the eleven patients stimulation of the T 
      lymphocytes to proliferate in vitro when activated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was 
      shown to be increased compared to before treatment. Increased T-cell proliferation 
      was also noted with several antigens such as HIV-1 recombinant antigens, 
      cytomegalovirus (CMV), tetanus toxoid (TT), and purified protein derivate of 
      mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD). These findings indicate a decreased total gp120 
      content in serum, permitting better T-cell activation.

TI  - Are the PE-PGRS proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis variable surface antigens?
PG  - 9-19
AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv contains 67 PE-PGRS genes, with multiple tandem 
      repetitive sequences, encoding closely related proteins that are exceptionally rich 
      in glycine and alanine. As no functional information was available, 10 of these 
      genes were selected and shown to be expressed in vitro by reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Antibodies against five PE-PGRS 
      proteins, raised in mice by DNA vaccination, detected single proteins when the same 
      plasmid constructs used for immunization were expressed in epithelial cells or in 
      reticulocyte extracts, confirming that the PE-PGRS proteins are antigenic. As 
      expected from the conserved repetitive structure, the antibodies cross-reacted with 
      more than one PE-PGRS protein, suggesting that different proteins share common 
      epitopes. PE-PGRS proteins were detected by West-ern blotting in five different 
      mycobacterial species (M. tuberculosis, M. bovis BCG, M. smegmatis, M. marinum and 
      M. gordonae) and 11 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. Whole-genome comparisons 
      of M. tuberculosis predicted allelic diversity in the PE-PGRS family, and this was 
      confirmed by immunoblot studies as size variants were detected in clinical strains. 
      Subcellular fractionation studies and immunoelectron microscopy localized many 
      PE-PGRS proteins in the cell wall and cell membrane of M. tuberculosis. The data 
      suggest that some PE-PGRS proteins are variable surface antigens.

TI  - Tuberculous spondylitis diagnosed through Xpert MTB/RIF assay in urine: a case 
      report.
PG  - 514
LID - 514
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is associated with high rates of 
      morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of EPTB is challenging in resource-limited 
      settings due to difficulties in obtaining samples, as well as the paucibacillarity 
      of the specimens. Skeletal tuberculosis accounts for 10-35 % of EPTB cases, with 
      vertebral osteomyelitis (Pott's disease) representing 50 % of the cases. We present 
      two cases of suspected Pott's disease, diagnosed through GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay in 
      urine at a rural Tanzanian hospital. CASE PRESENTATION: Case I A 49-year old male, 
      HIV-1 positive, on co-formulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine/efavirenz 
      since 2009 and CD4 counts of 205 cells/μL (13 %). He presented with lower back pain 
      and progressive lower limb weakness for two weeks prior to admission. The physical 
      examination revealed bilateral flaccid paraplegia with reduced reflexes, but 
      otherwise unremarkable findings. A lateral lumbar X-ray showed noticeable reduction 
      of intervertebral space between L4 and L5, and a small calcification in the anterior 
      longitudinal ligament between L4 and L5, being compatible with focal spondylosis 
      deformans but inconclusive with regard to tuberculous spondylitis. An abdominal 
      ultrasound showed normal kidneys, bladder and prostate gland. The urinalysis and 
      complete blood counts (CBC) were normal. M. Tuberculosis was detected through 
      GeneXpert MTB/RIF in centrifuged urine, with no resistance to rifampicin. Case II A 
      76-year old female, HIV-1 negative, presented with lower back pain and progressive 
      weakness and numbness of the lower limbs for two months prior to admission. The 
      physical examination revealed paraplegia, but otherwise unremarkable findings. The 
      lumbosacral X-ray findings were compatible with spondylosis deformans of the lumbar 
      spine and possible tuberculous spondylitis in L3-L4. The abdominal and renal 
      ultrasound showed normal kidneys and bladder. The urinalysis and CBC were normal. M. 
      Tuberculosis was detected through GeneXpert MTB/RIF in centrifuged urine, with no 
      resistance to rifampicin. CONCLUSION: We report two cases of suspected tuberculous 
      spondylitis diagnosed through Xpert MTB/RIF in urine samples from a rural Tanzanian 
      hospital. Urine testing using Xpert MTB/RIF reflects disseminated disease and renal 
      involvement, and may offer a feasible additional diagnostic approach for Pott's 
      disease in rural Africa.

TI  - Disruption of Intestinal Homeostasis and Intestinal Microbiota During Experimental 
      Autoimmune Uveitis.
PG  - 420-429
LID - 10.1167/iovs.18-24813 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We determine the changes in intestinal microbiota and/or disruptions in 
      intestinal homeostasis during uveitis. METHODS: Experimental autoimmune uveitis 
      (EAU) was induced in B10.RIII mice with coadministration of interphotoreceptor 
      retinoid-binding protein peptide (IRBP) and killed mycobacterial antigen (MTB) as an 
      adjuvant. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we looked at intestinal microbial 
      differences during the course of uveitis, as well as intestinal morphologic changes, 
      changes in intestinal permeability by FITC-dextran leakage, antimicrobial peptide 
      expression in the gastrointstinal tract, and T lymphocyte prevalence before and at 
      peak intraocular inflammation. RESULTS: We demonstrate that increased intestinal 
      permeability and antimicrobial peptide expression in the intestinal tract coincide 
      in timing with increased effector T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes, during the 
      early stages of uveitis, before peak inflammation. Morphologic changes in the 
      intestine were most prominent during this phase, but also occurred with adjuvant MTB 
      alone, whereas increased intestinal permeability was found only in IRBP-immunized 
      mice that develop uveitis. We also demonstrate that the intestinal microbiota were 
      altered during the course of uveitis, and that some of these changes are specific to 
      uveitic animals, whereas others are influenced by adjuvant MTB alone. Intestinal 
      permeability peaked at 2 weeks, coincident with an increase in intestinal bacterial 
      strain differences, peak lipocalin production, and peak uveitis. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      intestinal dysbiosis accompanies a disruption in intestinal homeostasis in 
      autoimmune uveitis, although adjuvant MTB alone promotes intestinal disruption as 
      well. This may indicate a novel axis for future therapeutic targeting experimentally 
      or clinically.

TI  - Direct identification of slowly growing Mycobacterium species by analysis of the 
      intergenic 16S-23S rDNA spacer region (ISR) using a GelCompar II database containing 
      sequence based optimization for restriction fragment site polymorphisms (RFLPs) for 
      12 enzymes.
PG  - 185-99
AB  - To obtain Mycobacterium species identification directly from clinical specimens and 
      cultures, the 16S-23S rDNA spacer (ISR) was amplified using previously published 
      primers that detect all Mycobacterium species. The restriction enzyme that could 
      potentially produce the most restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) was 
      determined from all available ISR DNA sequences in GenBank to produce a novel data 
      set of RFLPs for 31 slowly growing Mycobacterium species. Subsequently a GelCompar 
      II database was constructed from RFLPs for 10 enzymes that have been used in the 
      literature to differentiate slowly growing Mycobacterium species. The combination of 
      Sau96I and HaeIII were the best choice of enzymes for differentiating clinically 
      relevant slowly growing Mycobacterium species. A total of 392 specimens were studied 
      by PCR with 195 negative and 197 positive specimens. The ISR-PCR product was 
      digested with HaeIII (previously reported) and Sau96I (new to this study) to obtain 
      a Mycobacterium species identification based on the ISR-RFLPs. The species 
      identification obtained by ISR-RFLP was confirmed by DNA sequencing (isolate numbers 
      are shown in parentheses) for M. avium (3), M. intracellulare (4), M. avium complex 
      (1), M. gordonae (2) and M. tuberculosis (1). The total number of specimens (99) 
      identified were from culture (67), Bactectrade mark 12B culture bottles (11), EDTA 
      blood (3), directly from smear positive specimens (13), tissue (4) and urine (1). 
      Direct species identification was obtained from all 13/13 smear positive specimens. 
      The total number of specimens (99) were identified as M. tuberculosis (41), M. avium 
      (7), M. avium complex (11), M. intracellulare MIN-A (20), M. flavescens (2), M. 
      fortuitum (10), M. gordonae (4), M. shimoidei (1), M. ulcerans (1) and M. chelonae 
      (2). This method reduces the time taken for Mycobacterium species identification 
      from 8-10 weeks for culture and biochemical identification; to 4-6 weeks for culture 
      and ISR-RFLP; to 2 days for smear-positive specimens by ISR-RFLP. The precise 2 day 
      identification obtained may provide significant advantages in clinical management.

TI  - Immunization with recombinant Calmette-Guerin bacillus (BCG)-hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
      elicits HCV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in mice.
PG  - 3149-56
AB  - Since virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a critical role in 
      preventing the spread of hepatitis C virus (HCV), an effective HCV vaccine should be 
      capable of eliciting HCV-specific CTLs. In the present study, we assessed the 
      capability of a novel recombinant vaccine using an attenuated tuberculosis bacillus, 
      Calmette-Guerin bacillus (BCG), as a vaccine vehicle to elicit HCV-specific CTLs. 
      BCG was engineered to express the CTL epitope of HCV-non-structure protein 5a (NS5a) 
      as a chimeric protein with alpha antigen of mycobacteria. Immunization with this 
      recombinant BCG elicited major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted CD8(+) 
      HCV-NS5a-specific CTLs in mice. Immunized mice showed a substantial reduction in the 
      vaccinia virus titer compared with control mice when the immunized mice were 
      challenged with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing HCV-NS5a genes. These 
      findings provide evidences for the possibility of BCG as a vaccine vector and its 
      continued exploration as a vehicle for eliciting HCV-specific immunity.

TI  - Disruption of nuclear factor-interleukin-6, a transcription factor, results in 
      severe mycobacterial infection.
PG  - 361-6
AB  - Nuclear factor-interleukin-6 (NF-IL-6) is one of several nuclear transcription 
      factors (NF-IL-6, NF-kappaB, PU.1, interferon-regulatory factor 1, Egr-1, and 
      Stat-1). NF-IL-6 and NF-kappaB are expressed in macrophages and is induced by 
      bacterial lipopolysaccharides. To evaluate whether NF-IL-6 is required for the 
      inflammatory immune response to mycobacterial infection, in which epithelioid 
      macrophages comprise the leading cell population, we generated NF-IL-6 knockout (KO) 
      mutant mice. Airborne infection of these mice with Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      strains induced disseminated tuberculosis lacking granuloma formation, although 
      interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-12 mRNA expression 
      levels were within the normal range compared with those of wild-type mice. 
      Generation of O2- and mycobacterial killing by neutrophils from these mice were 
      impaired severely compared with wild-type mice. We conclude that NF-IL-6 is a 
      critical transcription factor in mycobacterial control as well as in 
      granulocyte-colony stimulating factor induction resulting in neutrophil activation.

TI  - [Clinical Application of Plasma miR-34b-3p and miR-302a-5p in the Diagnosis of 
      Non-small Cell Lung Cancer].
PG  - 216-222
LID - 10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2019.04.03 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNA is a kind of single-stranded non-coding RNA whose length is 
      about 22 nucleotides and its abnormal expression is related to disease closely. This 
      study is aiming to explore the relative expression of miR-34b-3p and miR-302a-5p in 
      the plasma of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and its clinical value. 
      METHODS: The levels of miR-34b-3p and miR-302a-5p in plasma were detected by 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 86 patients with NSCLC, 64 patients 
      with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and 39 healthy subjects. Analyze their value in 
      diagnosing NSCLC by contrasting and combining carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), 
      neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and cytokeratin 19 fragments 21-1 (CYFRA21-1). 
      RESULTS: The levels of plasma miR-34b-3p and miR-302a-5p in NSCLC group were 
      significantly higher than those in the PTB group and the healthy group (P<0.05). In 
      patients with NSCLC, the levels of plasma miR-34b-3p was correlated with the 
      diameter of tumor (P<0.01). When using one plasma marker to diagnose NSCLC, 
      miR-302a-5p had the highest sensitivity (82.6%) and CEA had the highest specificity 
      (81.6%). While combined two plasma markers, miR-34b-3p+miR-302a-5p had the highest 
      sensitivity (80.2%) and miR-34b-3p+CEA had the highest specificity (81.4%). As 
      detected multiple markers, miR-302a-5p+NSE+CYFRA21-1 had the highest sensitivity 
      (81.4%) and miR-34b-3p+CEA+NSE had the highest specificity (90.3%). The combination 
      of miR-34b-3p, miR-302a-5p and CEA obtained the highest area under the curve (AUC), 
      which was 0.832. Logistic regression model indicated that miR-34b-3p was independent 
      risk factor for NSCLC compared to control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma miR-34b-3p and 
      miR-302a-5p could be used as biological markers for the diagnosis of NSCLC.

PG  - 285-95
AB  - The presence of several Mycobacterium species was determined in 68 New World monkeys 
      kept captive in the Cali Zoo. One hundred and thirty-three gastric lavage and blood 
      samples were evaluated for mycobacterial presence by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining, 
      culture and PCR amplification of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Mtp40 
      species-specific gene. Mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT) were identified 
      by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Different species of 
      mycobacteria were detected in 65% of the primate population studied by Alpha Antigen 
      PCR. Eleven percent were positive for Mtp40 PCR amplification, being diagnosed as 
      having M. tuberculosis, and acid-fast bacilli were observed in 23% by ZN staining. 
      MOTT were isolated from samples taken from 37 primates by culturing; according to 
      the RFLP analysis, three strains were classified as belonging to the MAISS complex 
      (Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare-scrofulaceum-simiae) and eight more, isolated 
      from soil inside the cages, were categorized as environmental contaminants. 
      Mycobacterium spp. were detected in 13 different New World primate species showing 
      that PCR amplification of the Mtp40 gene is a better tool than culture for M. 
      tuberculosis detection in captive animals and that RFLP is a useful technique for 
      MOTT identification.

TI  - Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1RA) gene polymorphism and levels associated 
      with adverse outcome in severe community-acquired pneumonia in children: A 
      hospital-based study in India.
PG  - 1276-1283
LID - 10.1002/ppul.24090 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: High morbidity and mortality due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) 
      is seen in children under 5 years of age in India. Besides identified risk factors 
      for CAP, there may be a phenotype-genotype association with cytokines, resulting in 
      enhanced inflammatory response resulting in the adverse outcome (AO), namely 
      complications and death. AIM: To assess the association of IL1RA gene polymorphism 
      on serum levels of IL1RA and with AO in children under 5 years of age hospitalized 
      with WHO-defined severe CAP. METHOD: A prospective cohort study with nested 
      case-control design conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital after obtaining 
      institutional ethical approval. Included were children between 2 and 59 months of 
      age hospitalized with WHO-defined severe CAP with consistent radiological 
      abnormalities. Excluded were those with suspected or proven cystic fibrosis, 
      pulmonary tuberculosis, malignancy, immunodeficiency, and congenital heart disease. 
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyze the Variable Number of Tandem 
      Repeats (VNTRs) of IL1RA gene polymorphism and ELISA test to detect serum levels of 
      IL1RA. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2016, of 420 screened cases, 350 were eligible and 
      included, of which 132 (37.7%) had no complication and 218 (62.3%) had AO, which 
      included complications like empyema, pyopneumothorax, acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome (ARDS), and septic shock of these 24 (6.9%) expired. Higher risk of AO was 
      seen in A2A2 genotype (OR 11.18, p 0.0001) and lower in A1A1 genotype (OR 0.18, 
      P < 0.0001). Serum IL1RA (ng/mL) was statistically significantly elevated in CAP 
      with AO (2.55 ± 1.44) versus uncomplicated (0.87 ± 0.52) (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: 
      In IL1RA gene, A1A1 genotype was associated with lower risk and A2A2 genotype with 
      increased the risk of AO. Higher serum levels of IL1RA were found in A2A2 genotype 
      indicating possibly enhanced inflammatory response resulting in AO of CAP.

TI  - An assessment of zoonotic and production limiting pathogens in rusa deer (Cervus 
      timorensis rusa) from Mauritius.
PG  - 31-42
LID - 10.1111/tbed.12206 [doi]
AB  - A population of approximately 70,000 rusa deer (Cervus timorensis russa) represents 
      the most important mammal species reared for food on the island of Mauritius, being 
      the main source of red meat for the local population. However, very limited 
      information is available on the circulation of pathogens affecting the productivity 
      and health of this species. To produce baseline data on the circulation of 
      infectious pathogens in rusa deer under production, a serological survey and/or 
      direct pathogen detection for six selected infectious diseases was undertaken in 
      2007 in a sample of 53% of the herds reared in semi-free-ranging conditions in 
      hunting estates. Seropositive results were recorded for Johne's disease with an 
      indirect ELISA test (1.7%, n = 351), heartwater with an immunofluorescence antibody 
      test (IFAT) (95.5%, n = 178) and leptospirosis with a Microscopic Agglutination Test 
      (MAT) (25.9%, n = 363). Significant associations were found between seroprevalence 
      to some of the leptospiral serogroups detected (Tarassovi, Pomona, Sejroe and Mini) 
      and age of the animals, animal density or location of the estates (being more 
      prevalent in hotter and more humid areas). In addition, Mycobacterium bovis and M. 
      avium subspecies paratuberculosis were confirmed in two deer carcasses by culture 
      and PCR, respectively. No antibodies against Brucella spp. nor Rift Valley Fever 
      virus were detected with the use of respective indirect ELISA's. The results 
      obtained suggest that the population of rusa deer from Mauritius is exposed to a 
      wide range of pathogens which may affect their productivity. In addition, the 
      results highlight the potential public health risks incurred by deer industry 
      workers and consumers. This survey fills an important gap in knowledge regarding the 
      health of tropical deer meat in Mauritius and justifies the need to implement more 
      regular surveys of selected pathogens in the deer population.

TI  - Identification of Francisella tularensis by both culture and real-time TaqMan PCR 
      methods from environmental water specimens in outbreak areas where tularemia cases 
      were not previously reported.
PG  - 2353-7
LID - 10.1007/s10096-012-1576-z [doi]
AB  - Tularemia is an endemic disease in Turkey. In this study, we aimed to detect 
      Francisella tularensis by two methods from natural water supplies thought to cause 
      tularemia epidemiologically. A total of 154 water specimens from three different 
      outbreaks caused by drinking water were collected. Water specimens were cultured on 
      antibiotic-added cysteine heart agar base with blood and incubated at 37°C in a 
      humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO(2) for 4-10 days. The suspected colonies were 
      confirmed by F. tularensis antiserum (BD) and the real-time TaqMan polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) method. DNA was isolated from samples obtained from filters. The 
      primer and probe sets targeting the ISFtu2 genome were used. A total of four F. 
      tularensis isolates were obtained from 154 water samples. At the same time, the 
      presence of F. tularensis DNA from 17 water specimens was shown by the real-time 
      TaqMan PCR method. Although the DNA presence of F. tularensis has been detected from 
      water sources by the PCR method in Turkey up to now, there has been no isolation 
      directly from water specimens by culture. In this study, the determination of F. 
      tularensis from water sources has been exhibited as the first data by both culture 
      and real-time TaqMan PCR methods.

TI  - Spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome may mimic aseptic meningitis.
PG  - 481-8
LID - 10.3109/00365548.2012.664776 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is recognized with increasing 
      frequency. A throbbing headache occurring or worsening in the upright position and 
      improving after lying down, a so-called 'orthostatic headache', low cerebrospinal 
      fluid (CSF) pressure, and diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement on brain magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) are the major features of the classic syndrome. These 
      patients, who are admitted with fever, headache, and CSF findings revealing 
      lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein concentration, normal glucose levels, and 
      negative culture results, are prone to be misdiagnosed with aseptic meningitis. The 
      aims of this single-centre retrospective study were to determine the 
      epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features of patients 
      initially evaluated as having aseptic meningitis but subsequently diagnosed with 
      SIH, and to touch upon the key points of the differential diagnosis in daily 
      infectious diseases practice. METHODS: Patients referred to Cerrahpasa Medical 
      School with a presumed diagnosis of aseptic meningitis or viral meningitis between 1 
      January 2006 and 1 January 2011 were reviewed. Epidemiological, clinical, 
      laboratory, radiological, and follow-up data obtained from the hospital database 
      were processed. Patients confirmed to have SIH syndrome were included for 
      evaluation. RESULTS: Eleven cases of SIH syndrome were diagnosed during the study 
      period (8 male and 3 female, median age 30 y, range 21-44 y). All had headache, 
      hearing changes, and nausea. Vomiting (10/11) and posterior neck pain (9/11) were 
      also frequent. Seven had fever and 5 had a stiff neck. Four cases had lymphocytic 
      pleocytosis, 4 cases had elevated CSF protein concentrations (> 1.5 times the upper 
      limit of normal), and 2 cases had slightly lower CSF glucose levels. Polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) analyses of the CSF for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, 
      herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, and enteroviruses were negative in all cases. MRI of 
      the 11 cases revealed signs of spontaneous CSF leaks with diffuse pachymeningeal 
      gadolinium enhancement (11/11), sagging of the brain (9/11), enlargement of the 
      pituitary (6/11), engorgement of the venous structures (5/11), and subdural fluid 
      collections (2/11). CSF leaks were demonstrated by intrathecal magnetic resonance or 
      computed tomography myelography at different levels along the thoracic spine (7/11), 
      cervico-thoracic junction (2/11), and thoraco-lumbar junction (2/11). Autologous 
      blood injection into the spinal epidural space ('blood patch') was performed for 
      treatment. Strict bed rest followed, and all patients recovered fully within a week; 
      no recurrence or complication was observed during the follow-up periods, which 
      ranged from 6 months to 5 y. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of fever, headache, and meningeal 
      irritation are generally accepted as the clinical features of meningitis. When CSF 
      findings are not characteristically compatible with bacterial meningitis and 
      particularly when the headache is orthostatic in nature, SIH should also be included 
      in the differential diagnosis. MRI findings are characteristic and clearly 
      contribute to the differential diagnosis between viral meningitis and SIH.

TI  - Interferon-gamma production in vitro from whole blood of foot-and-mouth disease 
      virus (FMDV) vaccinated and infected cattle after incubation with inactivated FMDV.
PG  - 964-9
AB  - Studies were performed to determine whether a rapid method to detect cell mediated 
      immune responses to foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) could be used either as a 
      diagnostic test or provide a correlate of protection in animals post-vaccination. 
      Using protocols based on the BOVIGAM assay for tuberculosis, whole blood samples 
      from FMDV vaccinated or control animals, before and after challenge infection, were 
      stimulated overnight with inactivated FMDV antigen. The quantity of interferon gamma 
      (IFN-gamma) produced in the supernatants was measured using an ELISA. Specific 
      induction of IFN-gamma was detected in samples from vaccinated, infected and 
      vaccinated-then-infected cattle. Further development of this assay may provide a 
      useful tool for the diagnosis of FMDV immune animals, including the identification 
      of vaccinated animals that have been subsequently infected with FMDV. In these 
      studies, combining the results of the IFN-gamma assay with virus neutralising 
      antibody titre, in groups of vaccinated animals, provided a correlation with the 
      capacity to control virus replication after subsequent challenge.

TI  - Orbital tuberculosis: a review of the literature.
PG  - 267-77
LID - 10.1080/01676830802225152 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To provide an up-to-date review of the clinical presentations, 
      investigations, and management of orbital tuberculosis (OTB). METHODS: Systematic 
      review of the literature concerning OTB, limiting the results to English-language 
      peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients from 39 publications were 
      identified as cases of OTB. The condition presents in one of five forms: classical 
      periostitis; orbital soft tissue tuberculoma or cold abscess, with no bony 
      involvement; OTB with bony involvement; spread from the paranasal sinuses; and 
      tuberculous dacryoadenitis. The ocular adnexa, including the nasolacrimal system and 
      overlying skin, may also be involved. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis can be difficult and 
      may necessitate an orbital biopsy, in which acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and 
      characteristic histopathology may be seen. Growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      (mTB) from such a specimen remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Ancillary 
      investigations include tuberculin skin tests and chest radiography, but more 
      recently alternatives such as whole blood interferon-gamma immunological tests and 
      PCR-based tests of pathological specimens have proven useful. The management of OTB 
      is complex, requiring a stringent public health strategy and high levels of patient 
      adherence, combined with long courses of multiple anti-tuberculous medications. The 
      interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with TB may further complicate 
      management.

TI  - T-lymphocyte cytokine mRNA expression in cystic echinococcosis.
PG  - 35-51
AB  - In the present study we investigated cytokine mRNA expression by peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with cystic echinococcosis (CE) after 
      stimulation with different antigens. By using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR) we could demonstrate that restimulation with crude Echinococcus 
      granulosus antigen (Eg-Ag) induced or enhanced Th2 cytokine mRNA expression, 
      especially IL-5 (by using antigen from sheep cyst fluid) in 23 out of 26 
      investigated CE patients and IL-10 (by using antigen from camel cyst fluid) in 10 
      out of 10 investigated CE patients. In contrast, IL-5 mRNA expression was absent in 
      PBMC of healthy controls after Eg-Ag stimulation. To determine the specificity of 
      this reaction we stimulated PBMC from 11 CE patients with crude Echinococcus 
      multilocularis antigen (Em-Ag) and PBMC from 8 CE patients with Toxocara canis 
      antigen (Tc-Ag). We found that the PBMC of patients showed a similar mRNA cytokine 
      pattern on stimulation with Em-Ag when compared with Eg-Ag stimulation. The cytokine 
      mRNA pattern on stimulation with Tc-Ag, however, resembled the cytokine mRNA pattern 
      of unstimulated PBMC. Furthermore, the stimulation of PBMC with crude Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis antigen (H37Ra) and purified protein derivative (PPD) of M. 
      tuberculosis revealed distinct IL-5 mRNA expression in all investigated CE patients, 
      whereas in healthy controls IL-5 mRNA expression was very weak or totally absent. 
      Thus, our results indicate an induction of Th2 cytokine mRNA expression in CE 
      patients, which is frequently observed in parasite infections. Interestingly, this 
      response persists after stimulation with tuberculosis antigens, which normally 
      induce Th1 response.

TI  - A passenger strand variant in miR-196a2 contributes to asthma severity in children 
      and adolescents: A preliminary study.
PG  - 347-57
LID - 10.1139/bcb-2016-0010 [doi]
AB  - There is emerging evidence to support the role of microRNAs in allergic airway 
      diseases and inflammation. Genetic variants in microRNA genes might affect 
      microRNA-mediated cell regulation. This preliminary study was designed to 
      investigate the association of the microRNA-196a2 rs11614913 (C/T) polymorphism with 
      susceptibility to asthma and clinical outcomes in children and adolescents. 
      Genotyping of rs11614913 polymorphism was determined in 96 patients with bronchial 
      asthma (6-18 years of age) and 96 unrelated controls, using real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction technology. In-silico target prediction and network core analyses 
      were performed. The asthmatics did not show significant differences in genotype 
      distribution (p = 0.609) and allele frequencies (p = 0.428) compared with the 
      controls. There were also no associations with disease duration, age at onset, 
      asthma phenotype, asthma control, therapeutic level, airway hyper-responsiveness, or 
      biochemical parameters in the blood. However, the CC genotype was associated with a 
      more severe degree of asthma (p = 0. 023) and higher frequency of nocturnal asthma 
      (p = 0.002). Carriers for CC were 17 times more likely to develop nocturnal asthma, 
      and had a more than 2.5-fold increased risk for poor disease outcome compared with 
      CT and TT individuals. In conclusion, microRNA-196a2 rs11614913 polymorphism might 
      be associated with asthma severity in our sample of the Egyptian population. Further 
      investigations in studies with a larger sample size and functional tests are needed 
      to validate our findings and to explore the detailed biological mechanisms.

TI  - The CD40-CD40L axis and IFN-γ play critical roles in Langhans giant cell formation.
PG  - 5-15
LID - 10.1093/intimm/dxr088 [doi]
AB  - The presence of Langhans giant cells (LGCs) is one of the signatures of systemic 
      granulomatous disorders such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis. However, the 
      pathophysiological mechanism leading to LGC formation, especially the contribution 
      of the T cells abundantly found in granulomas, has not been fully elucidated. To 
      examine the role of T cells in LGC formation, a new in vitro method for the 
      induction of LGCs was developed by co-culturing human monocytes with autologous T 
      cells in the presence of concanavalin A (ConA). This system required close contact 
      between monocytes and T cells, and CD4+ T cells were more potent than CD8+ T cells 
      in inducing LGC formation. Antibody inhibition revealed that a CD40-CD40 ligand 
      (CD40L) interaction and IFN-γ were essential for LGC formation, and the combination 
      of exogenous soluble CD40L (sCD40L) and IFN-γ efficiently replaced the role of T 
      cells. Dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), a known 
      fusion-related molecule in monocytes, was up-regulated during LGC formation. 
      Moreover, knock-down of DC-STAMP by siRNA inhibited LGC formation, revealing that 
      DC-STAMP was directly involved in LGC formation. Taken together, these results 
      demonstrate that T cells played a pivotal role in a new in vitro LGC formation 
      system, in which DC-STAMP was involved, and occurred via a molecular mechanism that 
      involved CD40-CD40L interaction and IFN-γ secretion.

TI  - Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-specific CD4+ T lymphocyte response in AIDS patients 
      with no past or current HCMV disease following HAART.
PG  - 308-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) end-organ disease has 
      dramatically decreased since the implementation of highly active antiretroviral 
      therapies (HAARTs), but the precise immune mechanism whereby HCMV is controlled 
      remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of (HAART) on CD4+ 
      T-cell immunity to HCMV in AIDS patients with no past or current HCMV disease. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Seventeen patients were prospectively examined for CD4+ (CD45RO+ and CD45 
      RA+) T-cell counts (flow cytometry), HIV RNA load (Amplicor HIV test), HCMV 
      leukoDNAemia and HCMV DNA in urine (nested PCR), lymphoproliferative response (LPR) 
      to HCMV, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and purified protein derived from Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (PPD) by measurement of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation to DNA 
      (ELISA) and cytokine secretion (IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10) by HCMV-stimulated 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures (ELISA). RESULTS: Fifteen patients 
      responded favorably to HAART (virologically, immunologically, or both). Of these, 
      six patients presented LPR to HCMV at least once during follow-up, whereas most 
      displayed detectable LPRs to PHA. IFN-gamma was detected at least once in 
      supernatants of HCMV-stimulated PBMC cultures from 14 of the 17 patients. All but 
      one patient tested negative for HCMV leukoDNAemia and HCMV DNA in urine, and none 
      developed HCMV disease during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: Control of HCMV 
      replication and the absence of HCMV disease are not consistently associated with 
      recovery and/or maintenance of LPR to HCMV in AIDS patients under HAART and with no 
      prior HCMV disease. Whether detection of IFN-gamma by PBMCs upon HCMV antigenic 
      stimulation may serve as a surrogate marker for protection against HCMV disease 
      requires further investigation.

TI  - Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia characteristics: first report from Iran.
PG  - 513-521
LID - 10.1007/s10238-018-0520-7 [doi]
AB  - Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) is the infrequent type of acute leukemia 
      characterized by immunophenotypic and/or cytochemical features of both lineages, but 
      the diagnosis of this disease still is a challenge. In this study, we analyzed 
      immunophenotyping, cytochemistry and frequency of MPAL patients to better diagnosis 
      of MPAL characteristics according to WHO 2016 criteria for the first time in Iran. 
      In this retrospective study, 27 patients were diagnosed as MPAL based on WHO 2016 
      criteria during 2014-2017. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping was performed on PB and 
      BM samples evaluation of different CD marker expressions in MPAL subsets. RT-PCR was 
      performed for the analyses of BCR/ABL1 fusion in MPAL subsets. Among 27 cases, 
      (70.4%) 19 cases were B + My, (22.22%) 6 cases were T + My, and 2 cases (7.40%) were 
      B + T + My. CD34, CD19, HLA-DR, TdT, CD22, iMPO were positive in majority of B + My 
      cases. CD45, iMPO, iCD3, CD7, CD2 and CD5 were positive in majority of T + My cases. 
      HLA-DR, TdT, CD10, CD22, iCD79a, iMPO, CD45, iCD3, CD7, CD3, CD2, CD5 were positive 
      in majority of B + T + My cases. BCR/ABL1 fusion was positive for 3 cases (11.1%) of 
      p190 fusion and 2 cases (7.4%) of p210 fusion in B + My cases. WHO 2016 criteria are 
      the current standard for diagnosing MPAL. Also, evaluation of TdT, CD2, CD5, CD7 
      expressions by flow cytometry in EGIL criteria is useful for the better diagnosis of 
      MPAL subsets. In addition, evaluation of BCR/ABL1 and MLL rearrangements in patients 
      should be part of standard work-up in MPAL.

AB  - A 75 year old man was hospitalized because of rapid deterioration of his general 
      condition, weight loss, night sweat and subfebrile temperature. The patient 
      presented with severely reduced general condition, tachyarrythmia with previously 
      known atrial fibrillation. Laboratory investigations revealed among others a 
      moderately increased CRP-value, normal sedimentation rate and, initially, a normal 
      white cell count. The differential diagnosis included neoplastic and infectious 
      diseases (i.e. endocarditis, tuberculosis), endocrinopathies (i.e. thyreoditis) and 
      general inflammatory or rheumatic diseases. An initially increased CMV-IgM-titer, a 
      rising anti CMV IgG-titer and gradually developing atypical lymphocytosis in 
      particular suggested diagnosis of severe CMV-infection. The diagnosis was confirmed 
      by PCR positive for CMV-DNA in blood. The course of a CMV-primary infection may 
      develop from asymptomatic infection over a mononucleosis-like syndrome to 
      disseminated CMV-infection with multi organ involvement.

TI  - Gene therapy of arthritis with TCR isolated from the inflamed paw.
PG  - 8140-7
AB  - In recent years, the treatment of autoimmune diseases has been significantly 
      advanced by the use of biological agents. However, some biologics are accompanied 
      with severe side effects, including tuberculosis and other types of infection. There 
      is thus a critical need for nonsystemic and lesion-specific methods of delivering 
      these therapeutic agents. We attempted to treat a mouse model of arthritis by using 
      T cells that expressed a regulatory molecule and were specifically directed to the 
      inflamed paw. To this end, we first identified the TCR alphabeta genes accumulating 
      in the inflamed paw of mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) by a combination 
      of single-strand chain polymorphism analysis of TCR and single-cell sorting. We 
      identified an expanded clone B47 which is autoreactive but is not specific to type 
      II collagen. In vivo, TCR genes from B47-transduced T cells accumulated in the 
      inflamed paw. Injection of cells cotransduced with the B47 and soluble TNFRIg genes 
      resulted in a significant suppression of CIA. The suppression was correlated with 
      the amount of TNFRIg transcripts in the hind paw, not with the serum concentrations 
      of TNFRIg. Moreover, T cells cotransduced with the B47 and intracellular Foxp3 genes 
      significantly suppressed CIA with reductions in TNF-alpha, IL-17A, and IL-1beta 
      expression and bone destruction. T cells cotransduced with B47 and Foxp3 genes also 
      suppressed the progression of established CIA. Therefore, immunosuppressive therapy 
      with autoreactive TCR is a promising therapeutic strategy for arthritis whether the 
      TCRs are used to deliver either soluble or intracellular suppressive molecules.

TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of central nervous system infections.
PG  - 1047-71
AB  - The laboratory diagnosis of CNS infection is essential for optimal therapy. Acute 
      infection requires rapid turn-around testing with high predictive values, that is, 
      the ability of a test to accurately identify those patients who do or do not have 
      disease caused by a specific etiology. The Gram's stain, fungal stains of direct 
      smears, antigen testing for C. neoformans, and culture of bacteria, fungi, 
      mycobacteria, and some viruses are important tests for the diagnosis of acute 
      infection. The laboratory diagnosis of chronic infection necessitates discussion 
      between the clinician and laboratory technician to allow triaging of testing. 
      Antigen tests for bacteria, fungi, and viruses; antibody tests for multiple 
      microorganisms; and PCR testing for bacteria, M. tuberculosis, and many viruses are 
      all important in limited clinical situations. All testing for acute or chronic 
      disease depends on sufficient specimen that is transported to the laboratory in a 
      manner that will not compromise viability or chemical integrity. Sterile containers 
      that maintain moisture content, exclude oxygen for anaerobic requests, and are 
      stored at proper temperatures (22 degrees C room, 4 degrees C refrigeration, or -20 
      degrees C freezer depending on pathogen and test) are mandatory. Many laboratory 
      issues addressing the diagnosis of CNS infection are changing or evolving. Most 
      important is the recognition that bacterial antigen testing for the diagnosis of 
      acute bacterial meningitis rarely impacts patient management and is not routinely 
      needed, CSF shunt infections differ from usual meningeal infections and require 
      rapid diagnosis, and TB meningitis remains a difficult disease to diagnosis but may 
      be confirmed first by PCR testing of CSF. In addition, Whipple's disease of the CNS 
      can be confirmed using PCR with CSF; CJD has a marker protein, referred to as 14-3-3 
      antigen, that can be detected in CSF, and the diagnosis of fungal CNS disease 
      requires careful interpretation of direct smears, antigen and antibody testing, and 
      culture. Most difficult to diagnose among the CNS infections are viral meningitis 
      and encephalitis. The appearance of new etiologies, such as West Nile virus, and the 
      common use of PCR for the herpes viruses and enteroviruses represent important 
      advances. Evolving methods for the laboratory diagnosis of CNS infection represent 
      significant improvements over previous testing; however, the array of tests 
      available demands more attention for appropriate selection, is significantly more 
      expensive, and requires new skills for performance and interpretation. The 
      responsibility for proper use of laboratory testing lies both with the clinician and 
      laboratory technician.

TI  - A predominance of the T cell receptor V gamma 2/V delta 2 subset in human 
      mycobacteria-responsive T cells suggests germline gene encoded recognition.
PG  - 3360-9
AB  - Little is known about the nature of Ag recognition by the TCR-gamma delta. The 
      recent observation that gamma delta T cells preferentially recognize mycobacterial 
      Ag provides a model to examine the molecular basis of gamma delta-TCR recognition. 
      Here, examination of the Mycobacteria-stimulated peripheral blood T cells with 
      TCR-specific mAb revealed a predominance of T cells bearing V gamma 2/V delta 2 gene 
      products. PCR cloning and sequence analysis of the TCR chains demonstrated extensive 
      junctional diversity indicating that the response was polyclonal. The marked in 
      vitro gamma delta T cell response to Mycobacteria was also detected in newborns 
      before encounters with foreign Ag and exclusively involved the same V-gene usage 
      observed in adults. Together, these results suggest that a major mechanism of gamma 
      delta T cell reactivity involves recognition mediated by germline-encoded segments 
      of the TCR.

TI  - Identification of Mycobacterium leprae antigens from a cosmid library: 
      characterization of a 15-kilodalton antigen that is recognized by both the humoral 
      and cellular immune systems in leprosy patients.
PG  - 4117-24
AB  - Screening of the Mycobacterium leprae cosmid library with pooled sera from 
      lepromatous leprosy (LL) patients by a colony immunoblot technique resulted in the 
      identification of about 100 colonies that produced immunologically reactive 
      proteins. Twenty-four of these clones were purified, analyzed, and found to comprise 
      two groups according to the reactivity of the recombinant proteins with LL sera and 
      to the DNA restriction patterns of the recombinant plasmids and cosmids. Proteins 
      specified by clones from group I reacted strongly with LL patients' sera on a 
      Western blot (immunoblot), demonstrating a 15-kDa protein band designated A15. The 
      A15 antigen also reacted with pooled sera from patients with tuberculoid leprosy 
      from the United States and Brazil. Clones from group II did not show any reactive 
      protein band on a Western blot, when reacted with patients' sera. DNAs from cosmids 
      of group II all contain a 10-kb PstI fragment that hybridized to the unique 
      repetitive M. leprae DNA. Sequence analysis of a 1.2-kb fragment containing the 
      entire coding sequence of A15 revealed three open reading frames (ORFs), only one of 
      which (ORF II) contains sufficient genetic information to encode for A15. Part of 
      the A15 gene was found to exist also in a group of lambda gt11:M. leprae clones 
      previously isolated in our laboratory by immunological screening with LL patients' 
      sera. One of the lambda gt11 clones (L8) expresses a beta-galactosidase fusion 
      protein with 89 amino acids from the C terminus of A15. An important result was that 
      the fusion protein was clearly recognized by T cells from leprosy patients. 
      Interestingly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-stimulated T cells from M. leprae 
      nonresponder (LL as well as borderline tuberculoid) patients were able to respond to 
      the isolated recombinant M. leprae antigen, indicating that nonresponsiveness to M. 
      leprae antigens can be reversible. The sequence of the M. leprae DNA fused to the 
      beta-galactosidase gene of lambda gt11 clone L8 was identical to that of a lambda 
      gt11:M. leprae clone isolated recently that expresses an immunologically reactive 
      fusion protein (S. Laal, Y. D. Sharma, H. K. Prasad, A. Murtaza, S. Singh, S. 
      Tangri, R. Misra, and I. Nath, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:1054-1058, 1991). 
      Besides the complete sequence of the A15 gene, sequencing data of two flanking ORFs 
      are presented. Downstream from ORF II (A15), ORF III has a high degree of similarity 
      to the genes for tomato ATP-dependent proteases that are members of a larger class 
      of highly conserved proteases ubiquitous among prokaryotes and eukaryotes.(ABSTRACT

TI  - A recombinant cysteine proteinase from Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi suitable for 
      serodiagnosis of American visceral leishmaniasis.
PG  - 126-32
AB  - A recombinant protein, rLdccys1, which was produced by expression of the gene 
      encoding a 30 kDa cysteine proteinase from Leishmania (Leishmania) chagasi, was used 
      for detection of antibodies in sera from patients with active visceral leishmaniasis 
      (VL) in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Analysis of the predicted amino acid 
      sequence of rLdccys1 showed that it contains all the characteristics of a cysteine 
      proteinase. The ability of the protein to react with sera from humans with VL was 
      also shown by Western blotting. The sensitivity for detection of specific antibodies 
      to L. (L.) chagasi bodies using rLdccys1, L. (L.) chagasi promastigote lysates, and 
      amastigote lysates was 80%, 98%, and 99%, respectively. No cross-reactivity between 
      rLdccys1 and Chagas disease was observed, and there was little positive reactivity 
      with sera from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis and tuberculosis, compared with 
      promastigote and amastigote extracts. Our findings indicate that rLdccys1 from L. 
      (L.) chagasi constitutes a potential tool for the diagnosis of American VL.

TI  - CD137 ligand feedback upregulates PD-L1 expression on lung cancer via T cell 
      production of IFN-γ.
PG  - 2225-2235
LID - 10.1111/1759-7714.13207 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The expression of PD-L1 and its regulation in tumors remains unclear. 
      The importance of IFN-γ in upregulating the PD-L1 expression in various tumors, and 
      the effects of other essential cytokines in the tumor microenvironment (TME), need 
      to be further elucidated. METHODS: Constitutive expression of PD-L1 and CD137L in 
      all 13 lung cancer cell lines were tested by flow cytometry. CD137L mRNA of lung 
      cancer cell lines was detected by RT-PCR. PD-L1 expression rates following 
      stimulation with these cytokines (IFN-γ, TNFα and IL2) were measured. After 
      coculture of cells expressing CD137L (lung cancer cells or 293FT cells transfected 
      with CD137L plasmid) with T cells, the PDL1 expression of lung cancer cells and 
      IFN-γ in supernatant was detected. RESULTS: Our data revealed that adenocarcinoma 
      and squamous cell carcinoma cells had the highest positive expression rate. IFN-γ 
      was the core-inducing factor for enhancing the PD-L1 expression. CD137L was also 
      widely expressed in the lung cancer cell lines at the mRNA level, whereas its 
      expression was generally low at the protein level. However, the low expression of 
      CD137L protein was still enough to induce T cells to produce IFN-γ, which 
      subsequently increased the PD-L1 expression by lung cancer cells. The CD137 signal 
      induces IFN-γ secretion by T cells, which stimulates high-level of PD-L1 expression 
      in cancer cells; this negative immune regulation may represent a mechanism of immune 
      escape regulation. CONCLUSIONS: CD137L mRNA was widely expressed in lung cancer cell 
      lines whereas levels of protein expression were generally low. The low level of 
      CD137L protein was still enough to induce T cells to produce IFN-γ that subsequently 
      increased PD-L1 expression. The CD137L-induced negative immune regulation may 
      represent a mechanism of immune escape.

TI  - Recombinant guinea pig TNF-alpha enhances antigen-specific type 1 T lymphocyte 
      activation in guinea pig splenocytes.
PG  - 87-93
AB  - TNF-alpha is a principal pro-inflammatory cytokine which contributes to the 
      activation of innate immunity and the transition to antigen-specific adaptive 
      immunity in tuberculosis. Using recombinant guinea pig (rgp) TNF-alpha, the effect 
      of TNF-alpha on lymphocyte activation was examined in unvaccinated and 
      BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs. Splenocytes were stimulated with PPD or ConA, in the 
      presence or absence of rgp TNF-alpha for 96 h. Lymphocyte proliferation was measured 
      using [(3)H]thymidine uptake, and IL-12 p40 and IFN-gamma mRNA were analyzed using 
      real-time PCR. rgpTNF-alpha alone was able to stimulate a significant degree of 
      proliferation in splenocytes. The addition of rgpTNF-alpha to PPD-stimulated cells 
      enhanced the proliferation of splenocytes from BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs. 
      Furthermore, enhancement of proliferation by rgpTNF-alpha was found to be correlated 
      with upregulation of the levels of Type 1 cytokine mRNA (IL-12p40 and IFN-gamma) in 
      splenocyte cultures. This suggests that TNF-alpha plays an important role in the 
      regulation of Type 1 T cell-mediated immune responses in the guinea pig.

TI  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis MymA is a TLR2 agonist that activate macrophages and a 
      T(H)1 response.

AB  - Cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) is a major source of immunogenic 
      proteins that can be tested as vaccine candidates. MymA (Rv3083), a 55 kDa M.tb 
      flavin containing monooxygenase, is involved in modification of mycolic acids during 
      acidic shock following M.tb internalization in macrophage. In this study, we have 
      investigated the role of this cell wall associated protein in activation of 
      macrophages by toll like receptor (TLRs) engagement and subsequent signaling. Our 
      results showed that MymA stimulation of THP1 cells and human monocyte derived 
      macrophages (MDM) lead to upregulation of TLR2 and co-stimulatory molecules CD40, 
      CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR. This upregulation is partially reduced by TLR2 blocking 
      antibodies. The activation of macrophage following MymA stimulation also resulted in 
      release of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-12. Moreover, MymA also polarized 
      the immune response towards T(H)1 as shown by an increased IFN-γ level in the 
      supernatant of stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In consensus 
      with the TLR2 signaling involving MyD88 and NF-κB, we also observed several fold 
      increase in mRNA for TLR2, MyD88 and NF-κB on MymA induction of THP-1 and MDM by 
      qRT-PCR. The increased production of NF-κB following recognition of MymA by TLR2 was 
      further confirmed by HEK-TLR2 reporter cell line colorimetric assay. In conclusion, 
      immunological evaluation revealed that MymA is a TLR2 agonist that upregulates 
      signaling via MyD88 and NF-κB in macrophages to stimulate the release of 
      proinflammatory cytokines. The MymA protein should be investigated further for 
      expression in recombinant BCG as a pre-exposure vaccine or as a post-exposure 
      subunit vaccine candidate.

TI  - Application of different methods for the diagnosis of paratuberculosis in a dairy 
      cattle herd in Argentina.
PG  - 20-6
AB  - Paratuberculosis (Ptbc) has a high prevalence in Argentina, that affects dairy and 
      beef cattle. The culture is the gold standard to the diagnosis of the disease. 
      Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis), the aetiological 
      agent, is difficult to isolate and grow in culture. In this study, 24 randomly 
      selected cows of the Fresian breed from a dairy herd with a history of Ptbc were 
      used to evaluate the performance of different diagnostic techniques. These animals 
      did not show clinical signs of the disease. However, another animal from this herd 
      presented evidence of clinical disease at the moment of the present study. This 
      animal was necropsied and one strain of M. paratuberculosis was isolated from 
      faeces, lymph nodes and intestine. Serum for indirect absorbed enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) tests and whole 
      blood samples to perform gamma interferon (gammaIFN) release assays were obtained 
      from each animal. Faeces and milk samples to carry out bacteriological cultures, PCR 
      identification of M. paratuberculosis, and direct examinations of smears with 
      Ziehl-Neelsen's (ZN) stain were also collected. Tuberculin test with bovine purified 
      protein derivative (PPD) in the caudal fold was performed. The results showed that 
      10 out of 24 animals (41.6%) were positive to ELISA. Eight strains of M. 
      paratuberculosis were isolated, six from faeces, two from milk. Five of the animals 
      that excreted the bacteria through faeces were ELISA-positive, whereas the excreters 
      through milk were negative to ELISA. No positive samples by AGID were obtained in 
      clinical asymptomatic animals. Seven samples gave positive gammaIFN results with 
      avian PPD, but only two of these animals were confirmed with culture. Direct PCR, to 
      detect IS900 (M. paratuberculosis) in faeces and milk samples, was negative, but PCR 
      using material taken from faecal and milk cultures gave positive results before 
      visualizing the colonies. No sample was positive by PCR directed to IS6110 (M. 
      tuberculosis complex). There was not always agreement between isolations and ZN in 
      the studied samples. In conclusion, the absorbed ELISA was useful to detect positive 
      animals and excreters through faeces but not through milk. PCR applied to cultures 
      with incipient development before the visualization of colonies was effective to 
      specifically determine the presence of M. paratuberculosis. The gammaIFN test was 
      not able to detect the most positive animals confirmed by culture. The importance of 
      using ELISA and cultures is emphasized by this study but it is necessary to continue 
      with the gammaIFN test development for early detection of the disease.

TI  - BCG revaccination of health workers in Brazil to improve innate immune responses 
      against COVID-19: A structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 881
LID - 10.1186/s13063-020-04822-0 [doi]
LID - 881
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The BCG vaccine, widely used in Brazil in new-borns, induces adjuvant 
      protection for several diseases, including childhood virus infections. BCG activates 
      monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune 
      response. Therefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be 
      carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during 
      the pandemic. The hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and 
      prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity. The primary objective is to 
      verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce 
      incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection 
      in the city of Goiânia (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its 
      severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease. Secondary objectives are 
      to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate 
      immune response elicited to BCG. TRIAL DESIGN: This a phase II trial for 
      repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19. The trial is an 
      open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with 
      BCG and HW not vaccinated. PARTICIPANTS: The trial will recruit 800 HW of Goiânia - 
      Goiás, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning 
      and laboratorial evaluation. Eligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination 
      scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per 
      week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, 
      doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM 
      and IgG COVID-19 test. Participants with any of the following characteristics will 
      be excluded: - Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus 
      infection, including COVID-19; - Have had fever in the last fifteen days; - Have 
      been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion; - Have a history or confirmation 
      of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two 
      years or autoimmune diseases; - Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, 
      steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy; - Have less than 500 neutrophils per 
      mL of blood; - Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis; - Are breastfeeding 
      or pregnant; - Are younger than 18 years old; - Are participating as an investigator 
      in this clinical trial. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: HW will be randomized into the 
      BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group. The BCG vaccinated group 
      will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding 
      to approximately 2 x10(5) to 8 x10(5) CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG 
      Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT. LTD.). 
      The unvaccinated control group will not be vaccinated. The HW allocated in both 
      groups will be followed up at specific times points until 180 days post inclusion. 
      The vaccinated and control groups will be compared according to COVID-19 related 
      outcomes. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcomes are the incidence coefficient of 
      infection by SARS-CoV-2 determined by RT-PCR of naso-oropharyngeal swab specimen or 
      rapid lateral flow IgG and IgM test, and presence of general COVID-19 symptoms, 
      disease severity and admission to hospital during the 180 days of follow up. The 
      secondary outcome is the innate immune response elicited 15-20 days after 
      vaccination. RANDOMISATION: The vaccine vial contains approximately 10 doses. In 
      order to optimize the vaccine use, the randomisation was performed in blocks of 20 
      participants using the platform randomization.com [ 
      http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/permute.htm ]. The randomization was prepared 
      before any HW inclusion. The results were printed and inserted in sealed envelopes 
      that were numbered with BCG-001 to BCG-400. The printed results as well the 
      envelopes had the same numbers. At the time of the randomisation, each participant 
      that meets the inclusion criteria will receive a consecutive participant number 
      [BCG-001-BCG-400]. The sealed envelope with the assigned number, blinded to the 
      researchers, will be opened in front of the participant and the arm allocation will 
      be known. BLINDING (MASKING): There is no masking for the participants or for the 
      healthcare providers. The study will be blinded to the laboratory researchers and to 
      those who will be evaluating the outcomes and performing the statistical analyses. 
      In this case, only the participant identification number will be available. NUMBERS 
      TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Four hundred heath workers will be randomised in two 
      groups. Two hundred participants will be vaccinated, and 200 participants will not 
      be vaccinated. TRIAL STATUS: The protocol approved by the Brazilian Ethical 
      Committee is the seventh version, number CAAE: 31783720.0.0000.5078. The trial has 
      been recruiting since September 20(th), 2020. The clinical trial protocol was 
      registered on August 5(th), 2020. It is estimated that recruitment will finish by 
      March 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol number was registered on August 5(th), 
      2020 at REBEC (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos). Register number: RBR-4kjqtg 
      and WHO trial registration number UTN: U1111-1256-3892. FULL PROTOCOL: The full 
      protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website 
      (Additional file 1). In the interest in expediting dissemination of this material, 
      the familiar formatting has been eliminated; this Letter serves as a summary of the 
      key elements of the full protocol.

TI  - Mice transgenic for monocyte-tropic HIV type 1 produce infectious virus and display 
      plasma viremia: a new in vivo system for studying the postintegration phase of HIV 
      replication.
PG  - 481-92
AB  - To generate an in vivo system for investigating the postintegration phase of HIV-1 
      replication, mouse lines transgenic for a full-length infectious proviral clone of a 
      monocyte-tropic HIV-1 isolate, HIV-1JR-CSF, were constructed. Leukocytes from two 
      independent JR-CSF transgenic mouse lines produced HIV-1 that infected human PBMCs. 
      Plasma viremia was detected in these mice at levels (mean, >60,000 HIV RNA 
      copies/ml) comparable to those reported for HIV-1-infected individuals. The levels 
      of HIV RNA in these mice increased several-fold after either treatment with the 
      superantigen Staphylococcus enterotoxin B or infection with Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis. Thus, a provirus encoding a monocyte-tropic HIV-1 strain under the 
      control of its LTR expressed as a transgene in mice can proceed through the 
      postintegration replication phase and produce infectious virus. In addition, the 
      presence of plasma viremia that can be monitored by measuring plasma HIV-1 RNA 
      levels permits these mice to be used to study the impact of different interventions 
      on modulating in vivo HIV-1 production. Therefore, these mice provide a novel 
      manipulable system to investigate the in vivo regulation of HIV-1 production by 
      factors that activate the immune system. Furthermore, this murine system should be 
      useful in delineating the role of human-specific factors in modulating HIV-1 
      replication and investigating the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of agents that target 
      the postintegration stages of HIV-1 replication.

AB  - Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica (TO) is a rare disorder with unknown 
      aetiology. We report one case of TO in a patient with non-Hodgkin pulmonary lymphoma 
      and benign epidermal and trichylemmal cysts on the periorbital region and scalp. To 
      the authors' knowledge, the coincidence of these processes has never been described 
      before. The case was evaluated with conventional X-ray, computed tomography, 
      magnetic resonance imaging, fibre-optic bronchoscopy with 2 months interval, 
      histopathological evaluation, Tc-99 m MDP bone scintigraphy and microbiological 
      studies including PCR testing of bronchial biopsy and lavage specimens for 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Additionally, case reports of TO in the Turkish 
      literature are summarized.

TI  - Histological characteristics of the abdominal aortic wall in patients with vascular 
      chronic Q fever.
PG  - 282-9
LID - 10.1111/iep.12086 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to describe specific histological findings of the Coxiella 
      burnetii-infected aneurysmal abdominal aortic wall. Tissue samples of the aneurysmal 
      abdominal aortic wall from seven patients with chronic Q fever and 15 patients 
      without evidence of Q fever infection were analysed and compared. Chronic Q fever 
      was diagnosed using serology and tissue PCR analysis. Histological sections were 
      stained using haematoxylin and eosin staining, Elastica van Gieson staining and 
      immunohistochemical staining for macrophages (CD68), T lymphocytes (CD3), T 
      lymphocyte subsets (CD4 and CD8) and B lymphocytes (CD20). Samples were scored by 
      one pathologist, blinded for Q fever status, using a standard score form. Seven 
      tissue samples from patients with chronic Q fever and 15 tissue samples from 
      patients without Q fever were collected. Four of seven chronic Q fever samples 
      showed a necrotizing granulomatous response of the vascular wall, which was 
      characterized by necrotic core of the arteriosclerotic plaque (P = 0.005) and a 
      presence of high numbers of macrophages in the adventitia (P = 0.007) distributed in 
      typical palisading formation (P = 0.005) and surrounded by the presence of high 
      numbers of T lymphocytes located diffusely in media and adventitia. Necrotizing 
      granulomas are a histological finding in the C. burnetii-infected aneurysmal 
      abdominal aortic wall. Chronic Q fever should be included in the list of infectious 
      diseases with necrotizing granulomatous response, such as tuberculosis, cat scratch 
      disease and syphilis.

TI  - Diagnostic and prognostic value of serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 in non-small cell lung 
      carcinoma patients.
PG  - 1949-58
LID - 10.1007/s13277-015-3994-x [doi]
AB  - In response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), thioredoxin and DJ-1 are upregulated 
      to counteract the detrimental effect of ROS under normal condition. However, cancer 
      cells can take advantage of thioredoxin and DJ-1 against ROS-induced cell damage. In 
      several human cancer types, thioredoxin and DJ-1 were found to be overexpressed. The 
      present study aimed to explore the serum levels of thioredoxin and DJ-1 in non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and its relationship to the diagnosis and 
      prognosis of this particular malignancy. Sera from 134 NSCLC patients and 168 
      healthy controls were obtained. Using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
      method, the levels of serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 were measured and correlated to the 
      clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC patients. The diagnostic and prognostic 
      significance of the biomarkers were evaluated by using receiver operating curve 
      (ROC), Kaplan-Meier curve, and log-rank analyses and the Cox proportional hazard 
      model, respectively. Serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 levels were significantly higher in 
      the NSCLC patients than that in the controls (23.5 ± 6.57 vs. 13.8 ± 2.49 and 
      7.11 ± 2.02 vs. 5.18 ± 1.26, respectively). NSCLC patients at later stage cancer 
      showed significantly higher levels of serum thioredoxin and DJ-1 than those at the 
      early stages (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis showed that high serum thioredoxin level was an independent risk factor for 
      lymph nodal metastases and distant metastases (OR = 2.18, 95 % CI 1.26-3.41 and 
      OR = 3.68, 95 % CI 2.16-5.33, respectively). In addition, an increase in the serum 
      DJ-1 level was also identified as an independent risk factor for nodal metastases 
      (OR = 1.37, 95 % CI 1.11-3.04). For predicting the development of NSCLC, ROC/area 
      under the curve (AUC) analysis for thioredoxin indicated an AUC of 0.80 (sensitivity 
      0.62, specificity 0.92), and ROC/AUC analysis for DJ-1 showed an AUC of 0.78 
      (sensitivity 0.66, specificity 0.89). NSCLC patients with high serum thioredoxin and 
      DJ-1 levels had lower survival rates than those with low levels, and multivariate 
      analyses for overall survival revealed that high serum thioredoxin levels served as 
      an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC (HR = 2.07, 95 % CI 1.19-3.48). Serum 
      levels of thioredoxin and DJ-1 were significantly higher in NSCLC patients; 
      therefore, these may be utilized as novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for 
      NSCLC.

TI  - In-field evaluation of Xpert® HCV viral load Fingerstick assay in people who inject 
      drugs in Tanzania.
PG  - 514-521

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although novel hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA point-of-care technology has 
      the potential to enhance the diagnosis in resource-limited settings, very little 
      real-world validation of their utility exists. We evaluate the performance of HCV 
      RNA quantification using the Xpert(®) HCV viral load Fingerstick assay (Xpert(®) HCV 
      VL Fingerstick assay) as compared to the World Health Organisation pre-qualified 
      plasma Xpert(®) HCV VL assay among people who inject drugs (PWID) attending an 
      opioid agonist therapy (OAT) clinic in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. METHODS: Between 
      December 2018 and February 2019, consecutive HCV seropositive PWID attending the OAT 
      clinic provided paired venous and Fingerstick samples for HCV RNA quantification. 
      These were processed onsite using the GeneXpert(®) platform located at the Central 
      tuberculosis reference laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 208 out of 220 
      anti-HCV-positive participants recruited (94.5%) had a valid Xpert(®) HCV VL result 
      available; 126 (61%; 95% CI 53.8-67.0) had detectable and quantifiable HCV RNA. 
      About 188 (85%) participants had paired plasma and Fingerstick whole blood samples; 
      the sensitivity and specificity for the quantification of HCV RNA levels were 99.1% 
      and 98.7% respectively. There was an excellent correlation (R(2)  = .95) and 
      concordance (mean difference 0.13 IU/mL, (95% CI -0.9 to 0.16 IU/mL) in HCV RNA 
      levels between plasma samples and Fingerstick samples. CONCLUSION: This study found 
      excellent performance of the Xpert(®) HCV VL Fingerstick assay for HCV RNA detection 
      and quantification in an African-field setting. Its clinical utility represents an 
      important watershed in overcoming existing challenges to HCV diagnosis, which should 
      play a crucial role in HCV elimination in Africa.

TI  - [Investigation of West Nile virus in central nervous system infections of unknown 
      etiology in Ankara, Turkey].
PG  - 255-62
AB  - Arthropod-borne viral infections have recently gained considerable attention and 
      importance as re-emerging infections in a global scale. West Nile Virus (WNV), a 
      member of Flaviviridae, is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus that is usually 
      transmitted to humans by the bite of Culicine mosquitoes. Although the majority of 
      the human infections are asymptomatic, WNV may also cause febrile and neuro-invasive 
      diseases. Seroprevalence data from Turkey indicate that WNV activity is present in 
      Central Anatolia. In this study performed at Hacettepe University Hospital, paired 
      serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 87 adult patients with the 
      preliminary diagnosis of aseptic meningitis/encephalitis of unknown etiology were 
      evaluated retrospectively to identify WNV-related syndromes. Bacterial, fungal and 
      mycobacterial cultures yielded negative results and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 
      Herpes simplex virus nucleic acid tests were also negative for the selected 
      patients. Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)s and indirect 
      immunofluorescence test (IIFT)s were employed for WNV IgM and IgG antibody detection 
      (Anti-WNV Virus IgG/IgM ELISA, Anti-WNV Virus IgG/IgM IIFT; Euroimmun, Germany). 
      Additional ELISA/IIFT assays were further performed for WNV antibody reactive 
      samples to identify cross-reactions and/or infections with other flaviviruses and 
      phleboviruses. All WNV antibody positive samples were also evaluated by a WNV 
      real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. WNV IgM 
      and IgG antibodies were detected in %9.2 (8/87) and 3.4% (3/87) of the serum 
      samples, respectively. All IgG reactive samples were negative for IgM. All sera with 
      WNV antibody reactivity (n = 11) and the corresponding CSF samples were negative for 
      viral RNA via RT-PCR. In 5 of the 8 WNV IgM positive subjects, sandfly fever virus 
      IgM antibodies were detected, which was also accompanied by Dengue virus IgM 
      positivity in one sample. In another case, intrathecal antibody synthesis against 
      measles virus was demonstrated. Two cases (2/87; 2.3%) with WNV IgM positivity as 
      the only serologic marker were identified as probable WNV infections and clinical 
      features were discussed. In conclusion, in order to fully understand the impact of 
      WNV and/or other flavivirus infections in Turkey, epidemiology and ecological 
      features of these agents need to established.

AB  - IL-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) deficiency is a rare inherited immunodeficiency 
      disease characterized by homozygous mutations in the ITK gene and the inability to 
      control Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection leading to EBV-associated 
      lymphoproliferative disorders of B cell origin. Many aspects of its clinical 
      presentation and immunologic phenotype are still unclear to clinicians. We report on 
      a 14-year-old female patient with complaints of an 8-month history of cough and 
      fever. Imaging studies revealed diffuse pulmonary nodules and mediastinal 
      lymphadenopathy. Transbronchial lung biopsy showed nonmalignant polyclonal B cell 
      proliferation. High titers of EBV DNA were detected by PCR analysis in 
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, bone marrow, and blood. Genomic analysis revealed a 
      homozygous single base pair deletion in exon 5 of the ITK gene (c.468delT) in this 
      patient. Treatment with rituximab (anti-CD20 mab) resulted in complete clinical 
      remission with resolution of pulmonary lesions and a negative EBV titer in serum. 
      All patients with EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders should be analyzed 
      for mutations in ITK.

TI  - [A survey of children with HIV/AIDS in highly epidemic villages of AIDS].
PG  - 586-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence of HIV/AIDS among children and the transmission 
      routes in a highly endemic villages of AIDS. METHODS: Totally 208 high-risk women of 
      child bearing age and 159 of their children aged 0 - 14 years were investigated. 
      Their medical histories of blood donation or transfusion were collected, blood 
      samples were taken and sera were separated for HIV test. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) and Western blot assay were performed for HIV antibody. The 
      Nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay amplifying gag gene p17 was performed 
      on samples of children aged less than 18 months. RESULTS: Thirty-seven HIV infected 
      cases were found among 159 children aged 0 - 14 years of whom 33 were infected by 
      mother-to-child transmission (89.2%, 33/37), 3 by blood transfusion (8.1%, 3/37) and 
      one by iatrogenic route (2.7%, 1/37). Sixty seven mothers who were seropositive for 
      HIV and their 86 children who were born after 1992 were investigated, 33 cases of 
      them were infected with HIV. The rate of vertical transmission was 38.4% (33/86). 
      The HIV vertical transmission rate among mothers with AIDS (68.8%, 22/32) was 
      significantly greater than that among mothers with asymptomatic HIV infection 
      (20.4%, 11/54, P < 0.05). The number of children infected with HIV through vertical 
      transmission increased from 1993 to 2001. Among 37 children infected with HIV, 12 
      cases developed AIDS and 4 of them died, of whom 2 cases died from tuberculosis. The 
      morbidity of AIDS was 27.3% (9/33). Ninety three point nine percent (31/33) of 
      infected mothers didn't know their HIV seropositive status before pregnancy and 
      delivery. Of 8 pregnant women infected with HIV, one had aggravation of AIDS, 2 
      miscarried, 2 terminated their pregnancy and 3 continued their pregnancy. 
      CONCLUSION: Mother-to-child transmission of HIV was the major route of HIV/AIDS 
      transmission to the children. The main reason leading to HIV infection in children 
      was the lack of prenatal HIV counseling and testing for the high-risk women of 
      childbearing age and lake of interventions. The countermeasures must be taken to 
      control the further transmission of AIDS in order to protect the health of women and 
      children in the highly endemic areas of AIDS.

TI  - Clostridium difficile carriage and serum antitoxin responses in children with 
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - 2744-52
LID - 10.1097/01.MIB.0000435434.53871.36 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a high prevalence of 
      Clostridium difficile carriage, but little data exist regarding pediatric patients 
      with IBD. Serum antibody responses to C. difficile toxins in correlation with 
      organism carriage are not described in IBD. This study determines the prevalence of 
      C. difficile carriage and compares serum antibody responses to C. difficile toxins 
      in pediatric outpatients with IBD and controls. METHODS: Fecal and serum samples 
      were prospectively collected from pediatric outpatients with IBD (n = 85) and 
      age-matched controls (n = 78). Initial and follow-up stool samples were tested using 
      cytotoxigenic C. difficile culture and PCR to detect the toxin B gene. Pulsed-field 
      gel electrophoresis determined the strain type. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      determined serum immunoglobulin responses to C. difficile toxins. RESULTS: 
      Asymptomatic C. difficile carriage was significantly greater in IBD (17%) versus 
      controls (3%) (P = 0.012). IBD type, disease severity, IBD therapy, recent 
      antibiotics, and hospitalizations were not associated with carriage. Proton pump 
      inhibitor use was significantly higher in patients with C. difficile carriage (54% 
      versus 25%, P < 0.05). North American pulsed-field (NAP) strain carriage varied over 
      time in patients colonized with C. difficile. A significantly greater proportion of 
      patients with IBD had a positive serum antibody response to toxin A (69%) compared 
      with controls (53%) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic toxigenic C. difficile 
      carriage was increased in pediatric outpatients with IBD compared with controls. 
      Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with increased carriage. Antibody responses 
      to C. difficile toxins were increased in IBD, potentially promoting asymptomatic 
      colonization. Future studies should identify the risk factors for symptomatic C. 
      difficile in pediatric IBD.

      and a combinatory score based on a 3-gene host-signature has shown promise in 
      discriminating TB from other illnesses. We evaluated the accuracy of an 
      early-prototype cartridge-assay ("Xpert MTB Host Response", or 
      Xpert-MTB-HR-Prototype) of this 3-gene signature on bio-banked blood-samples from 
      PLHIV against a comprehensive microbiological reference standard (CMRS) and against 
      Xpert® MTB/RIF on first sputum alone. We depict results based on performance targets 
      set by WHO in comparison with a laboratory-based CRP assay. Of 201 patients 
      included, 67 were culture-positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis AUC for the 
      Xpert-MTB-HR-Prototype was 0·89 (CI 0·83-0·94) against the CMRS and 0·94 (CI 
      0·89-0·98) against Xpert MTB/RIF. Considering Xpert-MTB-HR-Prototype as a triage 
      test (at nearest upper value of sensitivity to 90%), specificity was 55·8% (CI 
      47·2-64·1) compared to the CMRS and 85·9% (CI 79·3-90·7) compared to Xpert MTB/RIF 
      as confirmatory tests. Considering Xpert-MTB-HR-Prototype as a stand-alone 
      diagnostic test, at a specificity near 95%, the test achieved a sensitivity of 65·7% 
      (CI 53·7-75·9) while CRP achieved a sensitivity of only 13·6% (CI 7·3-23·4). In this 
      first accuracy study of a prototype blood-based host-marker assay, we show the 
      possible value of the assay for triage and diagnosis in PLHIV.

AB  - Major challenges still exist in the accurate diagnosis of tuberculosis in children. 
      Algorithms based on clinical and radiological features remain in widespread use 
      despite poor performance. Newer molecular diagnostics allow for rapid identification 
      of TB and detection of drug-resistance in a subset of children, but lack 
      sensitivity. Molecular testing of multiple specimens, including non-traditional 
      specimen types, such as nasopharyngeal aspirates and stool and urine, may improve 
      sensitivity, but the optimal combination of specimens requires further research. 
      Novel tests under development or evaluation include a urine lipoarabinomannan test 
      with improved sensitivity and a range of biomarkers measured from stimulated or 
      unstimulated peripheral blood.

TI  - Cell-free DNA levels in plasma of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and 
      inflammatory lung disease.
PG  - 476-83

AB  - BACKGROUND: The analysis of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is expected to provide 
      useful biomarkers for early diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
      However, it remains unclear whether the intense release of cfDNA into the 
      bloodstream of NSCLC patients results from malignancy or chronic inflammatory 
      response. Consequently, the current diagnostic utility of plasma cfDNA 
      quantification has not been thoroughly validated in subjects with chronic 
      respiratory inflammation. Here we assess the effect of chronic respiratory 
      inflammation on plasma cfDNA levels and evaluate the potential clinical value of 
      this phenomenon as an early lung cancer diagnostic tool. METHODS: We measured plasma 
      cfDNA concentrations in 50 resectable NSCLC patients, 101 patients with chronic 
      respiratory inflammation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sarcoidosis, or 
      asthma) and 40 healthy volunteers using real-time PCR. RESULTS: We found 
      significantly higher plasma cfDNA levels in NSCLC patients than in subjects with 
      chronic respiratory inflammation and healthy individuals (P<0.0001). There were no 
      significant differences in plasma cfDNA levels between patients with chronic 
      respiratory inflammation and healthy volunteers. The cutoff point of >2.8 ng ml(-1) 
      provided 90% sensitivity and 80.5% specificity in discriminating NSCLC from healthy 
      individuals (area under the curve (AUC)=0.90). The receiver-operating 
      characteristics curve distinguishing NSCLC patients from subjects with chronic 
      respiratory inflammation indicated 56% sensitivity and 91% specificity at the 
      >5.25-ng ml(-1) cutoff (AUC=0.76). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that elevated plasma 
      cfDNA levels in NSCLC resulted primarily from tumour development rather than 
      inflammatory response, raising the potential clinical implications for lung cancer 
      screening and early diagnosis. Further research is necessary to better characterise 
      and identify factors and processes regulating cfDNA levels in the blood under normal 
      and pathological conditions.

AB  - Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has emerged as a serious health problem in 
      India. Although tuberculosis appears to be the commonest opportunistic infection, 
      studies pertaining to opportunistic viruses are scant In the present study co 
      infection with EBV was evaluated in patients with AIDS using a highly sensitive 
      polymerase chain reaction besides anti Zebra antibody assays for diagnosis of an 
      active EBV infection in 37 patients of full-blown AIDS and 32 healthy seropositives. 
      Thirty healthy laboratory workers were used as controls. Out of 37 patients with 
      AIDS, 12 were positive for anti Zebra antibodies and 23 were positive for EBV by the 
      PCR reaction. Out of the 32 seropositives, 3 were positive for anti Zebra antibodies 
      and 4 were positive by PCR assay. The difference between seropositives and AIDS was 
      significant (p < .05). None of the controls were positive for an active EBV 
      infection. It is concluded that active EBV infection is an important co infection in 
      patients with AIDS and may contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in 
      these patients.

TI  - Association of CD45(dim)VLA-4 (+) cells with the NKT cell lineage and their 
      selective expression of IL-13, IP-15, and CCR3 transcripts.
PG  - 183-91
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Estrogen (E2) was shown to prevent experimental autoimmune 
      encephalomyelitis (EAE) and to produce a novel population of regulatory 
      CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) cells. Although their appearance was dependent upon an elevated 
      hormonal level, E2 was not required for their production, as they also were induced 
      by immunization with Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a component of complete Freund's 
      adjuvant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molecular techniques, including ribonuclease 
      protection assays and quantitative RT-PCR, were used to provide further 
      characterization of CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) cells. Moreover, we determined the 
      developmental requirements of the CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) cells using genetically modified 
      mice and extensive flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: Characterization of 
      CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) mRNA profile revealed highly elevated levels of CD16, CD44, CCR3, 
      IP-15, and IL-13 transcripts compared with their CD45(high)VLA-4(+) counterparts. 
      Furthermore, we found up-regulation of anti-apoptotic bcl-w and bcl-xl genes and 
      transcripts encoding the TCRalpha and CD8alpha homodimer. The production of 
      CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) cells was evident in nude mice and in MHC class II- and 
      beta2-microglobulin, but not in CD1-deficient mice, suggesting a crucial role for 
      CD1 in their induction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) 
      cells might resemble natural killer T cells and imply possible roles for IL-13 and 
      IP-15 in the protective function of CD45(dim)VLA-4(+) cells. A better understanding 
      of how these cells, also occurring naturally during pregnancy, suppress the harmful 
      immune response of EAE may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to combat multiple 
      sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.

LID - 10.5588/ijtld.19.0239 [doi]
AB  - SETTING: Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation area, Maharashtra State, 
      India.OBJECTIVE: To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the Xpert(®) MTB/RIF 
      assay among adults with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and with or without 
      diabetes (DM).DESIGN: As part of a prospective cohort study, we screened 2359 adults 
      presumed to have PTB with no history of TB. All individuals underwent testing for 
      two sputum smears, culture, Xpert, glycated haemoglobin and fasting blood sugar. We 
      calculated sensitivity and specificity of Xpert by comparing it with TB sputum 
      culture result as a gold standard.RESULTS: Among screened individuals, 483 (20%) 
      were diagnosed with DM and 1153 (49%) with pre-DM; 723 (31%) had no DM. Overall 
      sensitivity of Xpert was 96% (95%CI 95-97) and specificity was 91% (95%CI 89-93). 
      Xpert sensitivity was significantly higher among DM group (98%) than in the 'No DM' 
      (95%; P < 0.01) and pre-DM (96%; P < 0.05) groups. Among sputum smear-negative 
      individuals, Xpert sensitivity was higher in the DM group than in the No DM (92% vs. 
      82%; P = 0.054) and pre-DM group (92% vs. 82%; P = 0.037).CONCLUSION: High 
      sensitivity and specificity of Xpert underscores the need for its rapid scale up for 
      the early detection of TB in settings with a high dual burden of TB and DM.

TI  - Urine PCR evaluation to diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis.
PG  - e9311
LID - 10.5812/jjm.9311 [doi]
LID - e9311
AB  - BACKGROUND: Culture and specific staining (including Zeil-Nelson and fluorescent 
      methods) are standard measures for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). These methods 
      are time-consuming and sometimes have a low level of accuracy. In addition, in some 
      cases obtaining samples for smear and culture involves invasive procedures; while in 
      other cases there is no suitable sample for evaluation. Therefore, there is a need 
      for faster and more accurate diagnostic methods. OBJECTIVES: The current study 
      investigated the diagnostic value of tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (TB-PCR) 
      of urine in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      This case-control study included; 77 proven pulmonary tuberculosis cases (according 
      to the national TB protocol), and 30 subjects who were completely healthy. The urine 
      samples (50 mL) were mixed with 0.5 mL Ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid. DNA 
      extraction and PCR testing were performed on all blood samples using SI 6110 
      primers. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was also cultivated in the sputum and urine 
      samples of the patients. RESULTS: Results of the current study indicated that 48 
      (62.3%) patients out of 77 had a positive sputum culture. Urine cultures and 
      acid-fast smears were negative. Urine PCR-TB was positive in 48.0% (37/77) of the 
      patients. The speciﬁc TBPCR complex was positive in 56.2% (27/48) of the positive 
      cultures and 34.4% (10/29) of the negative culture PTB patients. The control group 
      had negative urine PCR (sensitivity 56.2% and specificity 100%). CONCLUSIONS: With 
      regard to the ease of urine sample preparation and the 100% specificity the PCR 
      method, performing urine PCR could be used as a diagnostic aid in PTB cases 
      obtaining sputum samples is problematic.

TI  - Atypical Radiographic Presentation of Cryptococcus Pneumonia in a Newly Diagnosed 
      HIV Patient.
PG  - 9032958
LID - 10.1155/2019/9032958 [doi]
LID - 9032958
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus infection is an opportunistic infection that occurs 
      primarily among immunocompromised patients, and the morbidity and mortality of this 
      infection is high if left unrecognized and untreated. There are no clinical or 
      radiographic characteristics typical of cryptococcal pneumonia, and its clinical and 
      radiological presentations often overlap with other diagnoses. CASE PRESENTATION: We 
      present a case of a 25-year-old man from Ghana admitted for an altered mental state, 
      weight loss, neck pain, fever, and photophobia. He was diagnosed with Cryptococcus 
      neoformans meningitis by cerebrospinal fluid culture and with disseminated 
      cryptococcal infection by a positive Cryptococcus blood test. Diffuse micronodular 
      opacities were found in a miliary pattern in the upper portions of both lungs upon 
      imaging, which suggested miliary tuberculosis; thus, the patient was started on 
      antituberculosis therapy. The patient underwent flexible fiber optic bronchoscopy, 
      and transbronchial biopsy of the right lung showed bronchopneumonia with fungal 
      spores consistent with filamentous Cryptococcus neoformans, which grew in tissue 
      culture of the right lung. Interferon-gamma release assay, Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis PCR, and acid-fast bacilli staining of the bronchoalveolar lavage were 
      negative for the M. tuberculosis complex. CONCLUSION: The similarities in clinical 
      and imaging findings among patients with acute immunodeficiency syndrome with 
      coinfections make diagnoses difficult; thus image-guided biopsies are essential to 
      confirm diagnoses.

TI  - CD8+CD45RA+CD27-CD28-T-cell subset in PBL of cervical cancer patients representing 
      CD8+T-cells being able to recognize cervical cancer associated antigens provided by 
      HPV 16 E7.
PG  - 406-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In response to antigenic stimulation, naive MHC-class I restricted and 
      antigen-specific CD8+CD45RA+CD28+T-cells undergo clonal expansion and differentiate 
      into CD8+CD45RO+ memory T-cells. Upon re- encounter with the nominal antigen, 
      CD45RO+ T-cells are able to convert to CD8+CD45RA+CD28-T-cells displaying potent 
      immune effector functions, including TNF-alpha production. This T-cell subpopulation 
      constitutes a minor population in healthy individuals. In the present study we are 
      currently evaluating whether this particular T-cell subset in PBL represents 
      CD8+T-cells which may be able to recognize cervical cancer associated antigens 
      provided by HPV 16 E7. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Flow-cytometric cell sorted 
      CD8+CD45RA+CD28- and CD8+CD45RA+CD28-T-cells were obtained from patients with 
      cervical cancer and tested for recognition of HLA-A2 restricted peptides derived 
      from the human papillomavirus (HPV)16-E7 gene product using ELISA. HPV DNA in tumor 
      tissue was detected by PCR. RESULTS: We show that the effector 
      CD8+CD45RA+CD28-T-cell subset is expanded in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 
      patients with cervical cancer, but also in PBL from patients with an acute 
      mycobacterial infection. CD8+T-cells from 3/6 cancer patients showed a 
      peptide-specific immune response which could be segregated in peptide epitopes which 
      elicited either a strong TNF-alpha production, or GM-CSF and IL-2 secretion. 
      Peptide-reactivity could exclusively be detected in the ex vivo freshly isolated 
      CD8+CD45RA+CD28-T-cell population. A similar situation was found to be true for 
      HLA-A2 presented peptide epitopes derived from M. tuberculosis-associated antigens 
      presented to T-cells obtained from patients with tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      sorting of CD8+CD45RA+CD28-T-cells enables to determine the fine specificity of CD8+ 
      effector T-cells without the need for in vitro manipulation and aids to define the 
      most appropriate target epitopes for novel vaccine designs.

AB  - We previously reported the in vitro cellular immune responses to recombinant 
      antigens (rAgs) of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Here we report 
      the differential immune responses and protective efficacy of four rAgs of MAP (85A, 
      85B, 85C, and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) used with two adjuvants (monophosphoryl 
      lipid A (MPLA) containing synthetic trehalose dicorynomycolate, cell wall skeleton 
      (MPLA) and bovine IL-12), against MAP challenge in calves. Group I was administered 
      the four rAgs with MPLA and IL-12. Group II was administered the four rAgs and MPLA. 
      Group III received MPLA and IL-12, and Group IV MPLA. rAgs induced significant 
      lymphoproliferative responses in vaccinated animals (Groups I and II). All the rAgs 
      induced significant IFN-gamma production from 11 to 23 wk after primary vaccination 
      (APV), except for SOD. Significant increases were noted in CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), 
      CD21(+), CD25(+), and gammadelta(+) cells against all four rAgs in vaccinated 
      animals. rAg-specific expression of IL-2, IL-12p40, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was 
      significantly higher in the two vaccinated groups. Culture results found 4/8 animals 
      in Group I, 3/8 animals in Group II, and 3/4 animals in Groups III and IV were 
      positive for MAP in one or more tissues. Among the seven positive animals in Groups 
      I and II, all but one had had <10CFU. Isolation was confined to one tissue in these 
      animals, except in one animal in which MAP was isolated from two tissues. In the 
      control groups (III and IV), MAP was cultured from up to five different tissues with 
      >250CFU. Preliminary data from this study indicates that all four rAgs induced a 
      good Th1 response and conferred protection against MAP infection in calves.

AB  - The H5 gene of avian influenza virus (AIV) strain A/chicken/Malaysia/5744/2004(H5N1) 
      was cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector, and Esat-6 gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was 
      fused into downstream of the H5 gene as a genetic adjuvant for DNA vaccine 
      candidates. The antibody level against AIV was measured using enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. Sera 
      obtained from specific-pathogen-free chickens immunized with pcDNA3.1/H5 and 
      pcDNA3.1/H5/Esat-6 demonstrated antibody responses as early as 2 weeks after the 
      first immunization. Furthermore, the overall HI antibody titer in chickens immunized 
      with pcDNA3.1/H5/Esat-6 was higher compared to the chickens immunized with 
      pcDNA3.1/H5 (p<0.05). The results suggested that Esat-6 gene of M. tuberculosis is a 
      potential genetic adjuvant for the development of effective H5 DNA vaccine in 
      chickens.

AB  - The cardiac natriuretic peptides atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and brain 
      natriuretic peptide (BNP) are discoordinately regulated in myocardial inflammation 
      associated with acute allograft rejection in humans and during in vitro exposure of 
      cardiocyte cultures to some proinflammatory cytokines. We used experimental 
      autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) to determine whether the discoordinate regulation of 
      ANF and BNP was specific to the situations above or was generally associated with 
      other types of myocardial inflammation. The dependency of this process to 
      angiotensin signaling was also determined, given that previous work demonstrated 
      beneficial effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker olmesartan in myocarditis. 
      Histopathological changes, plasma and cardiac ANF, BNP, and selected cytokines gene 
      expression as well as plasma cytokine levels using a cytokine array were determined 
      in EAM, angiotensin receptor blocker-treated, and control rats. It was found that 
      EAM specifically increases BNP but not ANF circulating levels, thus mimicking the 
      findings in acute cardiac allograft rejection and the effect of some proinflammatory 
      cytokines on cardiocyte cultures in vitro. Plasma cytokine array and real-time PCR 
      revealed that lipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine, monocyte chemotactic 
      protein-1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 were increased in plasma and 
      in the myocardium of EAM rats. Olmesartan treatment reversed virtually all 
      neuroendocrine and histopathological cardiac changes induced by EAM, thus providing 
      a mechanistic insight into this phenomenon. It is concluded that the inflammatory 
      process contributes specific cytokines, leading to the disregulation of cardiac ANF 
      and BNP production observed during myocardial inflammation, and that this process is 
      angiotensin receptor 1 dependent.

AB  - Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium 
      bovis. During early-stage infection, M. bovis-infected cattle shed mycobacteria 
      through nasal secretions, which can be detected via nested-polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) experiments. Little research has focused on immune responses in nested 
      PCR-positive (bTB PCR-P) or nested PCR-negative (bTB PCR-N) M. bovis-infected 
      cattle. Here, we investigated the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs), with or without stimulation by purified protein derivative of bovine 
      tuberculin (PPD-B), among bTB PCR-P, bTB PCR-N, and healthy cattle using RNA-Seq. We 
      also explored the potential value of PBMC transcripts as novel biomarkers for 
      diagnosing bTB. Numerous differentially expressed genes were identified following 
      pair-wise comparison of different groups, with or without PPD-B stimulation 
      (adjusted p < 0.05). Compared with healthy cattle, bTB PCR-P, and bTB PCR-N cattle 
      shared 5 significantly dysregulated biological pathways, including Cytokine-cytokine 
      receptor interaction, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, Hematopoietic cell lineage, 
      Osteoclast differentiation and HTLV-I infection. Notably, dysregulated biological 
      pathways of bTB PCR-P and bTB PCR-N cattle were associated with cell death and 
      phagocytosis, respectively. Lymphotoxin alpha and interleukin-8 could potentially 
      differentiate M. bovis-infected and healthy cattle upon stimulation with PPD-B, with 
      area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of 0.9991 and 0.9343, respectively. B cell 
      lymphoma 2 and chitinase 3-like 1 might enable differentiation between bTB PCR-P and 
      bTB PCR-N upon stimulation with PPD-B, with AUC values of 0.9100 and 0.8893, 
      respectively. Thus, the PBMC transcriptome revealed the immune responses in M. 
      bovis-infected cattle (bTB PCR-P and bTB PCR-N) and may provide a novel sight in bTB 
      diagnosis.

TI  - Long Noncoding RNA and Predictive Model To Improve Diagnosis of Clinically Diagnosed 
      Pulmonary Tuberculosis.
LID - 10.1128/JCM.01973-19 [doi]
LID - e01973-19
AB  - Clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients lack microbiological 
      evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis often 
      occurs as a consequence. We investigated the potential of long noncoding RNAs 
      (lncRNAs) and corresponding predictive models to diagnose these patients. We 
      enrolled 1,764 subjects, including clinically diagnosed PTB patients, 
      microbiologically confirmed PTB cases, non-TB disease controls, and healthy 
      controls, in three cohorts (screening, selection, and validation). Candidate lncRNAs 
      differentially expressed in blood samples of the PTB and healthy control groups were 
      identified by microarray and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in the 
      screening cohort. Logistic regression models were developed using lncRNAs and/or 
      electronic health records (EHRs) from clinically diagnosed PTB patients and non-TB 
      disease controls in the selection cohort. These models were evaluated by area under 
      the concentration-time curve (AUC) and decision curve analyses, and the optimal 
      model was presented as a Web-based nomogram, which was evaluated in the validation 
      cohort. Three differentially expressed lncRNAs (ENST00000497872, n333737, and 
      n335265) were identified. The optimal model (i.e., nomogram) incorporated these 
      three lncRNAs and six EHRs (age, hemoglobin, weight loss, low-grade fever, 
      calcification detected by computed tomography [CT calcification], and interferon 
      gamma release assay for tuberculosis [TB-IGRA]). The nomogram showed an AUC of 0.89, 
      a sensitivity of 0.86, and a specificity of 0.82 in differentiating clinically 
      diagnosed PTB cases from non-TB disease controls of the validation cohort, which 
      demonstrated better discrimination and clinical net benefit than the EHR model. The 
      nomogram also had a discriminative power (AUC, 0.90; sensitivity, 0.85; specificity, 
      0.81) in identifying microbiologically confirmed PTB patients. lncRNAs and the 
      user-friendly nomogram could facilitate the early identification of PTB cases among 
      suspected patients with negative M. tuberculosis microbiological evidence.

AB  - We present a case of tuberculosis-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in a 
      14-year-old girl. The patient presented with weight loss, malaise, fatigue, 
      prolonged fever, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Laboratory investigation revealed 
      pancytopenia (white blood cells, 2,020 cells/µL; hemoglobin, 10.2 g/dL; platelets, 
      52,000 cells/µL), hypertriglyceridemia (229 mg/dL), and hyperferritinemia (1,420 
      ng/mL). Bone marrow biopsy showed a hypocellular bone marrow with a large numbers of 
      histiocytes and marked hemophagocytosis; based on these findings, she was diagnosed 
      with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with both 
      the bone marrow aspiration and sputum samples revealed the presence of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis. Antitubercular therapy with immune modulation therapy including 
      dexamethasone and intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated. The results of all 
      laboratory tests including bone marrow biopsy and PCR with both the bone marrow 
      aspiration and sputum samples were normalized after treatment. Thus, early bone 
      marrow biopsy and the use of techniques such as PCR can avoid delays in diagnosis 
      and improve the survival rates of patients with tuberculosis-associated 
      hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct a strain of recombinant Mycobacterium smegmatis expressing 
      the heat shock protein 65 (Hsp65) and human interleukin 2 (IL-2) fusion protein 
      (rMS-Hsp65/IL-2) and to explore the effect of this construct on lymphocyte function 
      in mice. METHODS: The fusion gene encoding Hsp65-hIL-2 was cloned into shuttle 
      vector pSMT3. The recombinant plasmid pSMT3-Hsp65-hIL-2 was transferred to 
      Mycobacterium smegmatis by electroporation. Positive clones were selected by 
      hygromycin and identified by PCR. The expression of fusion protein Hsp65-hIL-2 was 
      verified using indirect immunofluorescence staining. Mice were immunized for two 
      times by subcutaneously injection with 1×10(6) CFU rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 at a three-week 
      interval. Two weeks after the second immunization, mice were sacrificed and the 
      serum samples were collected for determination of anti-Hsp65 specific IgG. Splenic 
      lymphocytes were isolated and treated with the rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 to determine 
      lymphocytic proliferation activity by MTT assay. IFN-γ- and IL-2 in the medium of 
      the treated cells were also determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Successful construction of 
      rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 was verified by PCR and immunofluorescence staining. Compared to the 
      splenic lymphocytes isolated from mice immunized with Bacille Calmette-Guerin or 
      mice immunized with Mycobacterium smegmatis alone, the splenic lymphocytes isolated 
      from mice immunized with rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 showed a marked increase in the 
      proliferation of lymphocytes, together with an increased production of important 
      cytokines such as IFN-γ-and IL-2. CONCLUSIONS: rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 markedly enhances 
      lymphocyte function. Therefore, the fusion protein generated by rMS-Hsp65/IL-2 may 
      be of potential value in generating an effective vaccine against tuberculosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Enterococcus faecalis is an emerging nosocomial pathogen. The study 
      investigates the E. faecalis specific innate immune cells interplay between Natural 
      Killer cells (NK) and Dendritic cells (DCs) in vitro. The present study also 
      determines the prevalence, phenotype, and genotype of Enterococcus faecalis isolated 
      from paediatric patients with urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      total of 14 clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp were characterized using standard 
      phenotypic tests and virulence factors were determined by polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR). Immature monocyte-derived DCs were cultured in the presence of six pathogenic 
      E. faecalis isolates infected DCs were co-cultured with NK cells. Bacteria induced 
      matured DCs and activated NK cells were evaluated by polychromatic flow cytometry. 
      RESULTS: Out of 14 isolates, 13 were identified as E. faecalis. E. faecalis infected 
      DCs differentiated into inflammatory and CD141 + DCs that promote NK cell 
      activation. Activated NK cells significantly elevated the secretion of cytokines and 
      chemokines in infected DCs during E. faecalis. This suggests that DC induced NK cell 
      activation is effectively enhanced by the presence of E. faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Studies on virulence determinants are necessary to understand the pathogenesis of E. 
      faecalis. DC/NK cross-talk is of particular importance at mucosal surfaces such as 
      the intestine, urinary tract where the immune system exists in intimate association 
      with commensal bacteria. We found E. faecalis specific NK cells activation by 
      infected DC-derived effector signals may involve in the killing of transformed or 
      infected cells, thus coordinating innate and adaptive immune responses. E. faecalis 
      specific DC/NK interaction is necessary for DC maturation and modulation of innate 
      effector functions. Similarly, activated NK cells that induce- maturation of DC by 
      pattern recognition receptors are also required for the generation of bacterial 
      specific adaptive immunity.

TI  - Cocktail treatment of antibiotic, steroid, and analgesic in a tubercular case; the 
      urgency to set up antimicrobial stewardship practices in the community.
PG  - 1789-1791
LID - 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_4_19 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis is a well-known entity in India with many implemented policies to 
      ensure the cost-effective early management. Missed, delayed, and complicated 
      presentations do occur, requiring expensive tertiary level of health care. Among 
      many contributing factors, lack of antibiotic stewardship is at the top. We report a 
      case of 65-year-old man who presented with on and off fever for six months, 
      receiving cocktail treatments of antibiotics, analgesics, and steroids from a local 
      dispensary. Our initial investigations revealed microcytic anemia with high 
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocytosis, and bilateral pleural effusion on 
      chest X-ray. Contrast enhanced computer tomography of chest and abdomen suggested 
      disseminated tuberculosis including bilateral empyema. Frank pus was drained on 
      thoracocentesis, which was negative for Gram stain, Ziehl-Neelsen stain, and 
      bacterial culture, but positive CB-NAAT for tubercular bacilli with no resistance to 
      rifampicin. Mantoux test and stool occult blood were positive. This case highlights 
      an unusual presentation of tuberculosis and the ongoing lacunae in the society with 
      importance to the primary care providers in the effective management of tuberculosis 
      focusing on antimicrobial stewardship.

      Myanmar.
PG  - 1395657
LID - 10.1080/16549716.2017.1395657 [doi]
LID - 1395657
AB  - BACKGROUND: A previous review of early infant diagnosis (EID) using polymerase chain 
      reaction technology (PCR) under integrated HIV care (IHC) program in Myanmar 
      revealed a low uptake of timely (within 6 to 8 weeks of babies' age) EID and a long 
      turnaround time (TAT) of receiving results. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine 
      the proportion and factors associated with the composite outcome of a long TAT 
      (≥7 weeks; from sample collection to receipt of result by mother) or nonreceipt of 
      result among HIV-exposed babies whose blood samples were collected for PCR at 
      <9 months of age under the IHC program, Myanmar (2013-15). METHODS: Cohort study 
      involving record review of routinely collected data. A predictive Poisson regression 
      model with robust variance estimates was fitted for risk factors of long TAT or 
      nonreceipt of result. RESULTS: Blood samples of 1 000 babies were collected; among 
      them, long TAT or nonreceipt of results was seen in 690 (69%), and this was more 
      than 50% across all subgroups. Babies with a mother's CD4 count of 100-350 
      cells/mm(3) at enrollment [adjusted RR (0.95 confidence intervals, CI): 0.8 (0.7, 
      0.9)] had a 20% lower risk of long TAT or nonreceipt of results when compared with 
      ≥350 cells/mm(3). Distance between ART center and PCR facility ≥105 km [adjusted RR 
      (0.95 CI): 1.2 (1.1, 1.4)], when compared with <105 km, was associated with 20% 
      higher risk of long TAT or nonreceipt of results. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of 
      babies with long TAT or nonreceipt of result by the mother was high. Point-of-care 
      testing for EID may reduce TAT/nonreceipt of results by the mother. Health system, 
      laboratory, and logistic factors such as sample transportation, laboratory 
      procedures, and result dispatching associated with long TAT should be further 
      explored.

TI  - Comparison of serum PCR assay and histopathology for the diagnosis of invasive 
      aspergillosis and mucormycosis in immunocompromised patients with sinus involvement.
PG  - 46-48
LID - 10.18869/acadpub.cmm.2.4.46 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Invasive fungal infections cause morbidity and mortality in 
      patients with hematologic malignancies and immunosuppression. Although these 
      infections are commonly caused by Candida and Aspergillus species, infections caused 
      by Mucoralean fungi are also on a growing trend. The definitive diagnosis of 
      mucormycosis includes visualization of non-septate hyphae on pathology or growth of 
      Mucoralean fungi culture. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to diagnose 
      mucormycosis from paraffin blocks; however, it yields discrepant results in 
      diagnosis of mucormycosis from blood samples. In the current study, we sought to 
      examine the efficiency of PCR test for the diagnosis of mucormycosis and 
      aspergillosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with suspected fungal 
      sinus infection were recruited from the Hematology-Oncology unit in Taleghani 
      Hospital, Tehran, Iran. DNA was extracted and semi-nested PCR was performed. 
      RESULTS: PCR was reported negative for all the 31 serum samples. Our assay had a 
      sensitivity of 1.3 ng and 12 pg for Mucoralean and Aspergillus species, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Using serum PCR, we detected Aspergillus and Mucoralean 
      species in patients with suspected fungal sinus infection. While this test may have 
      utility in diagnosis directly from biopsy site, it appears unreliable for use as a 
      noninvasive blood test.

TI  - [Preparation antibodies against recombinant bovine IFN-gamma and development of 
      sandwich ELISA for bovine IFN-gamma detection].
PG  - 40-5
AB  - This study was aimed to establish ELISA for recombinant bovine IFN-gamma 
      (BovIFN-gamma) detection and provide a new method for diagnosis of pathogenic 
      infection. The total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood leucocytes cultured with 
      PHA mitogen stimulation. Then bovine IFN-gamma (BovIFN-gamma) gene cDNA was 
      amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pET28a to obtain the expression plasmid 
      designated as pETBovIFN-gamma. The pETBovlFN-gamma was further transformed into 
      competent E. coli BL21 cells and a 18kD His-tagged protein as expected was expressed 
      after IPTG induction. By using purified recombinant BovIFN-gamma as antigen and 
      lymphocyte-hybridoma technique, four hybridoma cell lines which stably secreted 
      monoclonal antibodies against rBovIFN-gamma were generated, designated as A7, A10, 
      G6, and G10. The immunoglobin subset was identified as IgG1 . Western-blotting 
      analysis and ELISA demonstrated that the monoclonal antibodies secreted by all the 
      four hybridoma cell lines could react specifically to the recombinant BovIFN-gamma, 
      but not irrelative proteins such as Ag85B, ESAT-6-CFP-10 and GM-CSF, suggesting that 
      the four hybridoma cell lines were rBovIFN-gamma specific monoclonal antibodies. A 
      sandwich ELISA was established by using A10 secreted monoclonal antibody and rabbit 
      polyclonal antibodies against BovIFN-gamma, HRP labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. The 
      results indicated that the sensitivity was 2ng/mL. This sandwich ELISA to detect 
      BovIFN-gamma paved the way to develop a sensitive method for specific infection 
      detection such as bovine tuberculosis diagnosis.

      Using Sputum Multiplex Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction.

LID - 10.1093/cid/ciz332 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the etiology of respiratory infections in 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients in resource-limited settings. 
      METHODS: We performed quantitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) for Pneumocystis jirovecii and common bacterial and viral respiratory 
      pathogens on sputum samples (spontaneous or induced) from a prospective cohort study 
      of HIV-infected inpatients with World Health Organization danger signs and cough. 
      Mycobacterial culture was done on 2 sputum samples, blood cultures, and relevant 
      extrapulmonary samples. RESULTS: We enrolled 284 participants from 2 secondary-level 
      hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa: median CD4 count was 97 cells/μL, 64% were 
      women, and 38% were on antiretroviral therapy. One hundred forty-eight had 
      culture-positive tuberculosis, 100 had community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), 26 had P. 
      jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), and 64 had other diagnoses. Probable bacterial infection 
      (>105 copies/mL) was detected in 133 participants; the prevalence was highest in 
      those with CAP (52%). Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the 
      commonest bacterial pathogens detected; atypical bacteria were uncommon. Viruses 
      were detected in 203 participants; the prevalence was highest in those with PJP 
      (85%). Human metapneumovirus was the commonest virus detected. Multiple coinfections 
      were commonly detected. CONCLUSIONS: Sputum multiplex PCR could become a useful 
      diagnostic tool for bacterial respiratory infections in HIV-infected inpatients, but 
      its value is limited as quantitative cutoffs have only been established for a few 
      bacterial pathogens and validation has not been done in this patient population. We 
      found a high prevalence of respiratory viruses, but it is unclear whether these 
      viruses were causing infection as there are no accepted quantitative PCR cutoffs for 
      diagnosing respiratory viral infections.

TI  - Comparison of enzyme immunoassays for antibodies to Haemophilus ducreyi in a 
      community outbreak of chancroid in the United States.
PG  - 1390-5
AB  - The performance of two EIAs (adsorption EIA and lipooligosaccharide [LOS] EIA) that 
      detect antibodies to Haemophilus ducreyi was evaluated with serum specimens obtained 
      from 163 patients (96 with genital ulcer disease [GUD]). Paired serum specimens 
      (initial and follow-up) were obtained from 52 of the GUD patients. By use of initial 
      serum specimens from 82 GUD patients whose etiologic agents for their ulcers had 
      been identified, the adsorption EIA had a sensitivity and specificity for chancroid 
      of 53% and 71%, while the LOS EIA had a sensitivity and specificity of 48% and 89%, 
      respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of the adsorption EIA increased to 78% and 
      84%, respectively, when the results of follow-up serum specimens were used to 
      calculate optimal performance. The proportion of patients testing positive for H. 
      ducreyi who had anti-H. ducreyi IgG antibodies, as determined by adsorption EIA, 
      increased with the duration of infection, thus limiting the role of EIAs in the 
      diagnosis of chancroid.

TI  - Symptomatic Cryptococcal Antigenemia Presenting as Early Cryptococcal Meningitis 
      With Negative Cerebral Spinal Fluid Analysis.
PG  - 2094-2098
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciy817 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals with cryptococcal antigenemia are at high risk of developing 
      cryptococcal meningitis if untreated. The progression and timing from asymptomatic 
      infection to cryptococcal meningitis is unclear. We describe a subpopulation of 
      individuals with neurologic symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia but negative 
      cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) studies. METHODS: We evaluated 1201 human 
      immunodeficiency virus-seropositive individuals hospitalized with suspected 
      meningitis in Kampala and Mbarara, Uganda. Baseline characteristics and clinical 
      outcomes of participants with neurologic-symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia and 
      negative CSF cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) were compared to participants with 
      confirmed CSF CrAg+ cryptococcal meningitis. Additional CSF testing included 
      microscopy, fungal culture, bacterial culture, tuberculosis culture, multiplex 
      FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Biofire), and Xpert MTB/Rif. RESULTS: We 
      found 56% (671/1201) of participants had confirmed CSF CrAg+ cryptococcal meningitis 
      and 4% (54/1201) had neurologic symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia with negative 
      CSF CrAg. Of those with negative CSF CrAg, 9% (5/54) had Cryptococcus isolated on 
      CSF culture (n = 3) or PCR (n = 2) and 11% (6/54) had confirmed tuberculous 
      meningitis. CSF CrAg-negative patients had lower proportions with CSF pleocytosis 
      (16% vs 26% with ≥5 white cells/μL) and CSF opening pressure >200 mmH2O (16% vs 71%) 
      compared with CSF CrAg-positive patients. No cases of bacterial or viral meningitis 
      were detected by CSF PCR or culture. In-hospital mortality was similar between 
      symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia (32%) and cryptococcal meningitis (31%; P = 
      .91). CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal antigenemia with meningitis symptoms was the third 
      most common meningitis etiology. We postulate this is early cryptococcal 
      meningoencephalitis. Fluconazole monotherapy was suboptimal despite 
      Cryptococcus-negative CSF. Further studies are warranted to understand the clinical 
      course and optimal management of this distinct entity. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: 
      NCT01802385.

TI  - [Clinical Value of Droplet Digital PCR and Super-ARMS Detection of Epidermal Growth 
      Factor Receptor Gene Mutation in Plasma Circulating Tumor DNA of Patients with 
      Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma].
PG  - 84-90
LID - 10.3779/j.issn.1009-3419.2020.02.03 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma should select targeted 
      drugs based on the type of tumor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene 
      mutation. However, it is difficult to collect tumor tissue of advanced lung 
      adenocarcinoma, and some experts agree that peripheral blood can be used as a 
      substitute for tumor tissue as a test specimen. This paper aimed to investigate the 
      clinical value of ddPCR and super-amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) in 
      detecting EGFR gene mutation in peripheral blood of patients with advanced lung 
      adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A total of 119 patients diagnosed in Beijing Chest Hospital 
      Affiliated to Capital Medical University from February 2016 to February 2019 were 
      collected, and the sensitivity and specificity of plasma ctDNA EGFR gene mutation 
      detected by ddPCR and super-arms were compared. Some patients with positive EGFR 
      gene mutations received oral treatment with first-line EGFR tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (EGFR-TKI). The patients were divided into subgroups according to the 
      test results. In group 1, both ddPCR and super-arms showed positive EGFR gene 
      mutation results, with 21 cases. In group 2, ddPCR and super-arms detection of EGFR 
      gene mutation were all negative, with 16 cases. In group 3, the ddPCR test was 
      positive and the super-arms test was negative, with 5 cases. In group 4, the ddPCR 
      test result was negative while the super-arms test result was positive. Since the 
      number of patients in group 4 was 0, no statistics were included. Objective response 
      rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were used to evaluate the short-term 
      outcome, and progression-free survival (PFS) was compared with survival analysis to 
      evaluate the long-term outcome. RESULTS: EGFR mutations were detected in 58 (48.7%) 
      of 119 patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. The coincidence rate between 
      ddPCR and EGFR gene mutation in tumor tissues was 82.4% (Kappa=0.647, P<0.001), the 
      sensitivity was 74.1%, and the specificity was 90.2%. However, the coincidence 
      degree of super-arms test and tissue test was 71.4%, the sensitivity was only 58.6%, 
      and the specificity was 83.6%. The ORR and DCR values in group 3 were lower than 
      those in group 1 and 2, but there was no significant difference in ORR between 
      groups (P>0.05). Survival analysis showed that the PFS of the three groups was 
      compared. The difference was not statistically significant (χ²=2.221, P=0.329). 
      CONCLUSIONS: ddPCR, as a high sensitivity and specificity liquid gene detection 
      method, can be used as a reliable method to detect the mutation of plasma ctDNA EGFR 
      gene in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. The results of plasma genetic 
      testing can also be used as the basis for predicting the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in 
      patients.

TI  - HIF-1 regulates heritable variation and allele expression phenotypes of the 
      macrophage immune response gene SLC11A1 from a Z-DNA forming microsatellite.
PG  - 3039-48
AB  - The Ity/Lsh/Bcg locus encodes the macrophage protein Slc11a1/Nramp1, which protects 
      inbred mice against infection by diverse intracellular pathogens including 
      Leishmania, Mycobacterium, and Salmonella. Human susceptibility to infectious and 
      inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, 
      and tuberculosis, shows allelic association with a highly polymorphic regulatory, 
      Z-DNA-forming microsatellite of (GT/AC)n dinucleotides within the proximal SLC11A1 
      promoter. We surmised that cis-acting allelic polymorphisms may underlie heritable 
      differences in SLC11A1 expression and phenotypic variation in disease risk. However, 
      it is unclear what may underlie such variation in SLC11A1 allele expression. Here we 
      show that hypoxia-inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) regulates allelic variation in SLC11A1 
      expression by binding directly to the microsatellite during macrophage activation by 
      infection or inflammation. Targeted Hif-1alpha ablation in murine macrophages 
      attenuated Slc11a11 expression and responsiveness to S typhimurium infection. Our 
      data also showed that HIF-1 may be functionally linked to complex prototypical 
      inflammatory diseases associated with certain SLC11A1 alleles. As these alleles are 
      highly polymorphic, our finding suggests that HIF-1 may influence heritable 
      variation in SLC11A1-dependent innate resistance to infection and inflammation 
      within and between populations. This report also suggests that microsatellites may 
      play critical roles in the directional evolution of complex heritable traits by 
      regulating gene expression phenotypes.

AB  - The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and its variations, such as the nested-PCR, have 
      been described as promising techniques for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). 
      With the aim of evaluating the usefulness of a nested-PCR method on samples of blood 
      and urine of patients suspected of tuberculosis we analyzed 192 clinical samples, 
      using as a molecular target the insertion element IS6110 specific of M. tuberculosis 
      genome. Nested-PCR method showed higher sensitivity in patients with extrapulmonary 
      tuberculosis (47.8% and 52% in blood and urine) when compared to patients with the 
      pulmonary form of the disease (sensitivity of 29% and 26.9% in blood and urine), 
      regardless of the type of biological sample used. The nested-PCR is a rapid 
      technique that, even if not showing a good sensitivity, should be considered as a 
      helpful tool especially in the extrapulmonary cases or in cases where confirmatory 
      diagnosis is quite difficult to be achieved by routine methods. The performance of 
      PCR-based techniques should be considered and tested in future works on other types 
      of biological specimens besides sputum, like blood and urine, readily obtainable in 
      most cases. The improving of M. tuberculosis nested-PCR detection in TB affected 
      patients will give the possibility of an earlier detection of bacilli thus 
      interrupting the transmission chain of the disease.

TI  - Vitamin D level and it is association with the severity of pulmonary tuberculosis in 
      patients attended to Kosti Teaching Hospital, Sudan.
PG  - 65-74
LID - 10.3934/microbiol.2020004 [doi]
AB  - Globally, tuberculosis is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in many 
      countries. Previous studies suggest that the incidence and severity of tuberculosis 
      are associated with low levels of vitamin D (Vit D). Therefore, this study aimed to 
      determine the occurrence and associated factors of vitamin D3 deficiency in 
      pulmonary tuberculosis patients at White Nile State, Sudan. 101 individuals of 
      diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis patients (71 males and 30 females) and 100 non-TB 
      controls (58 males and 42 females) were included in this study. Sputum samples were 
      obtained from TB patients and subjected to examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) 
      using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain and Gene Xpert analysis. Blood samples were collected 
      from both groups and Serum 25(OH)-vitamin D3 was determined by an Enzyme-Linked 
      Immunosorbent Assay. HIV infection in Tuberculosis (TB) group was also investigated 
      using the immunochromatographic test. In our study, the majority of TB patients were 
      suffered from TB relapse (36.6%); non-HIV infected individuals (99.1%) or showed a 
      positive result for AFB (61.4%) in Gene Xpert analysis. Moreover, there is a 
      significant difference in microscopy findings and bacillary levels of AFB, and 
      Rifampicin (RIF) susceptibility pattern of M. tuberculosis strain among sputum 
      samples of TB patients, P-values less 0.0001. Furthermore, we found that TB patients 
      were suffered from vitamin D deficiency. In particular, the mean of vitamin D level 
      was significantly much lower in TB patients (26.7 ± 1.6) compared to non-TB controls 
      (117.3 ± 3.2), P-value equal 0.0001. Likewise, it's much lower in females, 
      individuals of 21-40 years old, and patients with high bacillary levels or those 
      infected by Rifampicin resistance strain. Accordingly, our study was highlighted the 
      TB and Vit D deficiency relationship and showed the need for further studies to a 
      better understanding of the impact of TB on Vit D level and investigate whether 
      vitamin D supplementation can have a role in the prevention and treatment of 
      tuberculosis.

TI  - Relationship between female genital tract infections, mucosal interleukin-17 
      production and local T helper type 17 cells.
PG  - 557-67
LID - 10.1111/imm.12527 [doi]
AB  - T helper type 17 (Th17) cells play an important role in immunity to fungal and 
      bacterial pathogens, although their role in the female genital tract, where exposure 
      to these pathogens is common, is not well understood. We investigated the 
      relationship between female genital tract infections, cervicovaginal interleukin-17 
      (IL-17) concentrations and Th17 cell frequencies. Forty-two cytokines were measured 
      in cervicovaginal lavages from HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected women. Frequencies of 
      Th17 cells (CD3(+) CD4(+) IL-17a(+)) were evaluated in cervical cytobrushes and 
      blood by flow cytometry. Women were screened for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria 
      gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma genitalium, Trichomonas vaginalis and herpes simplex virus 2 
      by PCR, and candidal infections and bacterial vaginosis by Gram stain. Women with 
      bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), specifically chlamydia and 
      gonorrhoea, had higher genital IL-17 concentrations than women with no STI, whereas 
      women with candidal pseudohyphae/spores had lower IL-17 concentrations compared with 
      women without candidal infections. Viral STIs (herpes simplex virus 2 and HIV) were 
      not associated with significant changes in genital IL-17 concentrations. Genital 
      IL-17 concentrations correlated strongly with other inflammatory cytokines and 
      growth factors. Although Th17 cells were depleted from blood during HIV infection, 
      cervical Th17 cell frequencies were similar in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected 
      women. Cervical Th17 cell frequencies were also not associated with STIs or candida, 
      although few women had a STI. These findings suggest that IL-17 production in the 
      female genital tract is induced in response to bacterial but not viral STIs. 
      Decreased IL-17 associated with candidal infections suggests that candida may 
      actively suppress IL-17 production or women with dampened IL-17 responses may be 
      more susceptible to candidal outgrowth.

AB  - A boy developed ipsilateral axillary lymphadenitis after Bacillus Calmette-Guérin 
      (BCG) inoculation at the age of 5 months. Subsequently, he was diagnosed with 
      X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) by the nitroblue tetrazolium assay when 
      he was 4 years old. Body computerized tomography (CT) performed at the age of 25 
      years showed enlarged lymph nodes in the left periclavicular and axillary regions, 
      and was confirmed by gallium scintigraphy. Mycobacterial culture, smear, and 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the sputum and gastric fluid were negative. 
      Whole-blood IFN-gamma assay was negative as well. Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 
      isolated from the lymph node biopsy by PCR amplification and culture. No mutation of 
      the IFN-gamma receptor 1 could be identified. In conclusion, CGD can be the 
      underlying condition for BCG-itis; whole-blood IFN-gamma assay might be useful in 
      differentiating BCG infection and tuberculosis in CGD patients; BCG vaccination is 
      contraindicated in X-linked CGD.

AB  - Effective discrimination between lung cancer and benign tumours is a common clinical 
      problem in the differential diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodules. The analysis of 
      cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood may greatly aid the early detection of lung cancer by 
      evaluating cancer-related alterations. The plasma cfDNA levels and integrity were 
      analysed in 65 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, 28 subjects with benign 
      lung tumours, and 16 healthy controls using real-time PCR. The NSCLC patients 
      demonstrated significantly higher mean plasma cfDNA levels compared with those with 
      benign tumours (P = 0.0009) and healthy controls (P < 0.0001). The plasma cfDNA 
      integrity in healthy individuals was significantly different than that found in 
      patients with NSCLC or benign lung tumours (P < 0.0003). In ROC curve analysis, 
      plasma cfDNA levels >2.8 ng/ml provided 86.4% sensitivity and 61.4% specificity in 
      discriminating NSCLC from benign lung pathologies and healthy controls. cfDNA 
      integrity showed better discriminatory power (91% sensitivity, 68.2% specificity). 
      These data demonstrate that plasma cfDNA concentration and integrity analyses can 
      significantly differentiate between NSCLC and benign lung tumours. The diagnostic 
      capacity of the quantitative cfDNA assay is comparable to the values presented by 
      conventional imaging modalities used in clinical practice.

TI  - Matrix metalloproteinase 3 polymorphisms as a potential marker of enhanced 
      susceptibility to lung cancer in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease subjects.
PG  - 546-51
LID - 10.5604/12321966.1120599 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often 
      accompanied by lung cancer. Among the genes that may play a role in the occurrence 
      of COPD and lung cancer are those encoding the proteolytic enzymes, such as matrix 
      metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors. The objective of this study 
      was to find MMPs-associated markers useful in the identification of COPD subjects 
      with increased susceptibility to developing lung cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      compared the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes coding for matrix 
      proteinases (MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, MMP12) as well as tissue inhibitor of 
      metalloproteinases (TIMP1) in two groups of subjects: COPD patients (54 subjects) 
      and COPD patients diagnosed for lung cancer occurrence (53 subjects).The levels of 
      the respective proteins in blood serum were also analyzed. RESULTS: The frequencies 
      of 2 genotypes, MMP3 rs3025058 and MMP3 rs678815, were significantly different 
      between the studied groups. In both cases, more heterozygotes and less homozygotes 
      (both types) were observed in the COPD group than in the COPD + cancer group. A 
      significantly higher TIMP1 level in blood serum was observed in the COPD + cancer 
      group than in the COPD group. There were no statistically significant differences in 
      MMPs blood levels between the studied groups. In addition, no genotype-associated 
      differences in TIMP1 or MMPs blood levels were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Homozygocity 
      for MMP3 rs3025058 and rs678815 polymorphisms is a potential marker of enhanced 
      susceptibility to lung cancer development among COPD subjects.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Global tuberculosis (TB) control is restricted by the failure to detect 
      an estimated 3.3 million TB cases annually. In the majority of TB endemic settings, 
      sputum smear microscopy is used to diagnose TB, but this test is insensitive for TB 
      in its early stages. The objective of this study is to establish a concise gene 
      signature that discriminates between individuals with early TB disease, latent TB 
      infection (LTBI) and those without infection. METHODS: This is a case control study 
      nested within a cluster-randomised trial of population screening for active TB using 
      Xpert MTB/RIF. Whole blood samples from 303 participants with active TB (97), LTBI 
      (92) and uninfected individuals (114) were subject to transcriptomic analysis of 
      selected target genes based on a systematic review of previous studies. RESULTS: 
      Analysis of 82 genes identified a pattern of differentially expressed genes in TB 
      disease. A seven gene signature was identified that distinguished between TB disease 
      and no TB disease with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91), and between TB disease 
      from LTBI with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82-0.93). CONCLUSION: This gene signature 
      accurately distinguishes early TB disease from those without TB disease or 
      infection, in the context of community-wide TB screening. It could be used as a 
      non-sputum based screening tool or triage test to detect prevalent cases of TB in 
      the community.

LID - e00782-19
AB  - Pathogen cell-free DNA (pcfDNA) in blood and urine is an attractive biomarker; 
      however, the impact of preanalytical factors is not well understood. Blood and urine 
      samples from healthy donors spiked with cfDNA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
      Salmonella enterica, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and samples 
      from tuberculosis patients were used to evaluate the impact of blood collection 
      tube, urine preservative, processing delay, processing method, freezing and thawing, 
      and sample volume on pcfDNA. The PCR cycle threshold (C(T) ) was used to measure 
      amplifiable cfDNA. In spiked samples, the median C(T) values for M. tuberculosis, S. 
      enterica, and EBV cfDNA were significantly lower in blood collected in K(2)EDTA 
      tubes than those in Streck and PAXgene blood collection tubes, and they were was 
      significantly lower in urine preserved with EDTA (EDTA-urine) than in urine 
      preserved with Streck reagent (Streck-urine). Blood and urine samples from TB 
      patients preserved with K(2)EDTA and Tris-EDTA, respectively, showed significantly 
      lower median M. tuberculosis C(T) values than with the Streck blood collection tube 
      and Streck urine preservative. Processing delay increased the median pathogen C(T) 
      values for Streck and PAXgene but not K(2)EDTA blood samples and for urine preserved 
      with Streck reagent but not EDTA. Double-spin compared with single-spin plasma 
      separation increased the median pathogen C(T) regardless of blood collection tube. 
      No differences were observed between whole urine and supernatant and between fresh 
      and thawed plasma and urine after 24 weeks at -80°C. Larger plasma and urine volumes 
      in contrived and patient samples showed a significantly lower median M. tuberculosis 
      C(T) These findings suggest that large-volume single-spin K(2)EDTA-plasma and 
      EDTA-whole urine with up to a 24-h processing delay may optimize pcfDNA detection.

AB  - We have developed a simple, economical and reproducible method for processing blood 
      samples from HIV infected patients for diagnosis of tuberculosis. The procedure was 
      validated on 55 samples selected for tuberculosis based on clinical criteria. 52 
      patients had radiological changes indicative of pulmonary tuberculosis of which only 
      28 were positive for AFB in sputum (sensitivity 54%) and 27 for tuberculin 
      (sensitivity 52%). 26 HIV positive patients who showed positive X-ray did not react 
      to tuberculin. The genus PCR probe missed 3 samples (sensitivity 94%) compared to 
      X-ray.M.tuberculosis was detected in the blood of all X-ray positive cases by PCR 
      using TB400 probe (sensitivity 100%) and another probe forM. tuberculosis, IS6110, 
      missed 6 of them (sensitivity 88% compared to X-ray and 89% compared to TB400). It 
      is proposed that this simple sample processing method could be used to screen all 
      blood samples quickly for mycobacteremia using the genus PCR and only those positive 
      for mycobacteria need to be tested forM.tuberculosis. This would save the scarce 
      resources and time by reducing significantly the number of samples to be screened 
      for species confirmation.

TI  - Fusion expression of major antigenic segment of JEV E protein-hsp70 and the 
      identification of domain acting as adjuvant in hsp70.
PG  - 288-96
AB  - Hsp70 potentiates specific immune responses to some antigenic peptides fused to it. 
      A recombinant hsp70 protein expression vector in methylotrophic yeast, Pichia 
      pastoris, was developed that fused the major antigenic segment of Japanese 
      encephalitis virus (JEV) E protein to the amino terminus of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis hsp70. The C-terminal peptide binding domain of hsp70 stimulated 
      Th1-polarizing cytokines, CC chemokines and an adjuvant effect. However, the 
      N-terminal ATPase domain (hsp70 1-358) failed to stimulate any of these cytokines or 
      chemokines. Based on these data, a vector was constructed that permits the fusion of 
      major antigenic segment of E protein to the amino terminus of peptide binding domain 
      of hsp70. Antibody titers, lymphocytes proliferation, the level of mIL-2 or 
      mIFN-gamma and neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice showed that antigenicity of 
      E-binding domain fusion protein was almost as effective as E-hsp70 fusion protein 
      and more effective than carrier protein hsp70 alone. In eliciting a humoral and 
      cellular immune response, both fusion proteins were more powerful than the major 
      antigenic segment of E protein alone, but less effective than the segment 
      administered with Freund's adjuvant.

TI  - Etiological diagnosis of granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis in the tropics.
PG  - 524-30
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfv071 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Granulomatous tubulointerstitial nephritis (GIN) is common due to 
      infections, drugs or sarcoidosis. However, the cause is often difficult to establish 
      and the studies are limited. We studied the etiology of GIN and compared the 
      clinical and histological features and outcome in different etiologies at a tertiary 
      care center in North India. METHODS: Renaö biopsies from GIN cases diagnosed from 
      January 2004 to April 2014 were retrieved. Stain for acid fast bacilli was performed 
      in all biopsies. Etiological diagnosis was based on clinical features, extra-renal 
      manifestations, radiology, history of drug intake and demonstration of infective 
      agent. Tissue PCR for tubercular DNA was performed in seven biopsies. RESULTS: 
      Seventeen GIN patients [mean age 35 ± 15 years; males 11] were identified. 
      Tuberculosis was the commonest etiology followed by idiopathic, sarcoidosis and 
      fungal. Both tuberculosis and sarcoidosis patients presented with subnephrotic 
      proteinuria and raised serum creatinine. Acid fast bacilli were demonstrated in 1/9 
      and necrosis was demonstrated in 3/9 granulomas in tuberculosis. Tissue PCR for 
      tubercular DNA was positive in six TB patients and negative in one sarcoidosis 
      patient. Patients responded well to appropriate therapy. CONCLUSION: Etiological 
      diagnosis of GIN is essential for timely and appropriate therapy. Tuberculosis is 
      the commonest etiology (53%) in the tropics. Necrosis in granuloma, demonstration of 
      acid fast bacilli, blood interferon gamma release assay and urine culture is not 
      sensitive for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in GIN. Our findings suggest that tissue 
      PCR for tuberculosis performed in an appropriate clinical setting is useful in the 
      diagnostic evaluation of GIN.

AB  - A flow cytometric assay measuring Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD4 T-cell 
      responses using co-expression of CD25/CD134 (OX40 assay) was explored as a 
      diagnostic tool for active tuberculosis (TB) in a Thai population with and without 
      HIV infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from 133 
      participants at TB diagnosis were cryopreserved. Seventy-six participants had a 
      clinical diagnosis of TB which were confirmed by a positive culture. CD4 T-cell 
      responses were measured after stimulation with a pool of overlapping peptides 
      covering RD-1 antigens: CFP-10 + ESAT-6. The performance of the assay was also 
      compared to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The overall sensitivity of the OX40 assay was 
      94.7% (95%CI 87.1-98.5); its specificity was 71.9% (95%CI, 58.5-83). The sensitivity 
      of the OX40 assay among HIV-infected participants was 100% (95%CI, 88.8-100) with a 
      specificity of 92.9% (95%CI, 66.1-99.8). OX40 assay performed particularly well in 
      those with active TB and HIV infection.

TI  - Early appearing gamma/delta-bearing T cells during infection with Calmétte Guérin 
      bacillus.
PG  - 2754-62
AB  - To search for a potential role of TCR gamma/delta T cells in host-defense against 
      mycobacterial infection, we analyzed the kinetics, repertoire, specificity, and 
      cytokine production of gamma/delta T cells in the peritoneal exudate cells (PEC), 
      lymph node (LN) cells and spleen cells during an i.p. infection with a sublethal 
      dose (5 x 10(5) of viable Bacillus Calmétte-Guérin (BCG) in mice. In the PEC on day 
      7 after infection, approximately 26% of the CD3+ cells were CD4-CD8-, most of which 
      expressed TCR gamma/delta on their surface. However, the PEC on day 28 contained an 
      increased number of alpha/beta T cells that were CD4+8- or CD4-8+ and the proportion 
      of gamma/delta T cells in the PEC reciprocally decreased to 18% of the CD3+ cells. 
      The kinetics of gamma/delta and alpha/beta T cells in the LN during BCG infection 
      showed in much the same pattern as that seen in the PEC. When purified CD4-CD8- 
      cells in the LN on day 7 after BCG infection were cultured with sonicated BCG 
      lysate, PPD derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis or recombinant 65 kDa heat shock 
      protein derived from Mycobacterium bovis, the gamma/delta T cells on this stage 
      significantly proliferated and secreted IL-2 in response to sonicated BCG lysate and 
      PPD but not to 65 kDa heat shock protein. V gene segment usage analysis with PCR 
      method revealed that purified protein derivative-reactive gamma/delta T cells 
      preferentially used V gamma 1/2/V delta 6, whereas gamma/delta T cells polyclonally 
      expanded in response to the BCG lysate. These results suggest that gamma/delta T 
      cells specific for mycobacterial antigens preceding alpha/beta T cells in appearance 
      during infection may serve as a first line of defense against mycobacterial 
      infection.

TI  - Comparison of multiplex and ordinary PCR for diagnosis of paratuberculosis and 
      tuberculosis in blood samples (buffy coat) of cattle and buffaloes.
PG  - 52-56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Paratuberculosis and tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium avium 
      paratuberculosis (MAP) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC), respectively 
      are economically important, chronic debilitating diseases affecting the dairy herds 
      and are also potential zoonotic threats. AIMS: Differential diagnosis of 
      paratuberculosis and TB in blood samples of cattle and buffaloes. METHODS: In this 
      study, an in-house developed multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting 
      MAP, Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium smegmatis was used in blood samples 
      (buffy coat) parallel with IS900 PCR and esxB PCR for diagnosis of paratuberculosis 
      and TB, respectively; in a total of 202 cattle and buffaloes. RESULTS: Out of 202 
      animals, 12 (5.9%) and 17 (8.4%) animals were positive for MAP by multiplex PCR and 
      IS900 PCR, respectively; from which only 8 (4%) animals were positive by both tests; 
      whereas 4 and 9 animals were exclusively positive by multiplex PCR and IS900 PCR, 
      respectively. None of the animals were found to be positive for M. bovis and M. 
      smegmatis by the multiplex PCR. However, the esxB PCR detected 13 (6.4%) animals 
      positive for TB. In fact, 3 (1.5%) animals were found to be co-infected by both 
      paratuberculosis and TB. CONCLUSION: The in-house multiplex PCR detected MAP in 
      buffy coat and there was a fair degree of agreement between the multiplex PCR and 
      IS900 PCR in detection of MAP DNA though the latter detected more number of animals 
      to be positive for MAP. Besides, esxB PCR showed a high diagnostic potential and can 
      be used for diagnosis of TB from blood.

TI  - [Case of acute primary HIV infection with menigoencephalitis demonstrating high 
      signal intensity of the bilateral globus pallidus in T2-weighted MRI].
PG  - 597-600
AB  - A slightly obtunded 59-year-old man admitted for headache and consciousness 
      disturbance after two weeks of fever, sore throat, and general malaise. His 
      cerebrospinal fluid showed a slight increase in the white cell count and protein 
      content. T2-weighted MRI demonstrated high signal intensity of the bilateral globus 
      pallidus. Cerebrospinal fluid culture was negative for fungi and bacteria, including 
      mycobacterium tuberculosis. Negative results for PCR and ELISA made herpes simplex 
      virus encephalitis unlikely. We treated him empirically with aciclovir and 
      cefpirome, conducting further tests because a HIV serological test was positive on 
      admission. HIV RNA was 2.9 x 10(5) copies/ml in the blood. Western blot analysis 
      demonstrated positive bands at gp160, p24, p55, and p68, but negative at gp120, p52, 
      gp41, p40, p34, and p18. These results yielded a definitive diagnosis of acute 
      primary HIV infection presenting as meningoencephalitis. His clinical condition 
      improved over the next few days. Repeated MRI showed a new lesion in the pons on 
      T2-weighted images. No MRI abnormality has reported previously in acute primary HIV 
      infection with meningoencephalitis. High signal intensity in the bilateral globus 
      pallidus and the pons in patients with meningoencephalitis may thus be a useful 
      indicator for acute primary HIV infection.

TI  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-tubercular mycobacterium infection in women with 
      unexplained infertility from eastern India.
PG  - 557-562
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genital tuberculosis (GTB) is an important cause of female infertility, 
      especially in developing countries. The positive results of polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) in endometrial GTB in the absence of tubal damage raise the 
      possibility of the detection of sub-clinical or latent disease, with doubtful 
      benefits of treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis (MTB) and Non-tubercular Mycobacterium (NTM) infection by using 
      Real-PCR technique in the menstrual blood samples of 120 unexplained infertile 
      women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 120 infertile women 
      with unexplained infertility aged 20-35 yr old and normal hysterosalpingography 
      findings were taken. Menstrual blood in the first 12 hr of menstruation containing 
      the endometrial tissues from each participant was tested for MTB and NTM by 
      Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: Among the selected 120 patients, only two were found to be 
      positive for MTB infection. All remaining participants were negative for MTB 
      infection. All participants were negative for NTM infection at the endometrium. 
      CONCLUSION: Although, studies have indicated that PCR is a useful method in 
      diagnosing early GTB disease in infertile women with no demonstrable evidence of 
      tubal or endometrial involvement, our study showed that GTB is not the major problem 
      in women with unexplained infertility.

TI  - The usefulness of PCR amplification of the IS6110 insertion element of M. 
      tuberculosis complex in ascitic fluid of patients with peritoneal tuberculosis.
PG  - 367-371
AB  - Background: The diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis (TP) may be difficult and 
      elusive. The present study was designed to demonstrate the diagnostic usefulness of 
      a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, specific for the IS6110 insertion 
      element of M. tuberculosis complex, in patients with ascites who were suspected of 
      having TP in order to achieve a more timely diagnosis and treatment. Methods: Three 
      HIV-negative patients suffering from fever and ascites were evaluated for suspected 
      TP. Specimens were obtained from ascitic fluid, bone marrow, and peripheral blood 
      and analyzed by both conventional methods and nested PCR for the presence of 
      bacilli. Response to antituberculous treatment was considered as the final criterion 
      for diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis. Results: All three patients had an 
      excellent response to antituberculous therapy. Our PCR-based protocol detected M. 
      tuberculosis complex DNA in the ascitic fluid of all patients, whereas conventional 
      methods failed to establish the disease. Furthermore, in one patient, M. 
      tuberculosis was also detected in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. 
      Conclusions: PCR amplification of the IS6110 sequence of M. tuberculosis complex in 
      ascitic fluid is a useful tool when peritoneal tuberculosis is suspected. However, 
      its validity still needs to be established.

TI  - The regulatory role of heat shock protein 70-reactive CD4+ T cells during rat 
      listeriosis.
PG  - 117-30
AB  - Protection against infection with Listeria monocytogenes depends primarily on 
      Listeria-specific T cells. We show here that CD4+ TCR alphabeta+ T cells are capable 
      of recognizing the mycobacterial heat shock protein (HSP) 70, that appears in the 
      peritoneal cavity of F344 rats infected i.p. with L. monocytogenes. The 
      HSP70-reactive CD4+ T cells recognized a peptide comprising 234-252 residues as 
      present in the 70 kDa HSP of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the context of RT1.B MHC 
      class II molecules. Analysis of TCR Vbeta gene expression with RT-PCR revealed that 
      the HSP70-reactive CD4+ T cells predominantly used the Vbeta16 gene segment, whereas 
      the heat-killed Listeria (HKL)-specific T cells expressed a diverse set of Vbeta 
      gene segments. In contrast to the HKL-specific T cells producing IFN-gamma, the 
      HSP70-reactive CD4+ T cells produced TGF-beta1 and IL-10 but neither Th1- or 
      Th2-type cytokines. Adoptive transfer with HSP70-reactive T cells rendered rats 
      susceptible to listerial infection. Collectively, these results proposed that the 
      HSP70-reactive CD4+ T cells appearing during rat listeriosis may be involved in 
      termination of Th1 cell-mediated excessive inflammation after the battle against L. 
      monocytogenes has been won.

LID - 11
AB  - Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most devastating form of tuberculosis (TB) but 
      diagnosis is difficult and delays in initiating therapy increase mortality. All 
      currently available tests are imperfect; culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from 
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is considered the most accurate test but is often 
      negative, even when disease is present, and takes too long to be useful for 
      immediate decision making. Rapid tests that are frequently used are conventional 
      Ziehl-Neelsen staining and nucleic acid amplification tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF 
      and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra. While positive results will often confirm the diagnosis, 
      negative tests frequently provide insufficient evidence to withhold therapy. The 
      conventional diagnostic approach is to determine the probability of TBM using 
      experience and intuition, based on prevalence of TB, history, examination, analysis 
      of basic blood and CSF parameters, imaging, and rapid test results. Treatment 
      decisions may therefore be both variable and inaccurate, depend on the experience of 
      the clinician, and requests for tests may be inappropriate. In this article we 
      discuss the use of Bayes' theorem and the threshold model of decision making as ways 
      to improve testing and treatment decisions in TBM. Bayes' theorem describes the 
      process of converting the pre-test probability of disease to the post-test 
      probability based on test results and the threshold model guides clinicians to make 
      rational test and treatment decisions. We discuss the advantages and limitations of 
      using these methods and suggest that new diagnostic strategies should ultimately be 
      tested in randomised trials.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Interferon Gamma-Induced Protein 10 mRNA Release Assay for 
      Tuberculosis.
LID - 10.1128/JCM.00848-20 [doi]
LID - e00848-20
AB  - Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs) are increasingly used to test for 
      latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Although highly specific, IGRAs have a 
      relatively high false-negative rate in active TB patients. A more sensitive assay is 
      needed. IFN-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10) is an alternative biomarker with a 
      100-fold-higher expression level than IFN-γ, allowing for different analysis 
      platforms, including molecular detection. The PCR technique is already an integrated 
      tool in most TB laboratories and, thus, an obvious platform to turn to. In this 
      case-control study, we investigated the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of a 
      molecular assay detecting IP-10 mRNA expression following antigen stimulation of a 
      blood sample. We included 89 TB patients and 99 healthy controls. Blood was drawn in 
      QuantiFeron-TB gold in-tube (QFT) assay tubes. Eight hours poststimulation, IP-10 
      mRNA expression was analyzed, and 20 h poststimulation, IP-10 and IFN-γ protein 
      plasma levels were analyzed using an in-house IP-10 enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) and the official QFT ELISA, respectively. The IP-10 mRNA assay 
      provided high specificity (98%), sensitivity (80%), and area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) (0.97); however, the QFT assay provided a higher 
      overall diagnostic potential, with specificity of 100%, sensitivity of 90%, and AUC 
      of 0.99. The IP-10 protein assay performed on par with the QFT assay, with 
      specificity of 98%, sensitivity of 87%, and AUC of 0.98. We have provided proof of 
      high technical performance of a molecular assay detecting IP-10 mRNA expression. As 
      a diagnostic tool, this assay would gain from further optimization, especially on 
      the kinetics of IP-10 mRNA expression.

TI  - [Correlation between the mRNA levels of carcinoembryonic antigen and cytokeratin 19 
      in peripheral blood with staging, treatment response and prognosis in patients with 
      lung cancer].
PG  - 773-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and 
      cytokeratin19 (CK19) mRNAs in peripheral blood of patients with lung cancer and 
      their correlation with staging, treatment response and prognosis. METHODS: CEA and 
      CK19 mRNAs in peripheral blood were detected by Taq Man reverse 
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 78 patients with lung cancer 
      before and after treatment, 30 patients with benign lung diseases and 30 healthy 
      subjects. Serum CEA and CYFRA21-1 levels were also measured by enzyme linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the 78 patients with lung cancer before treatment. 
      The patients were followed for 2 years. RESULTS: The positive rates of CEA mRNA and 
      CK19 mRNA in patients with lung cancer were 69.2% (54/78) and 62.8% (49/78), 
      respectively, which were significantly higher than those in patients with benign 
      lung diseases and the healthy controls (P < 0.01). The positive rate of CEA mRNA was 
      the highest in adenocarcinoma, while the positive rate of CK19 mRNA was the highest 
      in squamous cell carcinoma. There was no statistically significant difference among 
      different stages (P > 0.05), The positive rates of CEA mRNA and CK19 mRNA were 
      higher than those of serum CEA and CYFRA21-1. The positive rates of CEA mRNA and 
      CK19 mRNA decreased significantly after surgical operation, but there was no 
      significant change after chemotherapy. The median survival time (MST) for patients 
      with a positive CEA mRNA before chemotherapy was shorter than those with a negative 
      CEA mRNA (8.5 month and 11.7 month, respectively). The MST for patients with a 
      positive CK19 mRNA before chemotherapy was shorter than those with a negative CK19 
      mRNA (8.9 month and 12.3 month, respectively). The rate of relapse and metastasis 
      was higher in patients (29.4%) with a positive CEA mRNA preoperatively than those 
      with a negative CEA mRNA (7.7%). The rate of relapse and metastasis was also higher 
      in patients with a positive CK19 mRNA preoperatively (18.8%) as compared to those 
      with a negative PCR result (7.1%). CONCLUSIONS: CEA and CK19 mRNAs can be used as 
      markers in the detection of tumor micrometastases in lung cancer, and in evaluating 
      surgical response and prognosis. The results suggest that the gene markers are 
      better than the serum ones, and therefore may be useful for the early diagnosis of 
      lung cancer.

TI  - Construction of naïve camelids VHH repertoire in phage display-based library.

AB  - Camelids have unique antibodies, namely HCAbs (VHH) or commercially named 
      Nanobodies(®) (Nb) that are composed only of a heavy-chain homodimer. As libraries 
      based on immunized camelids are time-consuming, costly and likely redundant for 
      certain antigens, we describe the construction of a naïve camelid VHHs library from 
      blood serum of non-immunized camelids with affinity in the subnanomolar range and 
      suitable for standard immune applications. This approach is rapid and recovers VHH 
      repertoire with the advantages of being more diverse, non-specific and devoid of 
      subpopulations of specific antibodies, which allows the identification of binders 
      for any potential antigen (or pathogen). RNAs from a number of camelids from Saudi 
      Arabia were isolated and cDNAs of the diverse vhh gene were amplified; the resulting 
      amplicons were cloned in the phage display pSEX81 vector. The size of the library 
      was found to be within the required range (10(7)) suitable for subsequent 
      applications in disease diagnosis and treatment. Two hundred clones were randomly 
      selected and the inserted gene library was either estimated for redundancy or 
      sequenced and aligned to the reference camelid vhh gene (acc. No. ADE99145). Results 
      indicated complete non-specificity of this small library in which no single event of 
      redundancy was detected. These results indicate the efficacy of following this 
      approach in order to yield a large and diverse enough gene library to secure the 
      presence of the required version encoding the required antibodies for any target 
      antigen. This work is a first step towards the construction of phage display-based 
      biosensors useful in disease (e.g., TB or tuberculosis) diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - N-acetyltransferase and cytochrome P450 2E1 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to 
      antituberculosis drug hepatotoxicity in an Indian population.
PG  - 260-5
AB  - Background. Antituberculosis drug hepatotoxicity (ATDH) is common in India. 
      Isoniazid, a constituent of most anti- tuberculosis drug regimens, is metabolized by 
      N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) enzymes. We therefore 
      studied the association of some single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these 
      enzyme genes with ATDH. Methods. Allelic and genotypic frequencies at three SNP loci 
      in the NAT2 gene (rs1799929, rs1799930 and rs1799931) and one locus (rs2031920) in 
      the CYP2E1 gene were studied using restriction fragment length polymorphism in 33 
      patients who developed ATDH following an isoniazid- containing antituberculosis drug 
      regimen and 173 healthy blood donors. After confirming adherence of the control data 
      to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model, genotype and allele frequencies in the two 
      groups were compared. Results. For SNP rs1799930 in the NAT2 gene, 7 (21%), 21 (64%) 
      and 5 (15%) patients, and 93 (54%), 62 (36%) and 18 (10%) controls had GG, GA and AA 
      genotypes, respectively (p=0.003; odds ratio [OR] for GA v. GG=4.50 [95% CI 
      1.80-11.22] and for AA v. GG=3.69 [1.05-12.93]). Allele frequency for G nucleotides 
      for this SNP was 0.53 among patients and 0.72 among controls (OR 2.24 [1.31-3.84], 
      p=0.007). The allele and genotype frequencies of the other NAT2 SNPs and the CYP2E1 
      SNP showed no significant difference between cases and controls. All the 33 patients 
      and 151 (87%) of 173 controls had mutant allele at one or more of the three NAT2 SNP 
      loci (p=0.03). The presence of two or more mutant alleles, a marker of slow 
      acetylator status, was more frequent in patients (23/33 [70%]) than in controls 
      (73/173 [42%]; OR 3.23 [95% CI 1.45-7.19], p=0.004). Conclusion. In India, the risk 
      of ATDH is increased in persons with 'A' allele at SNP rs1799930 in the NAT2 gene, 
      but is not associated with rs2031920 polymorphism in the CYP2E1 gene.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in serum samples, 
      in the diagnosis of osteoarticular tuberculosis (OTB) in a setting where only 
      clinical and imaging diagnoses determine the treatment. METHODS: A total of 44 
      consecutive serum specimens were collected from clinically suspected OTB patients, 
      based on clinical and radiological [X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging/computed 
      tomography] features. They were screened by in-house nested PCR. In addition, a few 
      specimens were examined by Gram stain, acid-fast bacilli stain, histopathology and 
      routine bacterial culture. A total of 39 specimens were collected from patients 
      suffering from other bone diseases of nontuberculous origin and included as negative 
      controls. RESULTS: Of the 44 clinically suspected OTB patients, in-house nested PCR 
      was positive in 40 (91%) cases; PCR was negative in 38 (97%) negative controls. 
      Sensitivity and specificity of our in-house nested PCR was 90.9% and 97.4%, 
      respectively. The PCR report was available within 48 h. It was possible to 
      standardize serum PCR technique and in positive cases, a good correlation was 
      observed in terms of an adequate treatment response. CONCLUSIONS: Nested PCR in 
      serum samples is a rapid, highly sensitive and specific modality for OTB detection. 
      PCR should be performed in addition to clinical evaluation, imaging studies, 
      acid-fast bacilli staining, culture and histopathology diagnosis, if possible.

TI  - Contribution of MINCLE-SYK Signaling to Activation of Primary Human APCs by 
      Mycobacterial Cord Factor and the Novel Adjuvant TDB.
PG  - 2417-28
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.1500102 [doi]
AB  - Trehalose-6,6-dimycolate (TDM), the mycobacterial cord factor, is an abundant cell 
      wall glycolipid and major virulence factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Its 
      synthetic analog trehalose-6,6-dibehenate (TDB) is a new adjuvant currently in phase 
      I clinical trials. In rodents, the C-type lectin receptors Mincle and Mcl bind 
      TDB/TDM and activate macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) through the Syk-Card9 
      pathway. However, it is unknown whether these glycolipids activate human innate 
      immune cells through the same mechanism. We performed in vitro analysis of 
      TDB/TDM-stimulated primary human monocytes, macrophages, and DC; determined C-type 
      lectin receptor expression; and tested the contribution of SYK, MINCLE, and MCL by 
      small interfering RNA knockdown and genetic complementation. We observed a robust 
      chemokine and cytokine release in response to TDB or TDM. MCSF-driven macrophages 
      secreted higher levels of IL-8, IL-6, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL2 after stimulation with 
      TDM, whereas DC responded more strongly to TDB and GM-CSF-driven macrophages were 
      equally responsive to TDB and TDM. SYK kinase and the adaptor protein CARD9 were 
      essential for glycolipid-induced IL-8 production. mRNA expression of MINCLE and MCL 
      was high in monocytes and macrophages, with MINCLE and MCL proteins localized 
      intracellularly under resting conditions. Small interfering RNA-mediated MINCLE or 
      MCL knockdown caused on average reduced TDB- or TDM-induced IL-8 production. 
      Conversely, retroviral expression in murine Mincle-deficient DC revealed that human 
      MINCLE, but not MCL, was sufficient to confer responsiveness to TDB/TDM. Our study 
      demonstrates that SYK-CARD9 signaling plays a key role in TDB/TDM-induced activation 
      of innate immune cells in man as in mouse, likely by engagement of MINCLE.

TI  - Early diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis in a hemodialysis patient by combining two 
      interferon-γ-release assays: a case report.
PG  - 214
LID - 10.1186/s12882-020-01875-w [doi]
LID - 214
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis 
      (HD) are at high risk to develop tuberculosis (TB) associated with a high mortality 
      rate. TB diagnosis is often delayed due to non-specific symptoms, frequent 
      extra-pulmonary manifestations, and rare microbiological confirmation. This case 
      report illustrates the clear added value of combined interferon-γ -release assays 
      (IGRA) in response to different mycobacterial antigens for an early diagnosis of TB 
      in HD patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of an Egyptian patient under 
      chronic HD treatment, who presented with recurrent episodes of fever and myalgia of 
      unknown origin, associated with an important inflammatory syndrome. These episodes 
      resolved partially or completely within less than 1 month without any treatment but 
      recurred 10 times within 3 years. Chest Computed Tomography and 
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (18FDG 
      PET-CT) demonstrated several active mediastinal lymphadenopathies. TB was the first 
      suspected diagnosis but cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remained 
      negative on a mediastinal lymph node aspiration. In contrast, the results from two 
      different IGRA performed on blood were highly suggestive of TB disease. Several 
      granulomas, some of them with central non-caseating necrosis, were demonstrated on a 
      pulmonary nodule obtained by thoracoscopic resection, but PCR and culture remained 
      negative for M. tuberculosis. Three years after the initial symptoms, a new PET-CT 
      revealed a retro-clavicular lymphadenopathy in addition to the mediastinal 
      lymphadenopathies, and the M. tuberculosis culture performed on the resected 
      lymphadenopathy was positive. Antibiotic treatment for TB was started and resulted 
      in a clear improvement of the patient's clinical condition, allowing him to 
      successfully receive a renal graft. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the high frequency of TB 
      in patients undergoing chronic HD and of the limitations of the classical diagnosis 
      procedures, nephrologists have to diagnose TB mostly on clinical suspicion. We 
      demonstrate here that the use of a combined IGRA to two different mycobacterial 
      antigens may significantly raise the index of suspicion and help clinicians to 
      decide starting anti-TB treatment in HD patients.

TI  - Evaluating pre- and post-operation plasma miRNAs of papillary thyroid carcinoma 
      (PTC) patients in comparison to benign nodules.
PG  - 690
LID - 10.1186/s12885-019-5849-0 [doi]
LID - 690
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrinology cancer that its 
      incidence has increased in recent decades. miRNAs are new biomarkers in recent 
      studies in the diagnosis and follow-up of these patients. METHODS: Blood and thyroid 
      tissue samples were obtained from two groups of included patients (PTC and benign 
      nodules), pre- and post-operation. miRNAs were extracted from these plasma samples 
      and were measured quantitatively. After cDNA synthesis, qPCR was carried out. Then 
      tissue samples were investigated, and their relation to miR expression was studied. 
      These results were analyzed by paired- and independent samples t-test, and 
      non-parametric tests. RESULTS: miR-222 and miR-181a declined in PTC patients before 
      and after surgery, significantly (P < 0.001 for both groups), with no significant 
      difference in control group before and after surgery (P = 0.61 for miR-222 and 
      P = 0.06 for miR-181a). The difference between the two groups, pre-and 
      post-operation, was statistically significant (P = 0.01 for miR-222 and P < 0.001 
      for miR-181a). Comparing case and control groups, pre- and post-operatively, yielded 
      no significant difference, in miR-155-5p levels (P = 0.61 and P = 0.53, 
      respectively). Comparing PTC and control groups before surgery showed a significant 
      difference (P = 0.01), while no significant difference was observed comparing them 
      after surgery, in miR146-a (P = 0.27). Our results depicted a higher miR-155-5p and 
      miR-146a expression before surgery than after it (P < 0.001 in both groups, for both 
      miRs). We found a significant relationship between miR-222 and BRAFV600E mutation 
      and significantly higher levels of miR-181a with increasing tumor size in PTC 
      patients. CONCLUSION: miR-222 showed overexpression in all PTC cases, which is 
      indicative of a relation between miRNA and PTC. Also, comparing miR-181 and miR-146a 
      showed a significant difference between cancerous and benign cases. miR-155-5p as an 
      inflammatory factor, showed no significant changes, comparing two groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterial species other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis and 
      Mycobacterium leprae are generally free-living organisms and Mycobacterium simiae is 
      one of the slowest growing Non-tuberculous mycobacteria. This is the first case 
      report of Mycobacterium simiae infection in Sri Lanka and only very few cases with 
      extrapulmonary manifestation reported in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 
      24-year-old, previously healthy Sri Lankan male presented with generalized 
      lymphadenopathy with discharging sinuses, evening pyrexia, weight loss, poor 
      appetite and splenomegaly. Lymph node biopsies showed sheets of macrophages packed 
      with organisms in the absence of granulomata. Ziehl Neelsen, Wade Fite and Giemsa 
      stains revealed numerous red coloured acid-fast bacilli within foamy histiocytes. 
      Slit skin smear for leprosy was negative and tuberculosis, fungal and bacterial 
      cultures of the lymph node and bone marrow did not reveal any growth. Later he 
      developed watery diarrhea and colonoscopy revealed multiple small polyps and ulcers 
      throughout the colon extending up to the ileum, Which was confirmed to be due to 
      cytomegalovirus confirmed by PCR and successfully treated with ganciclovir. Positron 
      emission tomography scan guided biopsies of the gut and lymph nodes confirmed 
      presence of mycobacterial spindle cell pseudo-tumours and PCR assays revealed 
      positive HSP65. The culture grew Mycobacterium Simiae. Flow cytometry analysis on 
      patient's blood showed extremely low T and B cell counts and immunofixation revealed 
      low immunoglobulin levels. His condition was later diagnosed as adult onset 
      immunodeficiency due to anti- interferon - gamma autoantibodies. He was initially 
      commenced on empirical anti-TB treatment with atypical mycobacterial coverage. He is 
      currently on a combination of daily clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid with 
      monthly 2 g/kg/intravenous immunoglobulin to which, he had a remarkable clinical 
      response with complete resolution of lymphadenopathy and healing of sinuses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This infection is considered to be restricted to certain geographic 
      areas such as mainly Iran, Cuba, Israel and Arizona and this is the first case 
      report from Sri lanka. Even though the infection is mostly seen in the elderly 
      patients, our patient was only 24 years old. In the literature pulmonary involvement 
      was common presentation, but in this case the patient had generalized 
      lymphadenopathy and colonic involvement without pulmonary involvement.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study is to compare the results of nested polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) for early detection of genital tuberculosis (GTB) using menstrual 
      blood (MB) and endometrial tissue (ET) as samples in females presenting as 
      infertility. METHODS: The ET and MB samples were collected from a total of 194 
      females, enrolled in this study. DNA isolation from samples was done using standard, 
      phenol-chloroform method. Heat shock protein gene (hsp65/groEL2) of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis was targeted and amplified, and the final products were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: Overall, 126 (65%) cases of infertility were positive for M. tuberculosis 
      complex by nested PCR. The detection rates in the two samples were statistically 
      insignificant. The combined positivity rate of ET and MB, when compared with 
      positivity rate in MB showed a positive predictive value, negative predictive value, 
      and accuracy of 100%, 68.7%, and 84%, respectively. The results of nested PCR using 
      MB as sample alone showed good agreement with the nested PCR results of the combined 
      samples. CONCLUSIONS: The hsp65 Nested PCR of MB can be used as a noninvasive 
      screening test for early diagnosis of GTB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is a neglected disease that has been 
      restricted to East Africa for many decades. Several cases in refugees from the Horn 
      of Africa have been recently diagnosed in four European countries. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: We report four additional cases of LBRF in asylum seekers from Somalia 
      and Eritrea who presented with fever shortly after arriving in Switzerland during a 
      seven-month period. Multiple spirochetes were visualized on stained blood films 
      which were identified as Borrelia recurrentis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. All 
      patients recovered after antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone and/or doxycycline. 
      Concurrent infections (malaria and tuberculosis) were diagnosed in half of our 
      patients. Possible modes of transmission and preventive measures are discussed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These reported cases highlight the ongoing transmission of LBRF in 
      migrants from East Africa. Diagnosis of LBRF cases and prevention of autochthonous 
      transmission in asylum seeker camps are important steps for the near future.

TI  - Bartonella henselae infection in diverse clinical conditions in a tertiary care 
      hospital in north India.
PG  - 189-194
LID - 10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1932_16 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: : Bartonella henselae causes infections which closely 
      resemble febrile illness and chronic diseases such as tuberculosis and 
      haematological malignancies. There are not many studies on Bartonella infections 
      from India. The present study was undertaken to diagnose B. henselae infection in 
      diverse clinical conditions in a tertiary care hospital in north India. METHODS: A 
      total of 145 patients including those with fever and lymphadenopathy, infective 
      endocarditis and neuroretinitis were enrolled in the study. Whole blood, serum and 
      lymph node aspirate and valvular vegetations if available, were obtained. Samples 
      were plated on chocolate agar and brain-heart infusion agar containing five per cent 
      fresh rabbit blood and were incubated at 35°C for at least four weeks in five per 
      cent CO(2)with high humidity. Immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) was done for 
      the detection of IgM antibodies in the serum using a commercial kit. Whole blood was 
      used to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the citrate synthase gene 
      (gltA). RESULTS: IFA was positive in 11 of 140 (7.85%) patients and PCR was positive 
      in 3 of 140 (2.14%) patients. Culture was negative in all the cases. A higher 
      incidence of Bartonella infection was seen in patients with fever and 
      lymphadenopathy (n=30), seven of whom were children. In ophthalmological conditions, 
      four cases were IFA positive. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows 
      that the threat of Bartonella infection is a reality in India. It is also an 
      important treatable cause of fever and lymphadenopathy in children. Serology and PCR 
      are useful tests for its diagnosis. Clinicians should consider. BARTONELLA: 
      infection in the differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses and chronic diseases.

TI  - Comparative Diagnostic Utility of IS6110 PCR Assay in CSF and Peripheral Blood 
      Samples of Tuberculous Meningitis Patients: A Pilot Study from Central India.
PG  - BC13-BC17
LID - 10.7860/JCDR/2017/24493.9668 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of Central 
      Nervous System Tuberculosis (CNS-TB) and constitutes about 6% of all Extrapulmonary 
      TB (EPTB) cases. Most guidelines for the diagnosis and management of TBM agree on 
      the use of simple Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis using molecular tools like 
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). However, the sensitivity of PCR varies while using 
      a CSF sample. In the present study, we have compared the diagnostic utility of PCR 
      assay in both peripheral blood and CSF sample collected from TBM cases. AIM: To 
      evaluate the application of the peripheral blood PCR assay as an alternate tool for 
      TBM diagnosis compared to conventional CSF-PCR based system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      A total of 50 TBM patients were prospectively recruited from in patient department 
      wards of Central India Institute of Medical Sciences (CIIMS) between January 2014 - 
      Feburary 2015. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) specific IS6110 PCR and BactT liquid 
      culture were performed in 20 of recruited cases classified as Stage 1, 2 and 3 based 
      on British Medical Research Council (BMRC) contemporary clinical criteria for the 
      severity of TBM. Clinical characteristics were summarised in terms of percentages 
      for categorical variables, i.e., age groups, gender, signs and symptoms. All 
      statistical analysis was carried out using MedCalc software version 11.6. RESULTS: 
      Overall IS6110 PCR positivity in CSF was around 80% (16/20), which was higher than 
      culture (29.3%) and peripheral blood (39%). Out of 8 positive cases, stage wise 
      positivity of peripheral blood PCR assay in three TBM stages was 0% (stage1) 50% 
      (stage 2) and 67% (Stage 3) respectively. Positivity of peripheral blood PCR was 
      significantly more (86%) in patients with CSF culture/ IS6110 PCR positive for MTB 
      infection with sensitivity and specificity of 50 and 100% respectively. Increased 
      positivity rates of peripheral blood PCR was observed with decreased CSF/Blood sugar 
      ratio in stage 3 cases, suggesting enhanced probability of mycobacterial blood 
      dissemination in cases of TBM severity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that 
      although the molecular diagnosis of TBM infection in CSF remains the method of 
      choice, peripheral blood based PCR can be used as a good alternative to CSF in case 
      of TBM severity where the repeated CSF collection may be needed. However, study 
      demands further validation in large cohorts to justify the present hypothesis.

      patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)].
PG  - 475-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical characteristics and the diagnostic methods for 
      PCP in patients with AIDS. METHODS: Twelve cases of AIDS associated PCP confirmed by 
      sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were analyzed. RESULTS: Tuberculosis was 
      found in 4 cases and pneumonia in 1 case of PCP. Sputum PCR was positive in all the 
      12 cases, of them blood PCR was positive in 9, Gomori methenamine silver stain (GMS) 
      positive in 5 and Giemsa stain positive in 6 cases. The CD(4)(+) lymphocyte count 
      was (5 approximately 155) x 10(6)/L, with a mean of (51 +/- 48) x 10(6)/L; the 
      number of CD(4)(+) cells less than 100 x 10(6)/L in 10 cases (83%) with 9 cases 
      (75%) less than 50 x 10(6)/L. The CD(4)(+)/CD(8)(+) ratio was 0.01 approximately 
      0.29. CONCLUSIONS: PCP was common in patients with advanced AIDS and often 
      co-infected with other opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis. A diagnosis of 
      PCP should be considered if sputum PCR is positive and typical clinical 
      manifestations are present in patients with AIDS.

TI  - Evaluation of complementary diagnostic tools for bovine tuberculosis detection in 
      dairy herds from India.
PG  - 862-8
LID - 10.14202/vetworld.2016.862-868 [doi]
AB  - AIM: A cross-sectional study was undertaken to know the herd prevalence and evaluate 
      the single intradermal tuberculin testing (SITT), culture isolation, and polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) analysis for the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis (TB). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 541 cows of three dairy farms of Bareilly and 
      Mukteshwar were screened by SITT followed by collection of pre-scapular lymph node 
      (PSLN) aspirates (71), milk (54), and blood (71) samples from reactor animals. These 
      clinical samples were processed for culture isolation and direct PCR-based 
      identification and species differentiation. RESULTS: Out of 541 cows screened by 
      SITT, 71 (13.12%) animals were found positive. Mycobacteria were isolated from 3 
      (4.22%) PSLN aspirate but not from any cultured milk and blood samples. 28 (39.43%) 
      PSLN aspirate and 5 (9.25%) milk samples were positive for Mycobacterium TB (MTB) 
      complex (MTC) by PCR amplification for the IS6110 insertion sequence; however, blood 
      samples were found negative. For species differentiation, multiplex-PCR using 12.7 
      kb primers was conducted. Out of 28 PSLN aspirate, Mycobacterium bovis was detected 
      in 18 (64.28%) and MTB in 8 (28.57%), whereas 2 aspirate samples (7.14%) were 
      positive for both the species. All the five milk positive samples were positive for 
      M. bovis. CONCLUSION: Direct detection of bovine TB by a molecular-based method in 
      dairy animals after preliminary screening was appeared to be more sensitive and 
      specific compared to the conventional method (i.e., culture isolation). Its 
      application in form of serial testing methodology for the routine diagnosis and 
      thereafter, culling of infected stock may be suggested for the control programs in 
      dairy herds. The PSLN aspirate was found to be the most suitable specimen for 
      culture isolation and PCR-based detection of Mycobacterium spp. among live infected 
      animals.

TI  - Viral genomes in the pericardial fluid and in peri- and epicardial biopsies from a 
      German cohort of patients with large to moderate pericardial effusions.
PG  - 329-36
LID - 10.1007/s10741-013-9375-x [doi]
AB  - The aetiology of pericardial effusion has been generally assessed by clinical 
      work-up only, which leaves a large cohort of patients with "idiopathic" effusions 
      virtually undiagnosed. In accordance with the ESC guidelines, this contribution 
      intends to change this attitude. After therapeutic or diagnostic pericardiocentesis 
      of 259 patients with large to moderate pericardial effusions, pericardial fluid, 
      epicardial and pericardial biopsies, and blood samples were analysed by PCR for 
      cardiotropic microbial agents. Cytology, histology, immunohistology of tissue and 
      fluids and laboratory tests were performed. Of the 259 patients, 35 % suffered from 
      an autoreactive aetiology, 28 % suffered from a malignant and 14 % from an 
      infectious cause. Investigating all samples by PCR, we identified viral genomes in 
      51 (19.7 %) patients, parvovirus B19 (B19 V) being identified in 25 and Epstein-Barr 
      virus (EBV) in 19 cases. In patients with a sole infectious aetiology (n = 36), 
      B19 V was detected in 21 and EBV in 10 cases. When differentiating with regard to 
      the material investigated for the presence of cardiotropic viruses, parvovirus B19 
      was most often detected in the epicardium and EBV was most frequently detected in 
      the pericardial fluid independent from the final diagnostic categorisation. 
      Bacterial cultures including tests for tuberculosis were all negative. Molecular 
      techniques improve sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy for the 
      underlying aetiology in pericarditis patients with effusion. The identification of 
      specific viral signatures will help to understand pathogenetic mechanisms in 
      pericarditis and allow to tailor an adequate therapy beyond antiphlogistic 
      treatment.

TI  - Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in African adults infected with human 
      immunodeficient virus: double blind, randomized clinical trial of efficacy, 
      immunogenicity, and safety.
PG  - 128-37
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciq004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on the efficacy of trivalent, inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) 
      in HIV-infected adults, particularly in Africa, are limited. This study evaluated 
      the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of TIV in HIV-infected adults. METHODS: In 
      Johannesburg, South Africa, we undertook a randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial involving 506 HIV-infected adults. Subjects included 157 
      individuals who were antiretroviral treatment (ART) naive and 349 on stable-ART. 
      Participants were randomly assigned to receive TIV or normal saline intramuscularly. 
      Oropharyngeal swabs were obtained at illness visits during the influenza season and 
      tested by shell vial culture and RT PCR assay for influenza virus. Immune response 
      was evaluated by hemagglutinin antibody inhibition assay (HAI) in a nested cohort. 
      The primary study outcome involved vaccine efficacy against influenza confirmed 
      illness. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00757900. 
      RESULTS: The efficacy of TIV against confirmed influenza illness was 75.5% (95% CI: 
      9.2%-95.6%); with a risk difference of 0.18 per 100 person-weeks in TIV recipients. 
      Among TIV recipients, seroconversion, measured by HAI titers, was evident in 52.6% 
      for H1N1, 60.8% for H3N2, and 53.6% for influenza B virus. This compared with 2.2%, 
      2.2%, and 4.4% of placebo recipients (P < .0001). The frequency of local and 
      systemic adverse events post-immunization was similar between study groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: TIV immunization is safe and efficacious in African HIV-infected adults 
      without underlying co-morbidities. Further evaluation of effectiveness is warranted 
      in severely immunocompromized HIV-infected adults and those with co-morbidities such 
      as tuberculosis.

TI  - SYBR green-based detection of Leishmania infantum DNA using peripheral blood 
      samples.
PG  - 81-7
LID - 10.1007/s12639-014-0452-4 [doi]
AB  - Parasitological methods for the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) require 
      invasive sampling procedures. The aim of this study was to detect Leishmania 
      infantum (L. infantum) DNA by real time-PCR method in peripheral blood of 
      symptomatic VL patient and compared its performance with nested PCR, an established 
      molecular method with very high diagnostic indices. 47 parasitologically confirmed 
      VL patients diagnosed by direct agglutination test (DAT > 3200), bone marrow 
      aspiration and presented characteristic clinical features (fever, 
      hepatosplenomegaly, and anemia) and 40 controls (non-endemic healthy control-30, 
      Malaria-2, Toxoplasma gondii-2, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-2, HBV-1, HCV-1, HSV-1 
      and CMV-1) were enrolled in this study. SYBR-green based real time-PCR and nested 
      PCR was performed to amplify the Kinetoplast DNA minicircle gene using the DNA 
      extracted from Buffy coat. From among 47 patients, 45 (95.7 %) were positive by both 
      nested-PCR and real time-PCR. These results indicate that real time-PCR was not only 
      as sensitive as a nested-PCR assay for detection of Leishmania kDNA in clinical 
      sample, but also more rapid. The advantage of real time-PCR based methods over 
      nested-PCR is simple to perform, more faster in which nested-PCR requires post-PCR 
      processing and reducing contamination risk.

LID - 10.1186/1756-0500-4-332 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid amplification assays including PCR have revolutionized the 
      detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). Tuberculosis spread to almost every 
      organ of the body and is characterized on the basis of localization of infection. 
      Therefore, different types of body fluids and tissues can be used for the detection 
      of MTB.From 2004 to 2010 total 766 different types of smear negative samples from 
      patients, clinically suspected for tuberculosis were received and investigated at 
      Division of Molecular Diagnostics, University of the Punjab Lahore for the diagnosis 
      of tuberculosis. Mycobacterial DNA was extracted followed by PCR amplification. 
      FINDINGS: A total of 356 (46.5%) samples were found positive by PCR for MTB. These 
      included; serum (4.8%), blood (36.3%), urine (46.6%), cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) 
      (42.1%), ascetic fluid (67.6%), pleural fluid (52%), pericardial fluid (30%), pus 
      (38.6%), bone marrow (60%), sputum (38.8%) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (70%). 
      Over all there was no significant difference in males and females neither in 
      different age groups for the identification of MTB. CONCLUSION: We conclude that PCR 
      is a useful and sensitive tool for the early diagnosis of MTB in variety of clinical 
      samples.

TI  - A polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay based approach for 
      diagnosis and differentiation between vaccinated and infected cattle with 
      Mycobacterium bovis.
PG  - 115-21
LID - 10.4103/0975-7406.126584 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In most African and Arabic countries tuberculosis (TB) causes great 
      economic losses in bovine species and constitutes serious zoonotic problem. As the 
      traditional diagnostic method delay the research because of low sensitivity and 
      specificity, a rapid method of diagnosis is of outmost importance. AIM: The study 
      was designed to evaluate the two rapid diagnostic methods of TB in cattle, further 
      to differentiate between infected and bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinated 
      animals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intradermal tuberculin test was applied to 300 
      cattle. Of these cattle, 15 cattle were vaccinated from cattle negative to 
      tuberculin test with BCG. Blood samples were taken for lymphocyte separation to 
      apply polymerase chain reaction (PCR) upon and for serum preparation for the 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) application, this blood collected from 65 
      cattle classified into three groups, viz. positive tuberculin test (35 animals), 
      negative tuberculin test (15 animals), and vaccinated cow with BCG (15 animals). 
      From blood samples lymphocytes were separated and the isolated lymphocytes were 
      subjected to PCR and serum for ELISA application. Blood samples, specimens from 
      lymph nodes and specific tissues were taken for PCR and for cultivation and 
      isolation of Mycobacterium bovis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study 
      revealed that PCR can be used as rapid efficient and accurate diagnostic test in 
      detection of ruminant TB. Moreover, cattle's ELISA reading showed higher sensitivity 
      in positive tuberculin animals. However, the differentiations between vaccinated and 
      infected animals not clear by using a single antigen only.

TI  - [Acute respiratory failure in a 16-yr-old girl with alveolar soft part sarcoma].
PG  - 28-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive treatment in oncology often leads to severe complications, 
      including infection and coagulation disturbances. Among the most serious are fungal 
      infections which are often life-threatening, and difficult to recognize and treat. 
      We present a patient with severe pneumonia and pleural effusion, that developed 
      during treatment of a soft tissue sarcoma with pulmonary metastases. CASE REPORT: A 
      16-year-old girl was admitted to the ITU because of marked dyspnoea, bilateral 
      pneumonia and pleural effusion. She was intubated and placed on a ventilator, and 
      bilateral pleural drains were inserted. She also required vigorous inotropic support 
      (dopamine + noradrenaline). CRP was 12.5-19.8 mg dL(-1) and procalcitonin was below 
      1 ng mL(-1)). Lung metastases and tuberculosis were excluded and fungal infection 
      suspected. Aspergillus DNA was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage, and in blood 
      serum (PCR). Amphotericin B and voriconazole were instituted, but without evident 
      success, The girl was severely distressed, required mechanical ventilation with an 
      F1O2 of 0.6, while her CRP increased to 28.4 mg dL(-1). The amphotericin was stopped 
      and replaced with caspofungin, resulting in rapid improvement in her clinical 
      status. The girl was extubated after 21 days of ventilation, however due to a very 
      severe opioid withdrawal syndrome with extreme agitation, she was re-intubated. 
      After a further two weeks on methadone and sedatives, she was extubated again, this 
      time successfully, One month later she was discharged from the hospital, still on 
      oral voriconazole. CONCLUSION: Fungal infection should always be considered in 
      immunocompromised patients with clinical signs of systemic infection. Recognition 
      and treatment of pulmonary aspergillosis is difficult and may require multi drug 
      therapy.

AB  - Secondary pneumonia due to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) causes significant 
      morbidity and mortality. The aim of the research was designed a novel DNA vaccine 
      encoding the Mycobacterium tuberculosis secreted antigen Ag85A fused with the 
      influenza A virus (IAV) HA2 protein to provide protection against both influenza and 
      secondary infection with S. aureus. The DNA vaccine vector efficiently expressed the 
      encoded antigen in mammalian cells, as determined by RT-PCR, Western blotting and 
      immunofluorescence analysis. Mice were immunized with the vaccine by intramuscular 
      injection before challenge with IAV and S. aureus. The pulmonary and the splenocyte 
      culture IFN-γ levels were significant higher in immunized mice than their respective 
      controls. Although the antibody titer in the HI test was low, the sera of mice 
      immunized with the novel vaccine vector were effective in neutralisation assay in 
      vitro. The vaccine could reduce the loss of body weight in mice during IAV 
      challenge. Both Western blotting and RT-PCR showed that the vaccine markedly 
      enhanced toll like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression in splenocytes after the secondary 
      infection with S. aureus. The survival rate of mice with high TLR2 expression 
      (pEGFP/Ag85A-HA2 or iPR) was significantly increased compared with mice immunized 
      with pEGFP/HA2 after challenge with S. aureus. However, the pulmonary IL-10 
      concentration and S. aureus titer were significantly decreased in immunized mice, 
      and expression of TLR2 was increased after challenge with S. aureus. These results 
      demonstrated that Ag85A could strengthen the immune response to IAV and S. aureus, 
      and TLR2 was involved in the host response to S. aureus.

TI  - Cytomegalovirus pp65 antigenaemia as an indicator of end-organ disease in AIDS.
PG  - 545-7
AB  - We aim to assess the usefulness of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 antigenaemia test, 
      also called the CMV direct antigen test (DAT), in the management of patients with 
      advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; we studied all patients who 
      had pp65 assays between 8 September 1995 and 30 August 1996. Twenty-three patients 
      had 31 tests. The mean CD4 cell count was 20/mm3. The tests were negative in 16 
      patients, of whom 12 have not developed CMV end-organ disease after a mean follow up 
      of 114 days (range 14-269 days), whilst the remaining 4 patients had previously 
      treated CMV disease. Eleven patients had positive tests: 4 had active CMV disease, 2 
      subsequently developed CMV retinitis, 2 died within a fortnight of multi-drug 
      resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), one was lost to follow up and 2 have remained 
      disease-free. This test has a positive predictive value of 43% and a negative 
      predictive value of 94%, Fisher's exact test P=0.03. The pp65 antigenaemia assay can 
      be performed in a standard virology laboratory avoiding the problems associated with 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a result is available within 5 h, and it is 
      semi-quantifiable. However, a large prospective study is required to determine the 
      comparative value and roles of the pp65 antigenaemia assay and DNA PCR in the 
      management of CMV disease, especially with regard to the use of primary prophylaxis 
      and pre-emptive therapy.

TI  - Expression of two basic mRNA biomarkers in peripheral blood of patients with 
      non-small cell lung cancer detected by real-time rt-PCR, individually and 
      simultaneously.
PG  - 17-22
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although extensive research has been conducted on lung cancer markers, 
      a singular clinically applicable marker has not been found yet. The objective of 
      this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and the specificity of carcinoembryonic 
      antigen (CEA) mRNA and lung-specific X protein (LUNX) mRNA biomarkers in peripheral 
      blood to detect lung cancer individually and simultaneously. METHODS: Thirty 
      patients affected by lung cancer and 30 healthy individuals were studied in this 
      research. Three vials of cDNA were made from each sample after taking peripheral 
      blood samples and extracting total RNA. Each sample was examined by the real-time 
      RT-PCR technique. The result from each vial was then compared with the sensitivity 
      of overall marker. RESULTS: The CEA mRNA was positive in 24 out of 30 lung cancer 
      patients. Hence, its sensitivity was determined at 80%, differing significantly from 
      that observed in healthy individuals, where 11 positive cases were seen. The overall 
      sensitivity of this marker was significantly associated with positivity in vials 2 
      and 3 but not in vial 1. The LUNX mRNA was positive in 21 out of 30 patients, 
      indicating 70% sensitivity. This finding significantly differed from that in healthy 
      individuals. The overall sensitivity of this marker was significantly associated 
      with positivity in vials 1 and 3, but not in vial 2. In 93.3% of the patients, at 
      least one positive marker was observed. CONCLUSION: The mentioned mRNA could be 
      suggested as sensitive and specific markers in peripheral blood for primary 
      diagnosis of lung cancer.

TI  - SiRNA/DOX lodeded chitosan based nanoparticles: Development, Characterization and in 
      vitro evaluation on A549 lung cancer cell line.
PG  - 87-94
AB  - High-mobility group AT-hook2 (HMGA2), involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT) process, has a pivotal role in lung cancer metastasis. Lung cancer therapy 
      with HMGA2 suppressing small interfering RNA (siRNA) has been introduced recently 
      while doxorubicin (DOX) has been used as a frequent cancer chemotherapy agent. Both 
      reagents have been faced with obstacles in clinic which make them ineffective. 
      NanoParticles (NPs) provided a platform for efficient co delivery of the anticancer 
      drugs. The aim of this study was production and in vitro characterization of 
      different pharmacological groups (siRNA, DOX or siRNA-DOX) of carboxymethyl dextran 
      thrimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (CMDTMChiNPs) on cytotoxicity, gene expression, 
      apoptosis and migration of metastatic lung cancer cell line (A-549). CMDTMChiNPs 
      were synthesized and encapsulated with siRNA, DOX or siRNA-DOX. Then the effects of 
      HMGA2 siRNA and DOX co delivery was assessed in A549 viability and target genes 
      (HMGA2, Ecadherin, vimentin and MMP9) by MTT and real time PCR, respectively. In 
      addition capability of apoptosis induction and anti-migratory features of formulated 
      NPs were analyzed by flowcytometry and wound healing assays. SiRNA-DOX-CMDTM ChiNPs 
      approximate size were 207±5 with poly dispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of 
      0.4 and 16.3±0.3, respectively. NPs loaded with DOX and siRNA were the most 
      efficient drug formulations in A549 cell cytotoxicity, altering of EMT markers, 
      apoptosis induction and migration inhibition. Generally our results showed that co 
      delivery of HMGA2 siRNA and DOX by novel designed CMDTMChiNPs is a new therapeutic 
      approach with great potential efficiency for lung cancer treatment.

TI  - [Is molecular biology useful to the practitioner?].
PG  - 554-60
AB  - The relative importance of molecular biology in clinical practice is often 
      underestimated. However, numerous procedures in clinical diagnosis and new 
      therapeutic drugs have resulted from basic molecular research. Furthermore, 
      understanding of the physiological and physiopathological mechanisms underlying 
      several human diseases has been improved by the results of basic molecular research. 
      For example, cloning of the gene encoding leptin has provided spectacular insights 
      into the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the control of food intake and 
      body weight maintenance in man. In cystic fibrosis, the cloning and identification 
      of several mutations in the gene encoding the chloride channel transmembrane 
      regulator (CFTR) have resolved several important issues in clinical practice: cystic 
      fibrosis constitutes a molecular defect of a single gene. There is a strong 
      correlation between the clinical manifestations or the severity of the disease 
      (phenotype) with the type of mutations present in the CFTR gene (genotype). More 
      recently, identification of mutations in the gene encoding a subunit of the renal 
      sodium channel in the Liddle syndrome has provided important insight into the 
      physiopathological understanding of mechanisms involved in this form of hereditary 
      hypertension. Salt retention and secondary high blood pressure are the result of 
      constitutive activation of the renal sodium channel by mutations in the gene 
      encoding the renal sodium channel. It is speculated that less severe mutations in 
      this channel could result in a less severe form of hypertension which may correspond 
      to patients suffering from high blood pressure with low plasma renin activity. 
      Several tools, most notably PCR, are derived from molecular research and are used in 
      everyday practice, i.e. in prenatal diagnosis and in the diagnosis of several 
      infectious diseases including tuberculosis and hepatitis. Finally, the production of 
      recombinant proteins at lower cost and with fewer side effects is used in everyday 
      clinical practice. Gene therapy remains an extraordinary challenge in correcting 
      severe hereditary or acquired diseases. The use of genetically modified animal cell 
      lines producing growth factors, insulin or erythropoetin, which are subsequently 
      encapsulated and transferred to man, represents an attractive approach for gene 
      therapy.

TI  - Irgm1 protects hematopoietic stem cells by negative regulation of IFN signaling.
PG  - 1525-33
LID - 10.1182/blood-2011-01-328682 [doi]
AB  - The IFN-inducible immunity-related p47 GTPase Irgm1 has been linked to Crohn disease 
      as well as susceptibility to tuberculosis. Previously we demonstrated that HSC 
      quiescence and function are aberrant in mice lacking Irgm1. To investigate the 
      molecular basis for these defects, we conducted microarray expression profiling of 
      Irgm1-deficient HSCs. Cell-cycle and IFN-response genes are up-regulated in 
      Irgm1(-/-) HSCs, consistent with dysregulated IFN signaling. To test the hypothesis 
      that Irgm1 normally down-regulates IFN signaling in HSCs, we generated 
      Irgm1(-/-)Ifngr1(-/-) and Irgm1(-/-)Stat1(-/-) double-knockout animals. Strikingly, 
      hyperproliferation, self-renewal, and autophagy defects in Irgm1(-/-) HSCs were 
      normalized in double-knockout animals. These defects were also abolished in 
      Irgm1(-/-)Irgm3(-/-) double-knockout animals, indicating that Irgm1 may regulate 
      Irgm3 activity. Furthermore, the number of HSCs was reduced in aged Irgm1(-/-) 
      animals, suggesting that negative feedback inhibition of IFN signaling by Irgm1 is 
      necessary to prevent hyperproliferation and depletion of the stem cell compartment. 
      Collectively, our results indicate that Irgm1 is a powerful negative regulator of 
      IFN-dependent stimulation in HSCs, with an essential role in preserving HSC number 
      and function. The deleterious effects of excessive IFN signaling may explain how 
      hematologic abnormalities arise in patients with inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Study of Surgical Emergencies of Tubercular Abdomen in Developing Countries.
PG  - 182-5
LID - 10.1007/s12262-012-0755-6 [doi]
AB  - To study the various modes of presentation, diagnosis, and management of surgical 
      emergencies of tubercular abdomen. This prospective study of surgical emergencies of 
      tubercular abdomen was conducted in 50 patients who attended our surgical emergency 
      from 2006 to 2008. Patients were evaluated thoroughly with history, physical 
      examination, routine investigations, and special investigations such as ELISA, PCR, 
      barium studies of gastrointestinal tract, and diagnostic laparoscopy as required and 
      managed with medical and surgical treatment as necessary. The most of patients were 
      from rural areas, in the third to sixth decades with slight male preponderance. 
      Abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation were commonest presenting symptoms. About 
      20 % patients had history of pulmonary tuberculosis and 16 % patients presented with 
      ascites. PCR for blood and ascitic fluid was positive in 72 and 87.5 % patients, 
      respectively. About 24 % patients were managed nonoperatively and responded to ATT. 
      About 76 % patients needed surgery among which one-fifth of patients were operated 
      in emergency. Procedures like adhesiolysis of gut (47.3 %), strictureplasty 
      (10.5 %), resection anastomosis (5.2 %), right hemicolectomy (5.2 %), and 
      ileotransverse anastomosis (7.8 %) were performed in 30 patients and peritoneal 
      biopsy and lymph node biopsy in the remaining 8 patients. Both medically and 
      surgically managed patients were put on antitubercular therapy. Abdominal 
      tuberculosis is a disease of middle-aged rural people, presenting commonly with 
      abdominal pain and vomiting with right lower abdominal tenderness. PCR (blood and 
      ascites) for tuberculosis is much more sensitive than IgM ELISA (blood and ascites). 
      The most of patients required surgical procedures and all patients responded 
      dramatically to antitubercular therapy symptomatically with increase in the 
      hemoglobin level and decrease in ESR.

TI  - Newer trends in tubercular uveitis: a case series with systemic correlation.
PG  - 1739-1744
LID - 10.18240/ijo.2020.11.09 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To determine the spectrum of uveitis, causes of visual loss in systemic 
      tuberculosis (TB), role of investigations and outcome after anti-TB therapy (ATT). 
      METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 250 patients with systemic TB at a 
      referral center in Chennai, South India from April 2016 to May 2019. Systemic workup 
      comprised of Mantoux, chest X-ray, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and QuantiFERON 
      (QFT) TB Gold. Aqueous humor analysis by nested PCR or real time PCR (RT-PCR) and 
      ancillary ophthalmic investigations such as fundus fluorescein angiography, optical 
      coherence tomography were performed. RESULTS: Multifocal choroiditis and vasculitis 
      were the most common manifestations (39% and 24% respectively) together accounting 
      for 61% of cases and they had a higher risk of recurrence (3%). Pulmonary 
      tuberculosis (PTB) was more frequently associated with uveitis (18%). Among those 
      with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), uveitis occured in miliary TB (2%), bone 
      (1%) and abdominal TB (1%). Complications such as cystoid macular edema, choroidal 
      neovascular membranes and macular scarring caused visual loss. Aqueous humor 
      analysis detected mycobacterium TB antigen. Collectively, systemic investigations 
      such as chest X-ray, Mantoux test and those performed on blood samples such as PCR 
      and QFT were positive in 39% of patients. In inconclusive patients, nested PCR 
      and/or RT-PCR were done on aqueous humor samples and were diagnostic in 96%. A 
      combination of tests was diagnostic in 92%. ATT in isolation in 71% and combined 
      with corticosteroids in 29% was used for treatment of which signs of resolution and 
      improvement in vision started as early as 6wk in those who were started immediately 
      on corticosteroids and ATT and longer than 3mo in those on ATT alone. Prompt 
      treatment with ATT and corticosteroids improved vision in 23% of our patients within 
      2mo. Vitritis with choroiditis causes cystoid macular oedema and requires longer 
      duration of ATT. Vision improved in 69%. Complete resolution occurred in 75% and 
      worsening in 12%. CONCLUSION: A combination of investigations guided by clinical 
      suspicion helps in precise diagnosis. In diagnostic dilemmas analysis of ocular 
      samples is reliable and confirmatory. Screening all patients and a multidisciplinary 
      approach in TB (active, healed or during treatment) is recommended.

AB  - Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) is a major mechanism of protection 
      against viral infections in vivo. Identification of HIV-1-specific monoclonal 
      antibodies (mAbs) with potent ADCC activity may help develop an effective HIV-1 
      vaccine. In present study, we isolated such human mAb, designated E10, from an 
      HIV-1-infected patient sample by single B cell sorting and single cell PCR. E10 
      bound to gp140 trimer and linear peptides derived from gp41 membrane proximal 
      external region (MPER). E10 epitope (QEKNEQELLEL) overlapped with mAb 2F5 epitope. 
      However, E10 differentiated from 2F5 in neutralization breadth and potency, as well 
      as ADCC activity. E10 showed low neutralization activity and narrow spectrum of 
      neutralization compared to 2F5, but it mediated higher ADCC activity than 2F5 at low 
      antibody concentration. Fine mapping of E10 epitope may potentiate MPER-based 
      subunit vaccine development.

TI  - ACS in children with sickle cell anaemia in Uganda: prevalence, presentation and 
      aetiology.
PG  - 289-297
LID - 10.1111/bjh.15543 [doi]
AB  - ACS (ACS) is a serious complication of sickle cell anaemia (SCA). We set out to 
      describe the burden, presentation and organisms associated with ACS amongst children 
      with SCA attending Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. In a cross-sectional study, 256 
      children with SCA and fever attending Mulago Hospital were recruited. Chest X-rays, 
      blood cultures, complete blood count and sputum induction were performed. Sputum 
      samples were investigated by Ziehl-Nielsen staining, culture and DNA polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) for Chlamydia pneumoniae. Of the 256 children, 22·7% had ACS. 
      Clinical and laboratory findings were not significantly different between children 
      with ACS and those without, besides cough and abnormal signs on auscultation. Among 
      the 83 sputum cultures Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%) and Moraxella spp (8%), were 
      the commonest. Of the 59 sputa examined with DNA PCR, 59·3% were positive for 
      Chlamydia pneumoniae. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was isolated in 6/83 sputa. These 
      results show that one in 5 SCA febrile children had ACS. There were no clinical and 
      laboratory characteristics of ACS, but cough and abnormalities on auscultation were 
      associated with ACS. The high prevalence of Chlamydia pneumoniae in children with 
      ACS in this setting warrants the addition of macrolides to treatment, and 
      M. tuberculosis should be differential in sub-Saharan children with ACS.

      6-Month Survival.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: miRNAs contribute to a variety of essential biological processes 
      including development, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Circulating 
      microRNAs are very stable and have shown potential as biomarkers of cardiovascular 
      disease. microRNA-208b expression was increased in the blood of patients with acute 
      myocardial infarction (AMI) and has been proposed as a biomarker for early 
      diagnosis. In this pilot study, we investigate the potential of circulating miR-208b 
      as a prognostic biomarker of 6-month survival in AMI patients. METHODS: Plasma 
      samples from 21 patients and 8 age- and gender-matched healthy adults were 
      collected, and circulating levels of miR-208b were detected using quantitative 
      real-time PCR. RESULTS: miR-208b levels were higher in healthy control subjects 
      (9.6-fold; P ≤ 0.05). Within the AMI patients, the levels of miR-208b were 
      significantly lower in the survivor versus nonsurvivor group (fold change = 6.51 and 
      14.1, resp.; P ≤ 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier curve revealed that the 6-month survival 
      time was significantly higher among AMI patients with a relative expression of 
      miR-208b lower than 12.38. The hazard ratio (HR) for the relative expression of 
      miR-208b (<12.38 was the reference) was 5.08 (95% CI: 1.13-22.82; P = 0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: Our results showed that elevated miR-208b expression was associated with 
      reduced long-term survival in AMI patients. These pilot data indicate the need for a 
      large follow-up study to confirm whether miR-208b can be used as a predictor of 
      6-month survival time after AMI.

TI  - Prognostic value of rare and complex mutations in EGFR and serum levels of soluble 
      EGFR and its ligands in non-small cell lung carcinoma patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of complex and rare mutations in epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR) gene have been identified and the clinical implication of serum EGFR 
      ligands has also been reported. However, the prognostic significance of these 
      mutations and also the serum EGFR and its ligands in Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma 
      (NSCLC) has remained a challenging issue. This study is aimed at finding the 
      prognostic importance of EGFR rare mutations and serum EGFR, amphiregulin (AR), and 
      TGF-α (Transforming Growth Factor-alpha) in NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHOD: NSCLC 
      patients (n=98) with mean age of 59±10.5 were enrolled (M/F: 75/23). DNA was 
      extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues. Exons 19 and 21 were 
      amplified using polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing for 
      identification of mutations. Serum EGFR, AR, and TGF-α were measured by ELISA. 
      RESULTS: EGFR mutation rate in patients was 37% (exon 19 deletions: 72.2%, exon 21 
      substitutions: 27.8%). The E872K in exon 21 mutation-positive cases was the most 
      frequent rare mutation detected (90%; 9/10 samples). A significant relationship was 
      found between EGFR exon 21mutations and serum EGFR and TGF-α (P<0.05). Increased 
      serum AR (>3pg/ml) and TGF-α (>10.5pg/ml) were associated with shorter overall 
      survival (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The data clearly show that elevation of serum TGF-α 
      and AR are associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC. In addition to the close 
      relationship between EGFR mutations and serum EGFR, serum TGF-α changes was 
      associated with the gene mutations. These findings could be implicated in clinical 
      decision making related to EGFR-TKIs.

TI  - Utility of Treponemal Testing from Aqueous Fluid in the Diagnosis of Ocular Syphilis 
      in Patients with HIV/AIDS.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1080/09273948.2020.1803362 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Ocular syphilis is re-emerging globally especially in patients with human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Atypical manifestations of ocular syphilis and/or 
      other associated opportunistic infections often lead to a diagnostic dilemma. We 
      evaluated the utility of aqueous humor (AH) Treponema pallidum hemagglutination 
      assay (TPHA) titers in the diagnosis of ocular syphilis. Methods: Retrospective case 
      series of five HIV positive patients with positive syphilis serology in whom AH 
      sampling was performed. All patients had ocular manifestations suspicious of 
      infectious etiology. Results: Panuveitis with/without retinitis was the commonest 
      presentation. Along with blood investigations, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      testing from AH was done for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), Herpes Simplex Virus 
      (HSV), Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Toxoplasma gondii. 
      In addition, serum antibody titers for Toxoplasma, rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and 
      TPHA tests for syphilis were done. In patients with raised serum RPR/TPHA, aqueous 
      TPHA titers were also assessed. Mean serum RPR titer was ≥ 1:32 and TPHA titer was 
      ≥1:1280. Aqueous humor titers of TPHA was high in all patients (range ≥ 1:320 to 
      ≥1:5120). Aqueous PCR was negative for all other infectious etiologies in four 
      patients. In one patient, PCR-CMV was also positive, suggestive of a dual infection. 
      Post-treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and appropriate 
      anti-syphilitic regime, complete resolution of lesions with corresponding fall in 
      the serum RPR/TPHA titers were noted in all patients. Conclusions: Ocular syphilis 
      with atypical presentations is usually diagnosed based on a positive syphilis 
      serology and by excluding other infectious causes. In the present study, we have 
      shown an excellent correlation between raised AH TPHA titers with serological values 
      and the clinical presentation. Considering the ease of collection of AH in contrast 
      to vitreous fluids, the AH-TPHA assay could potentially be a valuable tool in the 
      diagnosis of ocular syphilis.

TI  - Keratin-18 and microRNA-122 complement alanine aminotransferase as novel safety 
      biomarkers for drug-induced liver injury in two human cohorts.
PG  - 367-78
LID - 10.1111/liv.12322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: There is a demand for more sensitive, specific and predictive 
      biomarkers for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) than the gold standard used today, 
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT). The aim of this study was to qualify novel DILI 
      biomarkers (keratin-18 markers M65/M30, microRNA-122, glutamate dehydrogenase and 
      alpha-foetoprotein) in human DILI. METHODS: Levels of the novel biomarkers were 
      measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or real-time quantitative 
      reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in two human DILI cohorts: a human volunteer 
      study with acetaminophen and a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/tuberculosis (TB) 
      study. RESULTS: In the acetaminophen study, serum M65 and microRNA-122 levels were 
      significantly increased at an earlier time point than ALT. Furthermore, the maximal 
      elevation of M65 and microRNA-122 exceeded the increase in ALT. In the HIV/TB study, 
      all the analysed novel biomarkers increased after 1 week of treatment. In contrast 
      to ALT, the novel biomarkers remained stable in a human cohort with exercise-induced 
      muscular injury. CONCLUSIONS: M65 and microRNA-122 are potential biomarkers of DILI 
      superior to ALT with respect to sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - Bottlenecks and opportunities for delivering integrated pediatric HIV services in 
      Nepal.
PG  - S21-9
LID - 10.1097/COH.0000000000000262 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In children, integration of HIV in MNCH services has been shown to incr. 
      ease uptake of early infant diagnosis. This article examines bottlenecks and 
      opportunities for scaling up integrated pediatric HIV services in Nepal. METHODS: 
      This is a descriptive study using both mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, 
      conducted in January 2015 in 19 facilities in five regions of Nepal most affected by 
      HIV epidemic. The qualitative methods comprised in-depth structured interviews with 
      key informants (leadership of The National Center for AIDS and STD Control and 
      National Public Health Laboratory, district management teams, medical officers in 
      charge of health facilities and HIV clinics, frontline staff at antenatal care and 
      HIV clinics and laboratory). The quantitative methods were used to abstract data of 
      HIV-infected pregnant women seen between January and December 2014, HIV-exposed 
      infants aged less than 12 months, and HIV infected children aged less than 15 years 
      who were initiated HIV treatment from 2010 to 2014. Structured tools were used to 
      collect data which were analysed using IBM SPSS. RESULTS: Of the 19 facilities 
      assessed, 18(98%), 18(98%), 14(75%), and 11(58%) provided prevention of 
      mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), 
      pediatric ART and nutrition rehabilitation services, respectively. However, only 
      1(5%) facility collected onsite dried blood spots (DBS) for PCR HIV testing and 
      6(32%) facilities provided counselling and referral for DBS. In 2014, of the 121 
      HIV-exposed infants recorded, only 21(17%) received PCR test. The median turnaround 
      time of the PCR test results was 54 days. Of the 21 records with PCR test, 11(52.5%) 
      were from PMTCT clinics, 7(33%) from Nutritional rehabilitation clinics, and 
      3(14.5%) from pediatric outpatient clinic.Conversely, 934 children were initiated 
      ART between 2010 and 2014, of which 5% were infants and 29% aged between 1 and 5 
      years. 298(32%) had comorbidities of which 64% had malnutrition. A total of 534(57%) 
      had tuberculosis (TB) status assessed of which 58(11%) had active TB. Infants had 
      lowest retention (63%), high mortality (17.4%), and loss to follow-up (10.9%). 
      CONCLUSION: Few facilities collect DBS and few children receive PCR tests with 
      limited linkage to ART. This has led to late ART initiation, comorbidities, 
      including TB coinfections and poor outcomes. The results indicate that there are 
      opportunities for improving HIV case finding among HIV-exposed infants in PMTCT, 
      EPI, TB, and nutrition services if provider initiated testing and counselling at the 
      point of service delivery is institutionalized in these settings.

      Recipient.
PG  - 169-172
AB  - A 35- year- old man with a prior history of liver transplantation 18 months ago was 
      admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with fever and worsening dyspnea and was 
      diagnosed with severe pneumonia leading to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome 
      (ARDS). He had a prolonged hospitalization and was treated with empiric broad 
      spectrum intravenous antibiotics, oseltamivir, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and 
      subsequently caspofungin and ganciclovir. Blood, nasopharyngeal, as well as 
      Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were 
      negative for all viral, bacterial, and fungal causes of pulmonary infection except 
      Enterovirus-Human Rhinovirus (EV-HRV) that was positive with high titers on BAL and 
      swab specimens. Consequently, the diagnosis of EV-HRV pneumonia complicated by ARDS 
      was established. The patient gradually improved and was discharged from the hospital 
      after 3 weeks. This report highlights EV-HRV as a cause of ARDS in immunocompromised 
      adults.

TI  - Diagnostic value of PCR in genitourinary tuberculosis.
PG  - 305-8
LID - 10.1007/s12291-012-0279-7 [doi]
AB  - Genitourinary tuberculosis is a disease of the genitourinary system which includes 
      the entire urinary tract and reproductive system. Genital tuberculosis is an 
      important cause of female infertility, especially in developing nations like India. 
      In the present study, a total of 257 clinical specimens comprising of endometrial 
      biopsy (109), endometrial curetting (42), menstrual blood (8), semen (17), placenta 
      (11) and urine (70) were collected from patients and subjected for PCR, Culture and 
      AFB detection. The endometrial biopsy, endometrial curetting, menstrual blood, 
      semen, placenta, urine showed 30.2, 45.2,12.5, 5.8, 27.2, 31.4 %, positivity rate 
      for tuberculosis by PCR, 7.3, 9.5, 25.0, 0, 9, 8.5 % by culture and 1.8, 2.3, 0, 0, 
      0, 2.8 % respectively by AFB smear. Being a novel, rapid technique, PCR is the 
      method of choice for rapid diagnosis and management of genitourinary tuberculosis 
      shared with the other concerned tests. This study reveals that genital tuberculosis 
      can occur in any age group, however, the majority of patients were from reproductive 
      age (nearly 75 % of them were from 20-45 years of age) group.

TI  - Autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein astrocytopathy manifesting as subacute 
      meningoencephalitis with descending myelitis: a case report.
PG  - 443
LID - 10.1186/s12883-020-02021-7 [doi]
LID - 443
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) autoimmune astrocytopathy is 
      characterized by GFAP autoantibody positive encephalitis, meningoencephalitis or 
      meningoencephalomyelitis. The initial clinical presentation may be similar to 
      central nervous system infections making early diagnosis challenging. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A Chinese female patient presented with subacute meningitis with 
      symptoms of headache, vomiting, and fever. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 
      monocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein level, low glucose level, and negative basic 
      microbiological studies including Xpert MTB/RIF. Brain magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) showed bilateral cerebral cortical and white matter hyperintensities on FLAIR 
      sequences. The patient was diagnosed with possible tuberculous meningitis and 
      started on anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT). Three months later, the patient 
      developed cervical myelopathy and encephalopathy with persistent CSF pleocytosis. 
      Five months later, tissue-based and cell-based assays demonstrated GFAP antibodies 
      in blood and CSF. Her symptoms improved with repeated administration of intravenous 
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids. One-and-a-half -year follow-up showed 
      neither clinical progression nor relapses. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-GFAP astrocytopathy 
      should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with 
      subacute meningitis with negative microbiological studies and a progressive clinical 
      course including encephalitis and/or myelitis.

AB  - Background: Tuberculin skin test and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) show 
      limitations in diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and poorly predict 
      progression to active tuberculosis. This study will explore detection of 
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb) DNA in CD34 (+) peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs) as a biomarker for LTBI and monitoring chemoprophylaxis response. 
      Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 120 household contacts (60 HIV positive and 60 
      HIV negative) will be recruited. Also, 10 patients with sputum positive pulmonary 
      tuberculosis and 10 visitors from low incidence countries with no history of TB 
      treatment will be recruited as positive and negative controls, respectively. 
      Participants will donate 100 ml (50 ml for TB patients) of blood to isolate PBMCs 
      using density gradient centrifugation. Isolated PBMCs will be separated into CD34 
      (+) and CD34 (-) enriched cellular fractions. DNA from each fraction will be 
      purified, quantified and subjected to droplet digital PCR targeting IS6110 (a M.tb 
      Complex multi-copy gene) and rpoB, a single copy gene. Also, 4 ml of blood will be 
      drawn for IGRA. In a nested prospective study, 60 HIV positive participants will be 
      given 300 mg of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) daily for six months, after which 
      they will donate a second 100 ml blood sample that will be processed as described 
      above. Data from the cross-sectional study will be analysed to determine the 
      proportion of individuals in whom M.tb DNA is detectable in CD34 (+) and CD34 (-) 
      fractions and number of M.tb genomes present. Data from the prospective study will 
      be analysed to compare the proportion of individuals with detectable M.tb DNA in 
      CD34 (+) and CD34 (-) fractions, and median M.tb genome copy number, post vs 
      pre-IPT. Discussion: This study will determine whether detection of M.tb DNA in CD34 
      (+) PBMCs holds promise as a biomarker for LTBI and monitoring chemoprophylaxis 
      response.

      description of Mycobacterium boenickei sp. nov., Mycobacterium houstonense sp. nov., 
      Mycobacterium neworleansense sp. nov. and Mycobacterium brisbanense sp. nov. and 
      recognition of Mycobacterium porcinum from human clinical isolates.

AB  - The Mycobacterium fortuitum third biovariant complex (sorbitol-negative and 
      sorbitol-positive) contains unnamed taxa first characterized in 1991. These 
      organisms can cause respiratory infections, a spectrum of soft tissue and skeletal 
      infections, bacteraemia and disseminated disease. To evaluate this group of 
      organisms, clinical reference isolates and the type strains of M. fortuitum third 
      biovariant complex sorbitol-negative (n = 21), M. fortuitum third biovariant complex 
      sorbitol-positive (n = 3), M. fortuitum (n = 3), Mycobacterium peregrinum (pipemidic 
      acid-susceptible) (n = 1), Mycobacterium porcinum (n = 1), Mycobacterium senegalense 
      (n = 2) and Mycobacterium septicum (n = 1) were characterized by using conventional 
      phenotypic (morphological, physiological and antimicrobial susceptibilities), 
      chemotaxonomic (HPLC and cellular fatty acids) and genotypic [RFLP of the rRNA gene 
      (ribotyping), PCR-RFLP of a 439 bp segment of the 65 kDa hsp gene (PCR restriction 
      analysis) and 16S rRNA gene sequence] analysis, DNA G + C content and DNA-DNA 
      relatedness analyses. The results of these studies indicated that the strains 
      comprised M. porcinum (n = 13), M. septicum (n = 1) and four novel closely related 
      genetic groups within the M. fortuitum third biovariant complex: Mycobacterium 
      boenickei sp. nov. (n = 6), Mycobacterium houstonense sp. nov. (n = 2), 
      Mycobacterium neworleansense sp. nov. (n = 1) and Mycobacterium brisbanense sp. nov. 
      (n = 1), with type strains ATCC 49935T (= W5998T = DSM 44677T), ATCC 49403T (= 
      W5198T = DSM 44676T) ATCC 49404T (= W6705T = DSM 44679T) and ATCC 49938T (= W6743T = 
      DSM 44680T), respectively.

PG  - 519-22
AB  - We report a case of lung infection due to Mycobacterium abscessus (M. abscessus), 
      complicated with primary macroamylasemia. A 76-year-old man was admitted to our 
      hospital in August 2002 because of bloody sputum and an abnormal shadow found on 
      chest radiography. The patient had had pulmonary tuberculosis from 1998 to 2000. He 
      was found to be antacid bacillus-positive (Gaffky 5) on examination of the sputum in 
      August 2002, but after hospitalization was negative for tuberculosis bacillus on 
      sputum examination by the PCR method. We had suspected the presence of 
      non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease since the patient's admission, and had started 
      a regime of three drugs: clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol. The bacteria 
      were identified as M. abscessus in a later sputum culture examination. It was 
      noticed that the blood amylase level was high, and the disease was diagnosed as 
      primary macroamylasemia. Such a case of lung infection due to M. abscessus 
      complicated with macroamylasemia has rarely been reported in Japan.

AB  - A 35-year-old African American woman with HIV/AIDS presented with altered mental 
      status. A CT of the head revealed an infiltrating hypodense intra-axial mass within 
      the basal forebrain. Lumbar puncture showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated 
      protein and low glucose. PCR analysis of the CSF was negative for Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis, HSV, VZV, CMV and JC virus. There was low positivity for EBV DNA. 
      Serologic studies were consistent with past infections with EBV and CMV and were 
      negative for toxoplasmosis, histoplasmosis, Cryptococcus and West Nile virus. VDRL 
      was non-reactive. CSF and blood cultures were negative. She soon expired. 
      Post-mortem examination of the patient's brain showed a poorly delineated area of 
      softening and hemorrhage within the basal forebrain. Histologic examination revealed 
      necrotizing encephalitis with perivascular lymphocytes and glial cells with numerous 
      cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions. Immunohistochemistry was strongly positive 
      for adenovirus and negative for HSV, CMV, SV40 and EBV. Electron microscopy 
      confirmed the presence virions consistent with adenovirus. We conclude that 
      adenovirus is a rare and sometimes unsuspected cause of encephalitis that may 
      present as a forebrain mass lesion.

TI  - Pulmonary langerhans cell histiocytosis - insight into the incidence of 
      alfa-1-antitrypsin (A1ATD) deficiency alleles.
PG  - 297-300
LID - 10.5603/ARM.2017.0051 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1ATD) is one of the three most 
      common genetic disorders in Caucasians. It considerably increases the risk of 
      progressive obstructive lung diseases, mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
      There is no data regarding prevalence of main, clinically most important A1ATD 
      alleles PI*Z and PI*S in patients with pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis 
      (PLCH). PLCH is not only strongly linked to the cigarette smoking, but is also 
      characterised by polycystic lung lesions. The goal of the study was to assess the 
      incidence of A1ATD alleles in patients with PLCH. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood 
      samples were collected from 34 adult patients (14 women and 20 men), with 
      histologically confirmed PLCH. AAT serum concentration was assessed by nephelometry 
      and PI-phenotype, identified by isoelectrofocusing. The PI*S and PI*Z alleles were 
      confirmed by genotyping usisng real-time PCR. RESULTS: Deficiency alleles PI*Z and 
      PI*S were detected in 3 patients (one woman and 2 men), respectively in 5.88% and 
      2.94%. The estimated incidence of deficiency alleles was 29.4/1000 (95% CI; 10-69.5) 
      for PI*Z and 14.7/1000(95%CI; 13.9-43.3) for PI*S. According to our previous 
      reports, the expected prevalence of PI*Z and PI*S alleles in general Polish 
      population was 13.7/1000 (95% CI 5.8-21.5), and 7,6/1000 (95% CI 1.7-13.5) 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of main A1AT deficiency alleles in patients 
      with PLCH seems higher than in general Polish population. The study is on-going.

      antimicrobial response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis by enhancing autophagy.

AB  - Apoptosis inhibitor of macrophages (AIM), a scavenger protein secreted by tissue 
      macrophages, is transcriptionally regulated by the nuclear receptor Liver X Receptor 
      (LXR) and Retinoid X Receptor (RXR) heterodimer. Given that LXR exerts a protective 
      immune response against M. tuberculosis, here we analyzed whether AIM is involved in 
      this response. In an experimental murine model of tuberculosis, AIM serum levels 
      peaked dramatically early after infection with M. tuberculosis, providing an in vivo 
      biological link to the disease. We therefore studied the participation of AIM in 
      macrophage response to M. tuberculosis in vitro. For this purpose, we used the H37Rv 
      strain to infect THP-1 macrophages transfected to stably express AIM, thereby 
      increasing infected macrophage survival. Furthermore, the expression of this protein 
      enlarged foam cell formation by enhancing intracellular lipid content. Phagocytosis 
      assays with FITC-labeled M. tuberculosis bacilli indicated that this protein was not 
      involved in bacterial uptake; however, AIM expression decreased the number of 
      intracellular cfus by up to 70% in bacterial killing assays, suggesting that AIM 
      enhances macrophage mycobactericidal activity. Accordingly, M. tuberculosis-infected 
      AIM-expressing cells upregulated the production of reactive oxygen species. 
      Moreover, real-time PCR analysis showed increased mRNA levels of the antimicrobial 
      peptides cathelicidin and defensin 4B. These increases were concomitant with greater 
      cellular concentrations of the autophagy-related molecules Beclin 1 and LC3II, as 
      well as enhanced acidification of mycobacterial phagosomes and LC3 co-localization. 
      In summary, our data support the notion that AIM contributes to key macrophage 
      responses to M. tuberculosis.

TI  - Are Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis and Epstein-Barr virus triggers of 
      multiple sclerosis in Sardinia?
PG  - 1181-4

AB  - Sardinia acts as an ideal setting for multiple sclerosis (MS) studies because its 
      prevalence of MS is one of the highest worldwide. Several pathogens have been 
      investigated amongst 119 Sardinian MS patients and 117 healthy controls to determine 
      whether they might have a role in triggering MS in genetically predisposed 
      individuals. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) and Epstein Barr 
      virus DNA were detected in 27.5% and 17.3%, respectively, of the MS patients. 
      Moreover an extremely high humoral immune response against MAP recombinant protein 
      MAP FprB (homologous to human myelin P0) was observed, whereas no significant 
      results were found against Mycobacterium tuberculosis FprA and Helicobacter pylori 
      HP986 protein.

PG  - 2271-2277
LID - 10.1007/s10096-020-03978-6 [doi]
AB  - We developed a chemiluminescence immunoassay method based on the recombinant 
      nucleocapsid antigen and assessed its performance for the clinical diagnosis of 
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infections by detecting 
      SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in patients. Full-length recombinant 
      nucleocapsid antigen and tosyl magnetic beads were used to develop the 
      chemiluminescence immunoassay approach. Plasmas from 29 healthy cohorts, 51 
      tuberculosis patients, and 79 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients were employed to 
      evaluate the chemiluminescence immunoassay method performance for the clinical 
      diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. A commercial ELISA kit (Darui Biotech, China) 
      using the same nucleocapsid antigen was used for the in-parallel comparison with our 
      chemiluminescence immunoassay method. The IgM and IgG manner of testing in the 
      chemiluminescence immunoassay method showed a sensitivity and specificity of 60.76% 
      (95% CI 49.1 to 71.6) and 92.25% (95% CI 83.4 to 97.2) and 82.28% (95% CI 72.1 to 
      90.0) and 97.5% (95% CI 91.3 to 99.7), respectively. Higher sensitivity and 
      specificity were observed in the chemiluminescence immunoassay method compared with 
      the Darui Biotech ELISA kit. The developed high sensitivity and specificity 
      chemiluminescence immunoassay IgG testing method combined with the RT-PCR approach 
      can improve the clinical diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infections and thus contribute to 
      the control of COVID-19 expansion.

TI  - The aetiology, clinical presentations and outcome of febrile encephalopathy in 
      children in Papua New Guinea.
PG  - 109-18
LID - 10.1179/146532810X12703902243818 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Febrile encephalopathy, defined as fever, seizures and/or altered 
      consciousness, is a common presentation in children in tropical developing 
      countries. Outcomes range from complete recovery through varying degrees of 
      neurological disability which slowly resolve or remain permanent to death from 
      either the acute illness or complications. Whilst bacterial meningitis accounts for 
      a proportion of children affected, the aetiology in many remains unclear but 
      includes malaria and probably viral encephalitis. AIM: To understand the aetiology, 
      presentation and outcome of febrile encephalopathy in children in Papua New Guinea. 
      METHODS: Children aged between 1 month and 12 years presenting to Port Moresby 
      General Hospital with febrile encephalopathy were studied prospectively. A detailed 
      history and examination and the following laboratory investigations were undertaken 
      as appropriate: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microscopy and bacterial culture, gram 
      stain, measurement of protein and glucose and latex agglutination testing for 
      Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitides; 
      Ziehl-Neelsen staining and india ink examination on selected samples; IgM for 
      Japanese encephalitis, dengue, rubella and measles; PCR testing and mycobacterial 
      culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Blood was tested for flavivirus, measles and 
      rubella IgM and IgG. RESULTS: 149 children were enrolled in the study. 129 had a 
      lumbar puncture and CSF examination; 66 had a normal CSF white cell count. A 
      clinical or laboratory-based diagnosis was possible for 140 children, but a definite 
      pathogen was identifiable for only 55 (37%). The diagnoses included bacterial 
      meningitis in 33 (S. pneumonia 16, H. influenza 13 and N. meningitides 4), 
      tuberculous meningitis (5), probable tuberculous meningitis (18), malaria (10), 
      cryptococcal meningitis (1), flavivirus encephalitis (5), rubella encephalitis (1), 
      hepatic encephalopathy (1) and HIV encephalopathy (1). There were 28 cases of 
      meningitis of unspecified aetiology. Of the five children with IgM-confirmed 
      flavivirus encephalitis, one had dengue serotype 1 and two had Japanese 
      encephalitis. Twenty-five children (including three of the five children with CSF 
      flavivirus IgM) had serological IgG evidence of previous flavivirus infection. A 
      history of multiple convulsions, the presence of neck stiffness and use of the 
      Glasgow coma score (GCS) and TB score chart helped to identify children with 
      bacterial meningitis and an adverse outcome and those with febrile convulsions. 
      CONCLUSION: The study confirms the importance of S. pneumonia and H. influenza as 
      major causes of febrile encephalopathy in children in Papua New Guinea. Flaviviruses 
      including Japanese encephalitis are a cause of the febrile encephalopathy syndrome, 
      as is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. All children with febrile encephalopathy should 
      have their GCS and TB scores recorded and should be examined for neck stiffness, and 
      a history of the frequency of convulsions should be recorded. These basic clinical 
      data can help to discriminate aetiology, to guide treatment and monitoring and to 
      identify the children at highest risk of adverse outcome.

TI  - [A case of listeria meningitis showed high levels of adenosine deaminase in 
      cerebrospinal fluid].
PG  - 590-3
AB  - An 83-year-old woman developed high fever and headache for four days. She had 
      disturbance of consciousness and was admitted to our hospital. A lumbar puncture was 
      performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a white blood cell count 
      of 268/mm3 and culture became positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Six days after 
      admission, the adenosine deaminase (ADA) level in CSF markedly elevated (43.3 IU/L) 
      with pleocytosis, but a negative PCR test for tuberculosis in CSF, sputum, gastric 
      fluid. She recovered by antibiotics for 45 days and ADA level in CSF was normalized. 
      She was diagnosed as listeria meningitis. High levels of ADA in CSF have high 
      sensitivity and high specificity for tuberculous meningitis, but there are some 
      reports that high ADA levels in CSF in other meningitis. The main biological role of 
      ADA is related to proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes, and specific 
      activity of this enzyme is slightly higher in T-lymphocytes than in B-lymphocytes. 
      Protective immunity to Listeria monocytogenes is exclusively exhibited by 
      T-lymphocytes. We consider that increased ADA levels in listeria meningitis 
      associated with elevation of T-lymphocytes in CSF. This report suggests that 
      listeria meningitis must be included in the differential diagnosis of high levels of 
      ADA in CSF.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the comparative performance of different assays used in a 
      Diagnostic Laboratory Hub that linked 13 HIV healthcare facilities for the diagnosis 
      of tuberculosis (TB), histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis, and describing its 
      functions in Guatemala compared with other National Reference Laboratories. METHODS: 
      The following diagnostic techniques were analyzed in 24 months (2017-2018) in a 
      cohort of patients with HIV: smear microscopy, mycobacterial and fungal cultures, 
      isolator blood culture, PCR assays, and antigen detection tests. RESULTS: A total of 
      4245 patients were included, 716 (16.2%) had an opportunistic infection: 249 (34.7%) 
      TB, 40 (5.6%) nontuberculous mycobacteria, 227 (31.7%) histoplasmosis, 138 (19.3%) 
      cryptococcosis, and 62 (8.6%) had multiple opportunistic infections. Two hundred 
      sixty-three [92.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 89-95.1] of TB cases were 
      diagnosed by PCR. Urine antigen assay detected 94% (95% CI, 89-96) of the 
      disseminated histoplasmosis cases. A lateral flow assay to detect cryptococcal 
      antigen diagnosed 97% (95% CI, 93.3-98.7%) of the cryptococcal cases. In 85 patients 
      (51.5%) with a cerobrospinal fluid sample, cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed in 
      55 (64.7%), of which 18 (32.7%) were only detected by cryptococcal antigen. 
      CONCLUSION: Validated commercial antigen tests, as used in this program, should be 
      the new gold standard for histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis diagnosis. In their 
      absence, 35% of disseminated histoplasmosis and 32.7% of cryptococcal meningitis 
      cases would have been missed. Patients with multiple opportunistic infections were 
      frequently diagnosed and strategies should be designed to screen patients 
      irrespective of their clinical presentation. In low resource settings, Diagnostic 
      Laboratory Hubs can deliver quality diagnostics services in record time at 
      affordable prices.

TI  - Etiology and Risk Factors for Mortality in an Adult Community-acquired Pneumonia 
      Cohort in Malawi.
PG  - 359-369
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201807-1333OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: In the context of rapid antiretroviral therapy rollout and an increasing 
      burden of noncommunicable diseases, there are few contemporary data describing the 
      etiology and outcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in sub-Saharan 
      Africa.Objectives: To describe the current etiology of CAP in Malawi and identify 
      risk factors for mortality.Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study 
      of adults hospitalized with CAP to a teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Etiology 
      was defined by blood culture, Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen detection, 
      sputum mycobacterial culture and Xpert MTB/RIF, and nasopharyngeal aspirate 
      multiplex PCR.Measurements and Main Results: In 459 patients (285 [62.1%] males; 
      median age, 34.7 [interquartile range, 29.4-41.9] yr), 30-day mortality was 14.6% 
      (64/439) and associated with male sex (adjusted odds ratio, 2.60 [95% confidence 
      interval, 1.17-5.78]), symptom duration greater than 7 days (2.78 [1.40-5.54]), 
      tachycardia (2.99 [1.48-6.06]), hypoxemia (4.40 [2.03-9.51]), and inability to stand 
      (3.59 [1.72-7.50]). HIV was common (355/453; 78.4%), frequently newly diagnosed 
      (124/355; 34.9%), but not associated with mortality. S. pneumoniae (98/458; 21.4%) 
      and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (75/326; 23.0%) were the most frequently identified 
      pathogens. Viral infection occurred in 32.6% (148/454) with influenza (40/454; 8.8%) 
      most common. Bacterial-viral coinfection occurred in 9.1% (28/307). Detection of M. 
      tuberculosis was associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.44 
      [1.19-5.01]).Conclusions: In the antiretroviral therapy era, CAP in Malawi remains 
      predominantly HIV associated, with a large proportion attributable to potentially 
      vaccine-preventable pathogens. Strategies to increase early detection and treatment 
      of tuberculosis and improve supportive care, in particular the correction of 
      hypoxemia, should be evaluated in clinical trials to address CAP-associated 
      mortality.

TI  - [Influence of JEV E-HSP70 (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) fusion protein on immune 
      response in BALB/c mice].
PG  - 441-5
AB  - JEV infection can cause severe central nerve system disease which result in high 
      mortality or developing permanent neurological sequelae in more than half of the 
      survivors. The envelope (E) protein of JEV is the major antigen peptide fused to it. 
      A recombinant hsp70 protein expression vector pPICZalpha-E-HSP70 in methylotrophic 
      yeast Pichia pastoris was developed that permits major antigenic segment of JEV E 
      protein fused to the amino terminus of M. tuberculosis hsp70. This core vector 
      avoided inclusion bodies formed in Escherichia coli and complex purification. 
      Moreover,it ruled out contamination of LPS. Two other vectors pPICZalpha-E and 
      pPICZalpha-HSP70 were also constructed. The two vectors were constructed by routine 
      molecular technique. All vectors were transformed into yeast X-33 by 
      electroporation. Expression of the fusion protein in yeast was induced by the 
      addition of methanol every 24 hours and analysed by SDS-PAGE and western blot. Major 
      antigenic segment of E protein was produced at a yield of 290 mg per litter of 
      culture, hsp70 protein at a yield of 178 mg per litter of culture and E-HSP70 fusion 
      protein at a yield of 33 mg per litter of culture in methylotrophic yeast Pichia 
      pastoris. To examine cell and body immune response after BALB/c mice were immunized 
      with E-hsp70 fusion protein expressed in Pichia pastoris, there were three groups 
      with ten mice in each group. 5.7 microg (50pmol) of E-hsp70 fusion protein, 2.2 
      microg (50pmol) major antigenic segment of E protein and a mixture of hsp70 and 
      major antigenic segment of E protein (1:1) including 3.5 microg (50pmol) Hsp70 and 
      2.2 microg (50pmol) major antigenic segment of JEV E protein were used per mouse 
      i.p. on day 0 and day 21. The production of mIL-2 was quantitated by 
      semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Besides, proliferation of lymphocytes was measured by MTT 
      and titers of antibody was determined by ELISA. These data show that the fusion 
      protein is a more powerful antigen than major antigenic segment of JEV E protein. So 
      it also illustrates the effectiveness of hsp70 in eliciting a humoral and cellular 
      response to an attached molecule in the absence of adjuvant and affirms the 
      potential utility of hsp70 in vaccine development.

AB  - A slowly growing, non-chromogenic mycobacterial strain was isolated from sputum and 
      bronchial lavage fluid samples of a patient presenting with productive cough, 
      blood-tinged sputum, low-grade fever, and weakness. A positive acid-fast bacilli 
      sputum smear result prompted the initiation of an anti-tuberculosis regimen. 
      Multiplex real-time PCR showed a negative result for Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      complex and a positive result for nontuberculous mycobacteria. The DNA chip test 
      confirmed this organism as a member of the genus Mycobacterium, but could not 
      specify the species. Interestingly, the mycolic acid patterns obtained by HPLC 
      nearly overlapped with those of M. simulans. The sequences of the Mycobacterium 16S 
      rRNA gene and 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer region were unique and were found 
      to have 100% similarity with those of M. riyadhense. After a review of the 
      literature, we report this case as the first Korean case of M. riyadhense lung 
      infection.

AB  - Circulating microRNAs (c-miRNAs) are promising biomarkers for screening, early 
      detection and prognosis of cancer. The purpose of this investigation was to identify 
      a panel of c-miRNAs in plasma that could contribute to early detection of non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We profiled the expression of 44 unique plasma miRNAs in 
      training set of 34 NSCLC patients and 20 matched healthy individuals by miRCURY LNA™ 
      Universal RT microRNA PCR Panel and calculated dysregulation fold changes using the 
      2-ΔΔCt equation. Selected plasma miRNAs were then validated by SYBR green q-RT PCR 
      using an independent validation set of plasma samples from NSCLC patients (n: 72) 
      and NC (n: 50). In the validation set, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curves were generated for four miRNAs. In the training set, 17 miRNAs were 
      significantly up-regulated and nine were down-regulated in the plasma from NSCLC 
      patients versus matched normal controls. Four miRNAs (miR-21, miR-328, miR-375 and 
      miR-141) were selected for validating their diagnostic value in the testing set. ROC 
      plot analysis showed that a high specificity (98%) and sensitivity (82.7%) in 
      miR-141 in comparing early NSCLC patient and controls. So among these four plasma 
      miRNAs only miR-141 could be promising biomarkers for early detection of NSCLC. In 
      addition to, we found a significant positive correlation between stage and miR-21 
      expression level (95% CI: 0.687-0.863; p-value < 0.0001). Considering the 
      accessibility and stability of circulating miRNAs, plasma miR-141 is a useful 
      biomarker early detection of NSCLC as a supplement in future screening studies.

AB  - On April 20, 2015, a female aged 15 years sought care at her pediatrician's office 
      after 5 days of fever, myalgia, left parietal headache, and photophobia. A rapid 
      influenza assay was negative, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and total white 
      blood cell count were normal. She improved with symptomatic care at home, but 
      returned to her pediatrician's office on April 28, reporting recurrence of her 
      headache and photophobia and new onset of a stiff neck. She was admitted to the 
      hospital, where she was febrile to 102.9°F (39.4°C) and had meningismus. Computed 
      tomography scan of her head was normal, and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis 
      showed a markedly elevated white blood cell count with 68% lymphocytes, low glucose, 
      and a negative Gram stain. She was treated empirically for both bacterial and herpes 
      simplex virus meningitis. The patient's hospital course was notable for hypotension 
      (blood pressure 81/50), irritability, and pancreatitis with a peak lipase of 8,627 
      U/L. CSF cultures yielded no growth, and CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing 
      for herpes simplex virus was negative. Nucleic acid amplification testing, acid-fast 
      bacilli stain, and acid-fast bacilli cultures of CSF were negative for Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis. Results of investigations for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, 
      Lyme disease, human herpesvirus 6 and 7, and species of Babesia, Toxoplasma, 
      Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, Blastomyces, and Brucella were negative. She recovered 
      and was discharged on hospital day 11 with no apparent sequelae.

TI  - Evaluation of Interleukin17and Interleukin 23 expression in patients with active and 
      latent tuberculosis infection.
PG  - 844-850
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases with high 
      mortality rates worldwide, especially in developing countries. Interleukin17 (IL-17) 
      is an important acquired immunity cytokine, which is mainly produced by CD4(+)TH17 
      cells. It can recruit neutrophils and macrophages to the infected site in the lungs. 
      IL-23 is one of the most important inducers of IL-17. In the present study, the 
      expressions of IL-23 and IL-17 were examined in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 
      subjects with latent tuberculosis infection (LTB) and newly diagnosed active 
      tuberculosis patients (ATB). PBMCs were activated with purified protein derivative 
      (PPD) for 72 hr. Activated cells were harvested, RNA was extracted, and cDNA was 
      synthesized. IL-17 and IL-23 mRNA expressions were evaluated by real-time PCR. The 
      frequency of Th17 cells was examined by flowcytometry. RESULTS: The expressions of 
      IL-17 and IL-23 mRNA were lower in patients than subjects with LTB (P<0.05). The 
      frequency of IL-17 producing CD4+ T cells in patients with active TB was lower than 
      LTB subjects (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study might suggest 
      that IL-17 and IL-23 play critical roles in the immune response against TB.

AB  - A 77-year-old African American female with rheumatoid arthritis presented with fever 
      and unsteady gait. She was started on broad-spectrum antimicrobials due to CT 
      evidence for sacroiliitis and psoas abscess and underwent partial excision of her 
      sacroiliac bone and drainage of the abscess. One of four blood cultures grew 
      Enterococcus faecalis and the patient was sent home with intravenous ampicillin for 
      6 weeks. Two days after antimicrobial completion, the patient presented with night 
      sweats and weakness. Chest x-ray revealed new right upper lobe pulmonary 
      infiltrates, and the AFB culture sent during her prior admission returned positive 
      for TB. RIPE therapy with moxifloxacin was initiated. Although she responded well to 
      treatment, she retained functional immobility. We report a case of musculoskeletal 
      TB initially misdiagnosed as enterococcus sacroiliitis, resulting in a delayed 
      initiation of anti-tuberculous therapy. A high index of suspicion and rapid 
      detection with TB-PCR testing should be considered to avoid delayed diagnosis.

TI  - Colonization Density of the Upper Respiratory Tract as a Predictor of 
      Pneumonia-Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and 
      Pneumocystis jirovecii.
PG  - S328-S336
LID - 10.1093/cid/cix104 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND. There is limited information on the association between colonization 
      density of upper respiratory tract colonizers and pathogen-specific pneumonia. We 
      assessed this association for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, 
      Staphylococcus aureus, and Pneumocystis jirovecii. METHODS. In 7 low- and 
      middle-income countries, nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs from children with 
      severe pneumonia and age-frequency matched community controls were tested using 
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Differences in median colonization 
      density were evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Density cutoffs were 
      determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. Cases with a pathogen 
      identified from lung aspirate culture or PCR, pleural fluid culture or PCR, blood 
      culture, and immunofluorescence for P. jirovecii defined microbiologically confirmed 
      cases for the given pathogens. RESULTS. Higher densities of H. influenzae were 
      observed in both microbiologically confirmed cases and chest radiograph 
      (CXR)-positive cases compared to controls. Staphylococcus aureus and P. jirovecii 
      had higher densities in CXR-positive cases vs controls. A 5.9 log10 copies/mL 
      density cutoff for H. influenzae yielded 86% sensitivity and 77% specificity for 
      detecting microbiologically confirmed cases; however, densities overlapped between 
      cases and controls and positive predictive values were poor (<3%). Informative 
      density cutoffs were not found for S. aureus and M. catarrhalis, and a lack of 
      confirmed case data limited the cutoff identification for P. jirovecii. CONCLUSIONS. 
      There is evidence for an association between H. influenzae colonization density and 
      H. influenzae-confirmed pneumonia in children; the association may be particularly 
      informative in epidemiologic studies. Colonization densities of M. catarrhalis, S. 
      aureus, and P. jirovecii are unlikely to be of diagnostic value in clinical 
      settings.

TI  - Rapid emergence of cryptococcal fungemia, Mycobacterium chelonae vertebral 
      osteomyelitis and gastro intestinal stromal tumor in a young HIV late presenter: a 
      case report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Highly active antiretroviral therapy has significantly changed the 
      natural history of HIV infection, leading to a dramatic reduction of HIV-related 
      morbidity and mortality. Late Presenters, Very Late Presenters and AIDS presenters 
      still represent, also in Europe, including Italy, a huge challenge in terms of 
      diagnostic and therapeutic management. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old male with a 
      history of fever and back pain. HIV test resulted positive with a high HIV Viral 
      Load and a very low T-CD4 number of cells (5 cells/mm(3)). Imaging investigations 
      revealed multiple vertebral and pulmonary lesions together with abdominal and 
      thoracic lymphadenopathy. Blood cultures were positive for Cryptococcus neoformans 
      and for Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Lymphnode biopsy resulted positive in PCR for 
      Non-Tuberculosis Mycobacteria (Mycobacterium chelonae). A gastric biopsy also 
      revealed a GIST. The patient also had CMV DNA positive. Although we performed 
      antiretroviral therapy and specific-therapies for each disease, he was transferred 
      to intensive care unit where he died due to an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. 
      CONCLUSION: The reported case is unusual due to the relevant number of opportunistic 
      diseases (both infectious and tumoral) emerging not long after the HIV infection had 
      been diagnosed. Late presenters HIV patients and AIDS presenters still represent a 
      challenge, which is often too complex for clinicians to deal with. In spite of 
      proper management, the risk of suboptimal results cannot be excluded.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have generally 
      been limited to the description of the epidemiology and initial clinical 
      characteristics. We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19. 
      METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of 
      COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was 
      February 25, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 
      years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to 
      hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 
      235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 
      16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the 
      patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after 
      onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had 
      significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 
      9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P <0.0001). Radiological aggravation 
      of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of 
      symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. 
      The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory 
      tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to 
      be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P <0.0001). In multivariate 
      logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR = 0.55 
      per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression 
      pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of 
      host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of 
      CVOID-19.

TI  - Molecular adjuvant Ag85A enhances protection against influenza A virus in mice 
      following DNA vaccination.
PG  - 3606-24
LID - 10.3390/v4123606 [doi]
AB  - A novel DNA vaccine vector encoding the Mycobacterium tuberculosis secreted antigen 
      Ag85A fused with the influenza A virus (IAV) HA2 protein epitopes, pEGFP/Ag85A-sHA2 
      (pAg85A-sHA2), was designed to provide protection against influenza. The antigen 
      encoded by the DNA vaccine vector was efficiently expressed in mammalian cells, as 
      determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 
      fluorescence analyses. Mice were immunized with the vaccine vector by intramuscular 
      injection before challenge with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (PR8 virus). Sera and the 
      splenocyte culture IFN-γ levels were significantly higher in immunized mice compared 
      with the control mice. The novel vaccine group showed a high neutralization antibody 
      titer in vitro. The novel vaccine vector also reduced the viral loads, increased the 
      survival rates in mice after the PR8 virus challenge and reduced the alveolar 
      inflammatory cell numbers. Sera IL-4 concentrations were significantly increased in 
      mice immunized with the novel vaccine vector on Day 12 after challenge with the PR8 
      virus. These results demonstrated that short HA2 (sHA2) protein epitopes may provide 
      protection against the PR8 virus and that Ag85A could strengthen the immune response 
      to HA2 epitopes, thus, Ag85A may be developed as a new adjuvant for influenza 
      vaccines.

TI  - The Influence of NAT2 Genotypes on Isoniazid Plasma Concentration of Pulmonary 
      Tuberculosis Patients in Southern Thailand.
LID - 10.4046/trd.2020.0068 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isoniazid (INH) is metabolized by polymorphic N-acetyltransferase 2 
      (NAT2) enzyme, which noticeably alters INH plasma concentration. We aimed to 
      determine the distribution of NAT2 genotype in Thai TB patients and correlate their 
      genotype with plasma isoniazid concentrations. METHODS: Blood samples from 55 newly 
      diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis participants from 3 hospitals were collected to 
      classify the subject by NAT2 genotype performed by the Multiplex Haplotype-Specific 
      PCR method. Patients were grouped into three acetylators (fast, intermediate, and 
      slow). On day 14 of TB treatment, the second blood sample was taken to estimate the 
      peak plasma concentration at two hours after oral administration. INH plasma 
      concentration was analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry/mass 
      spectrometry (LC-Ms/Ms) method. RESULTS: The NAT2 genotype distribution of fast, 
      intermediate, and slow acetylator was 10.9%, 36.4%, and 52.7%, from 6, 20, 29 
      patients, respectively. The median (IQR) of INH plasma concentration at two hours 
      post drug administration for these three genotypes were 0.75 (0.69, 0.86), 2.56 
      (2.12, 3.97), and 4.25 (3.56, 5.5) µg/mL, from 4, 14, 12 cases, respectively. The 
      INH plasma concentration at two hours after administration was significantly 
      associated with body weight and NAT2 acetylator. CONCLUSIONS: The INH plasma 
      concentration was found lower in fast than intermediate and slow acetylators. Body 
      weight and NAT2 acetylator influenced INH plasma concentrations at two hours after 
      drug administration. Therefore, the NAT2 genotype should be known before starting TB 
      treatment to maximize therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - HIV-infected individuals are at high risk of tuberculosis disease and those with 
      prior tuberculosis episodes are at even higher risk of disease recurrence. A 
      non-sputum biomarker that identifies individuals at highest tuberculosis risk would 
      allow targeted microbiological testing and appropriate treatment and also guide need 
      for prolonged therapy. We determined the utility of a previously developed whole 
      blood transcriptomic correlate of risk (COR) signature for (1) predicting incident 
      recurrent tuberculosis, (2) tuberculosis diagnosis and (3) its potential utility for 
      tuberculosis treatment monitoring in HIV-infected individuals. We retrieved 
      cryopreserved blood specimens from three previously completed clinical studies and 
      measured the COR signature by quantitative microfluidic real-time-PCR. The signature 
      differentiated recurrent tuberculosis progressors from non-progressors within 3 
      months of diagnosis with an area under the Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) 
      curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.58-0.85) amongst HIV-infected 
      individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Twenty-five of 43 progressors (58%) 
      were asymptomatic at microbiological diagnosis and thus had subclinical disease. The 
      signature showed excellent diagnostic discrimination between HIV-uninfected 
      tuberculosis cases and controls (AUC 0.97; 95%CI 0.94-1). Performance was lower in 
      HIV-infected individuals (AUC 0.83; 95%CI 0.81-0.96) and signature scores were 
      directly associated with HIV viral loads. Tuberculosis treatment response in 
      HIV-infected individuals on ART with a new recurrent tuberculosis diagnosis was also 
      assessed. Signature scores decreased significantly during treatment. However, 
      pre-treatment scores could not differentiate between those who became sputum 
      negative before and after 2 months. Direct application of the unmodified blood 
      transcriptomic COR signature detected subclinical and active tuberculosis by blind 
      validation in HIV-infected individuals. However, prognostic performance for 
      recurrent tuberculosis, and performance as diagnostic and as treatment monitoring 
      tool in HIV-infected persons was inferior to published results from HIV-negative 
      cohorts. Our results suggest that performance of transcriptomic signatures 
      comprising interferon stimulated genes are negatively affected in HIV-infected 
      individuals, especially in those with incompletely suppressed viral loads.

TI  - Limitations of Using IL-17A and IFN-γ-Induced Protein 10 to Detect Bovine 
      Tuberculosis.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2018.00028 [doi]
LID - 28
AB  - Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is primarily caused by infection with Mycobacterium bovis, 
      which belongs to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. The airborne route is 
      considered the most common for transmission of M. bovis, and more than 15% of cattle 
      with bTB shed the Mycobacterium, which can be detect by nested PCR to amplify 
      mycobacterial mpb70 from a nasal swab from a cow. To screen for cytokines fostering 
      early and accurate detection of bTB, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were 
      isolated from naturally M. bovis-infected, experimentally M. bovis 68002-infected, 
      and uninfected cattle, then these cells were stimulated by PPD-B, CFP-10-ESAT-6 
      (CE), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 6 h. The levels of interferon gamma 
      (IFN-γ), IFN-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), IL-6, IL-12, IL-17A, and tumor necrosis 
      factor alpha mRNA were measured using real-time PCR. To explore the cytokines 
      associated with different periods of M. bovis infection, cattle were divided into 
      three groups: PCR-positive, PCR-negative, and uninfected using the tuberculin skin 
      test, CFP-10/ESAT-6/TB10.4 protein cocktail-based skin test, IFN-γ release assay 
      (IGRA), CFP-10/ESAT-6 (CE)-based IGRA, and nested PCR. The expression of IP-10, 
      IL-17A, and IFN-γ proteins induced by PPD-B, CE, or PBS was detected by ELISA. The 
      results showed that levels of PPD-B-stimulated IL-17A and IP-10 (mRNA and protein), 
      and CE-induced IP-10 (mRNA and protein) were significantly higher in cattle 
      naturally or experimentally infected with M. bovis than in those that were 
      uninfected. The levels of PPD-B- or CE-induced IL-17A and IP-10 (protein) could be 
      used to differentiate M. bovis-infected calves from uninfected ones for 6 to 
      30 weeks post-infection, whereas PPD-B- and CE-induced IP-10 and IL-17A mRNA 
      expression could be used to differentiate M. bovis-infected calves from uninfected 
      ones between 6 and 58 weeks post-infection. However, CE-induced IL-17A (protein) was 
      not a reliable indicator of M. bovis infection in cattle that were confirmed 
      positive for infection by nested PCR. Furthermore, the levels of PPD-B- or 
      CE-induced IP-10 and IL-17A protein were lower than IFN-γ in M. bovis-infected 
      cattle. Therefore, IL-17A and IP-10 protein are not suitable biomarkers for bTB. 
      Antigen-induced IP-10 mRNA should be analyzed further for their potential to be used 
      in the diagnosis of bTB.

TI  - [Peritoneal dialysis-related eosinophilic peritonitis: a case report and literature 
      review].
PG  - 747-751
AB  - Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis is recognized as a common complication 
      of peritoneal dialysis. Eosinophilic peritonitis is a rare type of non-infection 
      PD-related peritonitis. Eosinophilic peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
      dialysis (CAPD) patients was first reported in 1967. The cause of eosinophilic 
      peritonitis is obscure, however it may be related to some etiologies: (1) 
      hypersensitivity to PD materials, including catheter or dialysate; (2) bacteria, 
      fungal or mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Clinical investigations include 
      asymptomatic cloudy PD effluent, fever, abdominal pain and eosinophil count elevate 
      in PD effluent. Eosinophilic peritonitis is usually mild and self-limited. With the 
      development of PD, more eosinophilic peritonitis cases and researches were reported. 
      Here, we report a patient on CAPD with eosinophilic peritonitis. A 71-year-old 
      female patient developed end-stage renal disease for 4 years and underwent CAPD (2 
      000 mL of 1.5% dialysis solution with four exchanges daily) for 5 months. With a 
      history of unclean food, she was hospitalized for complaints of diarrhea, fever and 
      cloudy peritoneal effluent for 10 days. Dialysis effluent showed an elevated white 
      blood cell (WBC) count of 1 980 cell/mm(3), with 60% polymorphonuclear cells. She 
      was diagnosed as PD-related peritonitis, and therapy was initiated with 
      intraperitoneal ceftazidime 1 g once a day and vancomycin 500 mg every other day. 
      She was admitted to the hospital as the symptoms were not relieved. Her peripheral 
      blood cell count showed a total WBC count of 6 940 cells/mm(3), 36.8% eosinophil. 
      Her PD effluent analysis showed turbidity, total WBC count of 1 480 cells/mm(3), and 
      83% polymorphonuclear cells. Her dialysate bacteria culture, fungus culture, 
      polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB-PCR), acid-fast stain 
      were all negative. On admission day 4, the treatments were changed to levofloxacin 
      200 mg once a day and vancomycin 500 mg every other day. After two weeks of 
      antibiotics treatment, patient's symptoms were not completely improved and her 
      dialysis effluent remained cloudy. Her blood eosinophil count elevated to 
      36.8%，eosinophil proportion in PD effluent>90% and PD effluent pathological findings 
      showed eosinophil>90%. Eosinophilic peritonitis was diagnosed and a decision was 
      made to give loratadine daily dose of 10 mg orally. The possible reasons might be 
      the patient's allergy to some components of PD solution or connection systems in the 
      beginning of PD, and this bacterial peritonitis episode, as well as the application 
      of vancomycin, might lead to the fact that eosinophilic peritonitis acutely 
      developed. For there was no improvement in clinical symptoms, loratadine was 
      stopped, and the patient was discharged 18 days later, and received follow-up 
      closely. Two months later, eosinophil count in blood and PD fluid decreased to 
      normal range with no symptom. This case reminds us that in any PD-related 
      peritonitis patient with prolonged symptoms after appropriate antibiotic therapy, 
      and typical clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of eosinophilic peritonitis should be 
      considered. For the count and percentage of eosinophils are not routinely reported 
      in most laboratories, doctors need to contact the department of laboratory and the 
      department of pathology, to confirm the cell count and proportion of eosinophils in 
      dialysis effluent, so as to make the definite diagnosis, which can not only avoid 
      antibiotics overuse, but also avoid antibiotics-induced eosinophilic peritonitis 
      (such as vancomycin).

TI  - Malnutrition in HIV-Infected Children Is an Indicator of Severe Disease with an 
      Impaired Response to Antiretroviral Therapy.
PG  - 46-55
LID - 10.1089/AID.2016.0261 [doi]
AB  - This observational study aimed to describe immunopathogenesis and treatment outcomes 
      in children with and without severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and HIV-infection. We 
      studied markers of microbial translocation (16sDNA), intestinal damage (iFABP), 
      monocyte activation (sCD14), T-cell activation (CD38, HLA-DR) and immune exhaustion 
      (PD1) in 32 HIV-infected children with and 41 HIV-infected children without SAM 
      prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and cross-sectionally compared 
      these children to 15 HIV-uninfected children with and 19 HIV-uninfected children 
      without SAM. We then prospectively measured these markers and correlated them to 
      treatment outcomes in the HIV-infected children at 48 weeks following initiation of 
      ART. Plasma levels of 16sDNA, iFABP and sCD14 were measured by quantitative real 
      time PCR, ELISA and Luminex, respectively. T cell phenotype markers were measured by 
      flow cytometry. Multiple regression analysis was performed using generalized linear 
      models (GLMs) and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
      approach for variable selection. Microbial translocation, T cell activation and 
      exhaustion were increased in HIV-uninfected children with SAM compared to 
      HIV-uninfected children without SAM. In HIV-infected children microbial 
      translocation, immune activation, and exhaustion was strongly increased but did not 
      differ by SAM-status. SAM was associated with increased mortality rates early after 
      ART initiation. Malnutrition, age, microbial translocation, monocyte, and CD8 T cell 
      activation were independently associated with decreased rates of CD4% immune 
      recovery after 48 weeks of ART. SAM is associated with increased microbial 
      translocation, immune activation, and immune exhaustion in HIV-uninfected children 
      and with worse prognosis and impaired immune recovery in HIV-infected children on 
      ART.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a preventable and curable disease, but increased mortality and 
      morbidity associated with TB is one of the leading causes of deaths worldwide. 
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs known to regulate the host immune 
      response against TB. We investigated the expression profile of candidate circulating 
      miRNAs, which could be used as a blood biomarker for the effective diagnosis of 
      pediatric tuberculosis. A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted, including 
      30 children with active-TB and 30 healthy controls (HC) in a tertiary care hospital 
      in Puducherry. We used the SYBR green-based miScript qRT-PCR assay to analyze the 
      expression levels of miRNAs in plasma. Further, we used the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (ROC) to evaluate the diagnostic value of miRNAs. Active-TB 
      included 25 (83.3%) pulmonary TB and 5 (16.7%) extrapulmonary TB cases. We found a 
      significant upregulation of miR-21, miR-29a, miR-31, miR-155, and downregulation of 
      miR-146a in children with active-TB compared to HC. The ROC analysis showed an 
      excellent diagnostic value of miRNAs as follows: miR‑31> miR‑155> miR‑146a with AUC 
      of (95% CI) miRNAs 0.978, 0.953, and 0.903, respectively. Altered circulating miRNA 
      expression levels could be involved in the dysregulation of the host immune response 
      to TB. The ROC analysis indicated that miRNAs miR-31, miR-155 and miR-146a could be 
      effective diagnostic biomarkers for the detection of active-TB in children.

AB  - Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer mortality, needs urgent development of 
      newly qualified diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Recently, Human Endogenous 
      Retroviruses (HERVs) have been introduced for cancer diagnosis. In this case-control 
      study, we have collected blood samples from 60 lung cancer patients and 20 healthy 
      controls. Quantitative gene expression analysis of various HERV env genes, including 
      HERV-R, HERV-H, HERV-K, and HERV-P was performed by real-time PCR. Results indicate 
      that expression of all four HERV env mRNAs is significantly increased in the blood 
      of lung cancer patients than healthy controls (P-values<0.01). Furthermore, we have 
      observed a positive and significant pairwise correlation between the expressions of 
      four HERV env genes. The level of HERV env transcript in the blood of adenocarcinoma 
      patients was generally much higher than squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and small-cell 
      lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Also, the expression of three HERV P, HERV H, and HERV 
      K in the blood of lung cancer patients could significantly differentiate between 
      adenocarcinoma and other types of lung cancer. In conclusion, these four HERV 
      families could be considered as promising non-invasive blood-based biomarkers for 
      prognosis, early detection, and monitoring of lung cancer.

TI  - The Effects of First-Line Anti-Tuberculosis Drugs on the Actions of Vitamin D in 
      Human Macrophages.
PG  - 23-29
LID - 10.1016/j.jcte.2016.08.005 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem. Patients with TB have a high 
      rate of vitamin D deficiency, both at diagnosis and during the course of treatment 
      with anti-tuberculosis drugs. Although data on the efficacy of vitamin D 
      supplementation on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) clearance is uncertain from 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs), vitamin D enhances the expression of the 
      anti-microbial peptide human cathelicidin (hCAP18) in cultured macrophages in vitro. 
      One possible explanation for the mixed (primarily negative) results of RCTs 
      examining vitamin D treatment in TB infection is that anti-TB drugs given to 
      enrolled subjects may impact actions of vitamin D to enhance cathelicidin in 
      macrophages. To address this hypothesis, human macrophage-like monocytic (THP-1) 
      cells were treated with varying doses of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in the 
      presence of the active form of vitamin D, 1N1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) 
      (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)). The expression of hCAP18 was determined by quantitative reverse 
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) strongly induced 
      expression of hCAP18 mRNA in THP-1 cells (fold-change from control). The combination 
      of the standard 4-drug TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and 
      ethambutol) in the cultured THP-1 cells demonstrated a significant decrease of 
      hCAP18 mRNA at the dosage of 10 ug/mL. In 31 subjects with newly diagnosed 
      drug-sensitive TB randomized to either high-dose vitamin D(3) (1.2 million IU over 8 
      weeks, n=13) versus placebo (n=18), there was no change from baseline to week 8 in 
      hCAP18 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in plasma concentrations 
      of LL-37, the protein product of hCAP18.These data suggest that first-line anti-TB 
      drugs may alter the vitamin D-dependent increase in hCAP18 and LL-37 human 
      macrophages.

AB  - Mycobacterium gordonae is a nontuberculous mycobacterium widely distributed in the 
      environment. Although M. gordonae is not usually pathogenic and glomerular lesions 
      due to M. gordonae are very rare, infection has been reported in both 
      immunocompromised patients and healthy persons. We report a case of acute kidney 
      injury (AKI) in which M. gordonae was ultimately identified as the cause. A 
      70-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of fever, polyarthritis, and 
      AKI. He was a hepatitis B virus carrier, suffered from diabetes, and had a past 
      history of erysipelas. No causative bacteria were identified, but coexisting 
      infection was suspected. The patient experienced remission with antibiotic therapy, 
      but the same symptoms recurred eight times. Blood polymerase chain reaction was 
      performed during the 7th recurrence, and M. gordonae was detected. Clarithromycin 
      was initiated, but 2 years after initial hospitalization, the patient died due to M. 
      gordonae infection. In this case, acute kidney injury was a consequence of 
      infection-related glomerulonephritis due to M. gordonae. Mycobacterium is difficult 
      to detect by routine culture methods; therefore, diagnosis remains challenging.

TI  - Construction and analysis of the transcription factor-microRNA co-regulatory network 
      response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis: a view from the blood.
PG  - 1962-1976
AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection has been regional outbreak, recently. The 
      traditional focus on the patterns of "reductionism" which was associated with single 
      molecular changes has been unable to meet the demand of early diagnosis and clinical 
      application when current tuberculosis infection happened. In this study, we employed 
      a systems biology approach to collect large microarray data sets including mRNAs and 
      microRNAs (miRNAs) to identify the differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs in the 
      whole blood of TB patients. The aim was to identify key genes associated with the 
      immune response in the pathogenic process of tuberculosis by analyzing the 
      co-regulatory network that was consisted of transcription factors and miRNAs as well 
      as their target genes. The network along with their co-regulatory genes was analyzed 
      utilizing Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database (TRED) and Database for 
      Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). We got 21 (19 
      up-regulated and 2 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes that were 
      co-regulated by transcription factors and miRNAs. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis 
      showed that the 21 differentially expressed genes were predominantly involved in 
      Tuberculosis signaling pathway, which may play a major role in tuberculosis 
      biological process. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to verify the over 
      expression of co-regulatory genes (FCGR1A and CEBPB). The genetic expression was 
      correlated with clinicopathological characteristics in TB patients and inferences 
      drawn. Our results suggest the TF-miRNA gene co-regulatory network may help us 
      further understand the molecular mechanism of immune response to tuberculosis and 
      provide us a new angle of future biomarker and therapeutic targets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brucellosis is a zoonosis disease which is widespread across the world. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study is the evaluation of culture-negative blood 
      samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients with suspected brucellosis 
      were included in this experimental study and given positive serological tests. 
      Diagnosis was performed on patients with clinical symptoms of the disease, followed 
      by the detection of a titer that was equal to or more than 1:160 (in endemic areas) 
      by the standard tube agglutination method. Blood samples were cultured by a BACTEC 
      9050 system, and subsequently by Brucella agar. At the same time, DNA from all blood 
      samples was extracted by Qiagen Kit Company (Qia Amp Mini Kit). A molecular assay of 
      blood samples was carried out by detection of eryD transcriptase and bcsp 31 genes 
      in specific double PCR reactions. The specificity of the primers was evaluated by 
      DNA from pure and approved Brucella colonies found in the blood samples, by DNA from 
      other bacteria, and by ordinary PCR. DNA extraction from the pure colonies was 
      carried out by both Qiagen Kit and Chelex 100 methods; the two were compared. 
      RESULTS: 39 cases (39%) had positive results when tested by the BACTEC system, and 
      61 cases (61%) became negative. 23 culture-positive blood samples were randomly 
      selected for PCR reactions; all showed 491 bp for the eryD gene and 223 bp for the 
      bcsp 31 gene. Interestingly, out of 14 culture-negative blood samples, 13 cases 
      showed positive bonds in PCR. The specificity of the PCR method was equal to 100%. 
      DNA extraction from pure cultures was done by both Chelex 100 and Qiagen Kit; these 
      showed the same results for all samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results prove that the 
      presented double PCR method could be used to detect positive cases from 
      culture-negative blood samples. The Chelex 100 method is simpler and safer than the 
      use of Qiagen Kit for DNA extraction.

AB  - Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) testing in cattle requires a significant investment of 
      time, equipment, and labor. Novel, rapid, cheaper and accurate methods are needed. 
      The Alere Determine TB lipoarabinomannan antigen (LAM-test) is a World Health 
      Organization-endorsed point-of-care urine test designed to detect active TB disease 
      in humans. The Lionex Animal TB Rapid Test (Lionex-test) is a novel animal specific 
      TB diagnostic blood test. An animal level analysis was performed using urine 
      (n = 141) and milk (n = 63) samples from depopulated BTB-suspected cattle to test 
      the accuracy of the LAM-test when compared to results of positive TB detection by 
      any routine BTB tests (BOVIGAM, necropsy, histology, culture, PCR) that are 
      regularly performed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The 
      agreement between the urine LAM-test and USDA standard tests were poor at varying 
      testing time points. The same milk samples did not elicit statistically significant 
      agreement with the Lionex-test, although positive trends were present. Hence, we 
      cannot recommend the LAM-test as a valid BTB diagnostic test in cattle using either 
      urine or milk. The Lionex-test's production of positive trends using milk samples 
      suggests larger sample sizes may validate the Lionex-test in accurately diagnosing 
      BTB in cattle using milk samples, potentially providing a quick and reliable field 
      test for BTB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a public health concern due to its association 
      with fetal malformation and neurologic disease. OBJECTIVE: To report a reference 
      centre experience on ZIKA virus (ZIKV) infection in travelers from epidemic 
      countries from January 1 to September, 30, 2016 in Italy North-West (a geographic 
      area covering 4.424 million inhabitants, corresponding to almost 73% of Italy 
      North-West area). STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and twelve febrile travelers were 
      studied to rule out a tropical fever [e.g. malaria, dengue (DENV), chikungunya 
      (CHIKV), West Nile (WNV) and ZIKV]. Molecular tests for detecting ZIKV RNA were 
      applied on serum or urine as well as IgG and IgM specific serology. RESULTS: ZIKV 
      was the most frequent "tropical infection (11.6%) with 12 infected travelers and one 
      sexual partner of an infected traveler. At the time of the diagnosis, ZIKV RNA was 
      detected in the blood from 9 patients (69%) within 7 days from symptom onset; 
      afterwards, the virus was detected only in urine (5 patients) and ZIKV IgM was 
      reactive in 9 patients (69%). Travelers with ZIKV infection tested negative for 
      DENV, CHIKV, WNV and malaria and completely recovered. Other infections identified 
      in travelers were DENV (5 patients, 4.5%), CHIKV (1, 0.9%), malaria (Plasmodium 
      vivax, 1, 0.9%), measles (1, 0.9%) and tuberculosis (1, 0.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      etiologic diagnosis of a febrile illness in travelers where ZIKV is endemic is 
      highly desirable as they are sentinel of a challenging epidemiology including the 
      risk of autochthonous transmission in non endemic countries where the competent or 
      carrier vector is present.

TI  - Immunodiagnostics of cerebral toxoplasmosis depending on permeability of blood-brain 
      barrier.
PG  - 285-288
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the work was to detect a diagnostic value of CNSToxoIndex - 
      index of correlation between albumin concentration and anti-toxoplasma antibodies, 
      which reflects local production of anti-toxoplasma IgG in CNS compared with their 
      level in blood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 30 HIV-infected persons 
      with the IV clinical stage (16 man and 14 women) aged from 25 to 49 years with 
      clinical and instrumental signs of cerebral toxoplasmosis were selected from the 
      general array of the patients treated in the Regional Clinical Infectious Hospital. 
      A retrospective parallel detection of IgG T. gondii was performed in serum and CSF 
      in patients, whose results of ELISA or PCR on T. gondii were positive. Blood serum 
      and CSF were obtained from patients at the same time. All samples for analysis were 
      stored at -20 °C and then tested on the RT-2100C Rayto Life and Analytical Sciences 
      Co., Ltd (China) immunoassay analyser for quantitative detection of the level of 
      specific anti-Toxicoplasma IgG. Detection of albumin concentration in serum and CSF 
      was performed on the Chemray-120 Automated Biochemical Analyzer Rayto Life and 
      Analytical Sciences Co., Ltd (China) using the Liquick Cor-ALBUMIN Diagnostic Kit. 
      RESULTS: Results: Specific IgG to T. gondii in blood plasma was found in 27 patients 
      (90%) while in CSF only in 7 (23 %). The results of the research in this group of 
      patients were represented by the following parameters: patient 1 (blood antiToxo IgG 
      - 200 IU/ml, blood albumin - 36 g/l, CSF antiToxo IgG - 10 IU/ml, CSF albumin - 0.8 
      g/l, CNSToxolndex - 2.3); patient 2 (150 / 40 / 90 / 0.7 / 34.3, respectively); 
      patient 3 (90 / 35 / 64 / 0.25 / 99.6); patient 4 (140 / 39/ 10/ 0.19/ 14.7); 
      patient 5 (88 / 52 / 48 / 0.21 / 135.1); patient 6 (160 / 48 / 50 /0.15 / 100.0); 
      patient 7 (122 / 42 / 15 / 0.17 / 30.4). Consequently, taking into consideration the 
      diagnostic marker CNSToxolndex more than 10.0, cerebral toxoplasmosis was diagnosed 
      only in six patients from seven, in whom anti-toxoplasma antibodies in CSF were 
      detected. Patient 1, despite clinical symptoms similar to cerebral toxoplasmosis, 
      and substitute signs of cerebral toxoplasmosis detected with the help of 
      neuroimaging methods (volumetric formation of the right frontal lobe with a 
      ring-shaped enhancement), availability of specific anti-toxoplasma antibodies in 
      blood serum and CSF, diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis has not been confirmed. M. 
      tuberculosis DNA was found in CSF by PCR. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: CNSToxoIndex 
      allows evaluating the local production of anti-toxoplasmic IgG in CNS and their 
      diffusion from blood as a result of the blood-brain barrier damageand it is a 
      powerful method of cerebral toxoplasmosis diagnostics in HIV-positive people as 
      well.

AB  - The Canary Islands contain the most important dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) 
      population in the European Union and are the main export point of dromedaries to 
      continental Europe and Latin America. We investigated the presence of antibodies 
      against relevant disease agents in 100 Canarian camel sera. Selected blood samples 
      of the same animals were also tested by PCR. Sera were tested for antibodies against 
      Bluetongue virus (BTV; 0%), Bovine Viral Diarrhoea virus (BVDV; 0%), Camelpox virus 
      (CPV; 8% by serum neutralization, 16% by ELISA), Peste des Petits Ruminants virus 
      (PPRV, 0%), Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV; 0%) and West Nile Fever virus (WNV; 3%), 
      the bacterial pathogens Anaplasma sp. (3%), Brucella sp. (1%), Coxiella burnetii 
      (19%), Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP; 22%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      complex (MTC; 10%) and Rickettsia sp. (83%), and the parasites Toxoplasma gondii 
      (36%) and Neospora caninum (86%). The most remarkable findings were the detection of 
      antibodies against CPV and the high antibody prevalence against C. burnetii, 
      Rickettsia sp., T. gondii and N. caninum. By PCR, we found no C. burnetii, N. 
      caninum and Anaplasma sp. DNA in the tested samples. However, Rickettsia sp. DNA was 
      detected in six antibody positive tested samples. These results should be taken into 
      consideration in order to implement adequate control measures and avoid a potential 
      dissemination of infections to other territories.

TI  - E-selectin S128R polymorphism leads to severe asthma.
PG  - 49-57
AB  - The E-selectin mediates the interaction of activated endothelial cells with 
      leukocytes and plays a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of asthma. It has been 
      suggested that an S/R (Serine128Arginine) polymorphism of E-selectin alters ligand 
      binding function. Our purpose in this study was to determine whether this 
      Serine128Arginine polymorphism influences the risk of asthma and also to analyze the 
      possible correlation of disease severity in Iranian patients with polymorphism of 
      E-selection. We studied human E-selectin gene polymorphism in 172 asthmatic patients 
      and 173 healthy volunteers by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length 
      polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). To determine the severity of the asthma's situation, a 
      questionnaire was prepared requesting the following information: age, sex, clinical 
      signs and symptoms and past medical history. After the participants filled in the 
      questionnaire, all active or ex-smoker patients were excluded. A trained observer 
      assessed airway reversibility, peak flowmetry and spirometry in asthmatic patients. 
      We found increased serum levels of soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) in asthmatic 
      patients compared with healthy subjects (P<0. 0001). Frequencies of the SS, SR, and 
      RR genotypes were found as 66.3%, 31.4%, and 2.3% in the patients and 91.9%, 8.1%, 
      and 0.0% in control subjects, respectively. The 128Arg allele was more prevalent in 
      patients than controls (OR 5.78; 95% CI, 3.07-10.86, P<0.0001). However, in this 
      study the polymorphism was not associated with circulating sE-selectin levels. We 
      found a direct correlation between the level of sE-selectin and the severity of 
      asthma (P=0.001). On the other hand, there was a close relation between 128Arginine 
      carriage and disease severity (P<0.0001). These results suggest that the Ser128Arg 
      polymorphism of the E-selectin gene is a genetic factor that may be associated with 
      the severity of asthma.

AB  - In 2016, 10.4 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) were reported globally. Malaria 
      also continues to be a global public health threat. Due to marked epidemiological 
      overlap in the global burden of TB and malaria, co-infection does occur. An 
      HIV-infected, 32-year-old male presented with a two-week history of headache with 
      fevers to Mulago National Referral Hospital, Uganda. Five months prior, he was 
      diagnosed with pulmonary TB. He endorsed poor adherence to anti-tuberculous 
      medications. Mycobacterium tuberculosis in CSF was confirmed on Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra. 
      On day 2, he was initiated on dexamethasone at 0.4mg/kg/day and induction 
      TB-medications were re-commenced (rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pyrazinamide) 
      for TBM. He continued to spike high-grade fevers, a peripheral blood smear showed P. 
      falciparum parasites despite a negative malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT). He 
      received three doses of IV artesunate and then completed 3 days of oral 
      artemether/lumefantrine. To our knowledge this is the first published case of 
      HIV-TBM-malaria co-infection. TBM/malaria co-infection poses a number of management 
      challenges. Due to potential overlap in symptoms between TBM and malaria, it is 
      important to remain vigilant for co-infection. Access to accurate parasitological 
      diagnostics is essential, as RDT use continues to expand, it is essential that 
      clinicians are aware of the potential for false negative results. Anti-malarial 
      therapeutic options are limited due to important drug-drug interactions (DDIs). 
      Rifampicin is a potent enzyme inducer of several hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, 
      this induction results in reduced plasma concentrations of several anti-malarial 
      medications. Despite recognition of potential DDIs between rifampicin and 
      artemisinin compounds, and rifampicin and quinine, no treatment guidelines currently 
      exist for managing patients with co-infection. There is both an urgent need for the 
      development of new anti-malarial drugs which do not interact with rifampicin and for 
      pharmacokinetic studies to guide dose modification of existing anti-malarial drugs 
      to inform clinical practice guidelines.

AB  - The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, the European 
      Confederation of Medical Mycology and the European Respiratory Society Joint 
      Clinical Guidelines focus on diagnosis and management of aspergillosis. Of the 
      numerous recommendations, a few are summarized here. Chest computed tomography as 
      well as bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with suspicion of 
      pulmonary invasive aspergillosis (IA) are strongly recommended. For diagnosis, 
      direct microscopy, preferably using optical brighteners, histopathology and culture 
      are strongly recommended. Serum and BAL galactomannan measures are recommended as 
      markers for the diagnosis of IA. PCR should be considered in conjunction with other 
      diagnostic tests. Pathogen identification to species complex level is strongly 
      recommended for all clinically relevant Aspergillus isolates; antifungal 
      susceptibility testing should be performed in patients with invasive disease in 
      regions with resistance found in contemporary surveillance programmes. Isavuconazole 
      and voriconazole are the preferred agents for first-line treatment of pulmonary IA, 
      whereas liposomal amphotericin B is moderately supported. Combinations of 
      antifungals as primary treatment options are not recommended. Therapeutic drug 
      monitoring is strongly recommended for patients receiving posaconazole suspension or 
      any form of voriconazole for IA treatment, and in refractory disease, where a 
      personalized approach considering reversal of predisposing factors, switching drug 
      class and surgical intervention is also strongly recommended. Primary prophylaxis 
      with posaconazole is strongly recommended in patients with acute myelogenous 
      leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving induction chemotherapy. Secondary 
      prophylaxis is strongly recommended in high-risk patients. We strongly recommend 
      treatment duration based on clinical improvement, degree of immunosuppression and 
      response on imaging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to assess mRNA expressions of visfatin and 
      lipocalin-2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with 
      pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). METHODS: Overall, 79 PTB patients and 71 healthy 
      controls were enrolled. In PBMCs, mRNA expressions of visfatin and lipocalin-2 were 
      detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and the 
      diagnostic value of these adipokine mRNAs in PTB patients was calculated through 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: In PBMCs from PTB 
      patients, the visfatin mRNA level was significantly higher than in healthy controls 
      (P < .001), with no significant association between the lipocalin-2 mRNA level and 
      PTB patients (P = .933). In PTB patients, lipocalin-2 mRNA expression positively 
      correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (P = .010). However, the 
      visfatin mRNA level was not associated with any major clinical and laboratory 
      parameter in PTB patients. The ROC curve demonstrated that visfatin could help 
      distinguish PTB patients from healthy controls, with an optimal cutoff value of 
      0.645 and a corresponding sensitivity of 79.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The altered visfatin 
      mRNA expression indicated that this adipokine might play a role in PTB and could be 
      an auxiliary biomarker for PTB diagnosis.

      Active Tuberculosis.
PG  - 4223-4234
LID - 10.2147/IDR.S278705 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify candidate hub genes and miRNAs associated with active 
      tuberculosis (ATB) and reveal the potential molecular mechanisms of disease 
      progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of mRNA and miRNA was evaluated in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 4 ATB patients and 4 healthy donors 
      (HD) using high throughput sequencing (HTS) and bioinformatics analysis. Moreover, 
      differentially expressed miRNAs were validated with 35 ATB patients and 35 HDs using 
      reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). RESULTS: A total of 2658 
      significantly differentially expressed genes (DEG) including 1415 up-regulated genes 
      and 1243 down-regulated genes were identified in the ATB group compared with HDs, 
      and the DEGs enriched in immune-related pathways, especially in TNF signaling 
      pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, mitogen-activated protein kinase 
      (MAPK) signaling pathways and tuberculosis. Additionally, 10 hub genes were acquired 
      according to protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis of DEGs. Moreover, 26 
      differentially expressed miRNAs were found in ATB group compared with HDs. 
      Furthermore, RT-qPCR results showed that hsa-miR-23a-5p (P=0.0106), hsa-miR-183-5p 
      (P=0.0027), hsa-miR-193a-5p (P=0.0021) and hsa-miR-941(P=0.0001) were significantly 
      increased in the ATB patients compared with HD group, and the hsa-miR-16-1-3p was 
      significantly decreased (P=0.0032). CONCLUSION: Our research provided a 
      characteristic profile of mRNAs and miRNAs expressed in ATB subjects, and 10 hub 
      genes related with ATB were found, which will contribute to explore the role of 
      miRNAs and hub genes in the pathogenesis of ATB, and improve the ability of 
      differential diagnosis and treatment for the disease.

TI  - Investigation of ITGB2 gene in 12 new cases of leukocyte adhesion deficiency-type I 
      revealed four novel mutations from Iran.
PG  - 760-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type I (LAD-I) is a rare, autosomal 
      recessive inherited immunodeficiency disease. LAD-I is caused by mutations in the 
      ITGB2 gene and characterized by recurrent severe bacterial infections, as well as 
      impaired wound healing with lack of pus formation. METHODS: In this study, we 
      investigated ITGB2 gene mutations in 12 patients and their parents. Genomic DNA was 
      extracted from whole blood samples. All coding regions of the ITGB2 gene were 
      amplified using PCR and followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Genetic analysis 
      revealed 12 different homozygous mutations, including six missense (c.382G>A, 
      c.2146G>C, c.715G>A, c.691G>C, c.1777C and new c.1686C>A), two new nonsense 
      (c.1336G>T and c.1821C>A), three-frame shift (c.1143delc, c.1907delA and new 
      c.474dupC) and a splice site (c.1877+2T>C). Flow cytometry analysis of CD11/CD18 
      expression on neutrophils revealed defect in CD18 in all twelve cases (1.4% to 42%), 
      CD11a in ten cases (0.1% to 26.7%), CD11b in nine cases (1.2% to 58.8%), and CD11c 
      in all cases (0 % to 18.1%). The patients' parents were both heterozygous carriers. 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings showed four new mutations in the ITGB2 gene. These results 
      can be used for decisive genetic diagnosis, genetic counseling, as well as  prenatal 
      diagnosis for all patients who are suspended to LADI.

      investigation Q192R and L55M polymorphisms.
PG  - 201-6
LID - 10.5847/wjem.j.1920-8642.2015.03.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of increased oxidative stress on the development of chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is well known. One of the antioxidative systems 
      against oxidative stress in human body is paraoxonase (PON) enzyme that protects low 
      density lipoproteins (LDL) against oxidation. This study aimed to explore the 
      polymorphisms on PON1, Q192R, L55M genes of patients with COPD. METHODS: DNAs 
      extraction was obtained from blood samples of 50 patients diagnosed with COPD and 50 
      patients as a control group who were presented to emergency clinic. Genotypes were 
      obtained with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and AIw I and Hsp92II restriction 
      enzymes were used for Q192R and L55M polymorphisms, respectively. Analysis of data 
      was done with the Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: A statistically 
      significant difference in Q192R polymorphism was found between the COPD patients and 
      the control group (P=0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in 
      L55M polymorphisms between the patient and control groups (P>0.05). Q192R 
      polymorphism was significantly correlated with the PON1 gene and cigarette smoking; 
      however other risk factors did not show any significant correlation with this 
      polymorphism. Though L55M polymorphism was significantly correlated with family 
      history and tuberculosis, there was no significant correlation with other risk 
      factors. CONCLUSION: We believe that more studies are needed to study the 
      correlation of L55M polymorphism with other factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM) may impede immune responses in 
      tuberculosis (TB) and thus contribute to enhanced disease severity. In this study, 
      we aimed to evaluate DM-mediated alterations in clinical, radiological and 
      immunological outcomes in TB disease. METHODS: Newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients 
      with or without DM (TB n = 40; TB-DM n = 40) were recruited in Dhaka, Bangladesh. 
      Clinical symptoms, sputum smear and culture conversion as well as chest radiography 
      were assessed. Peripheral blood and sputum samples were collected at the time of 
      diagnosis (baseline) and after 1, 2 and 6 months of standard anti-TB treatment. 
      Blood samples were also obtained from healthy controls (n = 20). mRNA expression of 
      inflammatory markers in blood and sputum samples were quantified using real-time 
      PCR. RESULTS: The majority of TB-DM patients had poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 8%) 
      and displayed elevated pulmonary pathology (P = 0.039) particularly in the middle 
      (P < 0.004) and lower lung zones (P < 0.02) throughout the treatment period. 
      However, reduction of clinical symptoms and time to sputum smear and culture 
      conversion did not differ between the groups. Transcripts levels of the 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β (P = 0.003 at month-1 and P = 0.045 at month-2) and 
      TNF-α (P = 0.005 at month-1) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (P = 0.005 at 
      month-2) were higher in peripheral blood after anti-TB treatment in TB-DM compared 
      to TB patients. Conversely in sputum, TB-DM patients had reduced CD4 (P < 0.009 at 
      month-1) and IL-10 (P = 0.005 at month-1 and P = 0.006 at month-2) transcripts, 
      whereas CD8 was elevated (P = 0.016 at month-2). At 1- and 2-month post-treatment, 
      sputum IL-10 transcripts were inversely correlated with fasting blood glucose and 
      HbA1c levels in all patients. CONCLUSION: Insufficient up-regulation of IL-10 in the 
      lung may fuel persistent local inflammation thereby promoting lung pathology in 
      TB-DM patients with poorly controlled DM.

TI  - Clinical profile of pediatric HIV infection from India.
PG  - 24-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim was to study the clinical profile of pediatric patients admitted 
      with HIV infection. METHODS: The prospective study was conducted from January 2000 
      to October 2001 at a tertiary care referral teaching hospital in Mumbai, India. 
      Admitted in-patients (aged 1 month to 12 years) detected to be HIV-positive (on 
      triple ELISA test) were enrolled in the study. HIV status of patients < 18 months of 
      age was confirmed by DNA-PCR testing. Demographic data, clinical features, 
      investigations and outcome were recorded in a pre-designed proforma. RESULTS: Fifty 
      HIV-positive children (31 males and 19 females; M:F = 1.6:1) were enrolled. Thirty 
      cases were completely immunized, 9 were partially immunized while 11 were not 
      immunized. Forty-two were perinatally infected, while eight cases were infected via 
      blood transfusion (patients with thalassemia major on chronic transfusion therapy). 
      Clinical features at presentation in 42 symptomatic cases included protein-energy 
      malnutrition (90%), fever > 1 month (50%), weight loss > 1 month (50%), persistent 
      generalized lymphadenopathy (24%) and skin manifestations (79%). The 
      gastrointestinal (62%) and respiratory (52%) were the most commonly involved organ 
      systems. Opportunistic infections noted included tuberculosis (19 cases), 
      candidiasis (6 cases), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (4 cases), herpes zoster (3 
      cases) and giardiasis (1 case). Six patients died (mortality, 14%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Perinatal transmission is the most common mode of acquiring HIV in the pediatric age 
      group. Most patients have protein-energy malnutrition. Tuberculosis is common in 
      HIV-infected Indian children. Patients with HIV-encephalopathy have a poor outcome.

TI  - Different Gene Expressions of Alpha and Beta Glucocorticoid Receptors in Asthmatics.
PG  - 790-800
AB  - The response to glucocorticoids (GCs) therapy classifies severe refractory asthma 
      (SRA) and mild asthma, so the glucocorticoid receptors (GCRs) gene expression may be 
      involved in SRA pathogenesis. Thus, it is aimed to compare the expression levels of 
      two GCR isoforms (GCRα and GCRβ) in SRA, mild asthmatics, and healthy controls. 
      Total RNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear lymphocytes of 13 SRA 
      patients, 14 mild asthma patients and 30 healthy volunteers. The expression levels 
      of GCR isoforms were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain 
      reaction (qRT-PCR). The expression level of GCR isoforms did not show any 
      significant difference between the cases/control groups. However, the relative 
      expression analysis between asthma/control, SRA/control and SRA/asthma groups was in 
      the order of 0.933, 0.768 and 0.823 for GCRα and 0.697, 1.014 and 1.454 for GCRβ, 
      respectively. Also, the expression fold change of GCRα/GCRβ in asthma, SRA and 
      control groups was 786.88, 445.72 and 588.13, respectively. The GCRα and GCRβ 
      isoforms did not show any correlation in SRA; but they had significant correlation 
      in both healthy volunteers (r = 0.490, P = 0.007) and mild asthmatics (r = 0.786, P 
      = 0.001). Also, the GCRα expression level had significant inverse correlation with 
      age in SRA (r = -0.709, P = 0.007). Glucocorticoid receptors are related to, but not 
      directly responsible for GC resistance. Since the GCRα/GCRβ expression ratio 
      decreased in SRA, studies are needed to assess its value in diagnosing GC 
      resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli 
      influences tuberculosis (TB) progression. In this study, we aimed to identify the 
      Phe206Leu polymorphism and serum L-selectin level in TB patients, compared to 
      healthy individuals. METHODS: Ninety patients with a diagnosis of TB and 90 healthy 
      controls were selected in this study. The serum L-selectin level was determined, 
      using ELISA. L-selectin polymorphism was also evaluated using PCR. For data 
      analysis, SPSS was used at a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: According to the 
      findings, the mean±SD age of the participants was 57.5 ± 18.4 and 56.5 ± 17.5 years 
      in the TB and healthy groups, respectively. The TB group showed a significantly 
      higher serum L-selectin level (1721.1 ± 330.9) versus the healthy controls 
      (1624 ± 279). The L-selectin Phe allele frequencies were higher than the Leu allele 
      frequencies in the main population, whereas the patients and controls were not 
      significantly different. Eight (0.04%) subjects had Leu/Leu genotypes, 84 (46.6%) 
      carried Phe/Leu genotypes, and 88 (48.8%) had Phe/Phe genotypes. Our results showed 
      that the groups were not significantly different regarding L-selectin genotypes. 
      CONCLUSION: TB patients had a significantly higher serum L-selectin level, compared 
      to the controls. Based on the findings, the incidence of TB and L-selectin 
      polymorphism in the Phe206Leu gene had no significant association.

LID - bcr2016216854
AB  - A 3-year-old girl child presented with swelling in her right lower jaw that had 
      started 5 days previously. History revealed the child being non-immunised. 
      Initial-evaluation revealed proptosis and bony hard swelling over the right body of 
      the mandible. Radiological evaluation including a CT scan indicated expansile 
      osteolytic lesion involving the body-ramus with onion-peel periosteal reaction 
      suggesting osteomyelitis/malignancy. Blood investigations showed raised erythrocyte 
      sedimentation rate and eosinophilia. Family screening for tuberculosis (TB) revealed 
      that the patient, her father and siblings were PPD positive though chest screening 
      and sputum examinations were negative in all of them. Lesion biopsy showed 
      acute/chronic osteomyelitis with eosinophilia, tilting diagnosis towards 
      eosinophilic granuloma/Hand-Schuller-Christian disease. Further investigations for 
      diabetes insipidus, histiocytosis-X, skull-pelvic-femur radiographs, abdominal 
      ultrasonography, ophthalmic consultation and PCR-TB test were negative. Histology, 
      radiography, purified protein derivative (PPD)-positive result and history led to 
      the diagnosis of primary TB of the mandible. Complete resolution occurred following 
      antitubercular therapy. The case report emphasises that diagnosis of TB can 
      sometimes be based on circumstantial evidence and positive response to 
      antitubercular therapy even in view of a negative PCR result.

TI  - Early infant diagnosis and outcomes in HIV-exposed infants at a central and a 
      district hospital, Northern Malawi.
PG  - 83-89
LID - 10.5588/pha.16.0119 [doi]
AB  - Setting: Mzuzu Central Hospital (MZCH), Mzuzu, and Chitipa District Hospital (CDH), 
      Chitipa, Malawi. Objective: To compare management and outcomes of human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exposed infants in early infant diagnosis (EID) 
      programmes at MZCH, where DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is performed 
      on site, and CDH, where samples are sent to MZCH, between 2013 and 2014. Design: 
      Retrospective cohort study. Results: Of infants enrolled at MZCH (n = 409) and CDH 
      (n = 176), DNA PCR results were communicated to the children's guardians in 
      respectively 56% and 51% of cases. The median time from sample collection to 
      guardians receiving results was 34 days for MZCH and 56 days for CDH. In both 
      hospitals, only half of the dried blood spot (DBS) samples were collected between 6 
      and 8 weeks. More guardians from MZCH than CDH received test results within 1 month 
      of sample collection (25% vs. 10%). Among the HIV-positive infants, a higher 
      proportion at MZCH (92%) started antiretroviral therapy than at CDH (46%). The 
      relative risk (RR) of death was higher among infants with late DBS collection (RR 
      1.3, 95%CI 1.0-1.7) or no collection (RR 5.8, 95%CI 4.6-7.2), and when guardians did 
      not receive test results (RR 8.3, 95%CI 5.7-11.9). Conclusion: EID programmes 
      performed equally poorly at both hospitals, and might be helped by point-of-care DNA 
      PCR testing. Better programme implementation and active follow-up might improve 
      infant outcome and retention in care.

TI  - Case Study and Attempt of Treatment of Mycobacteriosis Caused by Mycobacterium avium 
      in a Parental Flock of Meat-Breed Pigeons.
PG  - 335-342
LID - 10.1637/aviandiseases-D-19-00148 [doi]
AB  - Mycobacteriosis caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium was observed in a 
      parental loft of 70 meat-breed pigeons. It was decided to undertake treatment as the 
      birds represented a substantial value to the owner. A multiagent therapy using 
      azithromycin, marbofloxacin, and ethambutol was administered. After 4 mo of therapy, 
      the desired results were not obtained. At the end of treatment, the birds were in 
      poor general condition, with white blood cells above 20 g/L, and after clutching, 
      2-yr-old and older birds were euthanatized. Overall, postmortem lesions were found 
      in 17 out of 49 necropsied individuals. Slide agglutination tests with a M. avium 
      subsp. avium lysate were conducted in all examined pigeons. In 28 pigeons, blood 
      count was conducted once a month during therapy, while in 24 pigeons, a tuberculin 
      sensitivity test was conducted before the planned euthanatization. The tuberculin 
      sensitivity test did not prove useful in the diagnosis of ill individuals. Slide 
      agglutination yielded positive results in only four birds, all of which also had 
      postmortem lesions. Blood count in a large number of cases allowed distinguishing 
      between ill and healthy individuals, which was used for subsequent selection. The 
      comparison of cultured strains with the (CCG)4-based PCR method showed the variation 
      of M. avium isolates up to a maximum of 30%. The described case proves that the 
      treatment of mycobacteriosis in pigeon flocks is not effective, mainly due to the 
      high resistance to M. avium subsp. avium. In addition, therapy may contribute to an 
      even greater increase in mycobacterial resistance to antibiotics, which may pose a 
      potential risk to public health.

AB  - Increasing knowledge about the molecular profile of tumors has led to personalized 
      treatment for achieving better outcomes in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC). Currently, finding exact somatic genomic changes of tumor has gained great 
      importance. On the other hand, crescendoing needs to actual tumor tissue at 
      different time points during cancer treatment may produce major discomfort for NSCLC 
      patients. Tumor genomes can be reconstructed by information obtained from 
      circulating cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (cfDNA) of peripheral blood. cfDNA may 
      be represented as a suitable alternative test  for epidermal growth factor receptor 
      (EGFR) mutation detection in these patients. This study aimed to assess validity of 
      cfDNA in somatic EGFR mutation identification in Iranian NSCLC cases. METHODS: 
      Somatic mutation of EGFR gene was studied in both tissue specimens and plasma. Then, 
      mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and sequencing. RESULTS: 
      We observed a high concordance (90%) between tissue samples and cfDNA for EGFR gene 
      mutation.  The sensitivity, accuracy, and positive precision value were 90%, 90% and 
      100%, respectively. A false negative rate of 10% was also demonstrated in this 
      study. CONCLUSION: We established sensitive methods for detecting EGFR gene mutation 
      which may be very useful in clinical practice.<br />.

TI  - Visceral leishmaniasis in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - 102-5
LID - 10.1016/j.idcr.2015.09.006 [doi]
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis is an infection with an insidious and disabling course caused 
      by parasites of the genus Leishmania. In Europe, it is mostly associated with HIV 
      infection. Systemic lupus erythematosus and its treatment are associated with 
      increased risk of infection, neoplastic and concomitant autoimmune disorders. The 
      association of these diseases may go unnoticed. A 60 year-old Caucasian woman with 
      lupus presented with a one-year history of fever, malaise, weakness and weight loss. 
      The highlights on physical examination were pallor, palpable hepatosplenomegaly and 
      low-grade fever. Blood tests showed pancytopenia, hyperproteinemia with 
      hypoalbuminemia and hypergammaglobulinemia; electrophoresis showed a polyclonal 
      gamma curve. Full-body CT scan revealed massive hepatosplenomegaly. Microbiology 
      investigation was negative for the most common pathogens, including tuberculosis. 
      There were no signs of hematologic malignancy in the bone marrow smear. PCR for 
      Leishmania infantum was positive both in blood and bone marrow. The patient was 
      treated with liposomal amphotericin B, and immunosuppression was adjusted. She 
      showed rapid clinical improvement and 6 months later had no signs of disease. The 
      differential diagnosis in a patient with lupus presenting with fever and 
      multisystemic manifestations includes infectious or neoplastic disorders. The 
      patient lived in an endemic area of Leishmania, and typical clinical and analytical 
      changes were all present, making this case highly educational. The case highlights 
      the importance of a patient's epidemiological background and how it can lead to the 
      diagnosis and timely treatment of a rare disease.

TI  - Ancient dental pulp: Masterpiece tissue for paleomicrobiology.
PG  - e1202
LID - 10.1002/mgg3.1202 [doi]
LID - e1202
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dental pulp with special structure has become a good reference sample 
      in paleomicrobiology-related blood-borne diseases, many pathogens were detected by 
      different methods based on the diagnosis of nucleic acids and proteins. OBJECTIVES: 
      This review aims to propose the preparation process from ancient teeth collection to 
      organic molecule extraction of dental pulp and summary, analyze the methods that 
      have been applied to detect septicemic pathogens through ancient dental pulps during 
      the past 20 years following the first detection of an ancient microbe. METHODS: The 
      papers used in this review with two main objectives were obtained from PubMed and 
      Google scholar with combining keywords: "ancient," "dental pulp," "teeth," 
      "anatomy," "structure," "collection," "preservation," "selection," "photography," 
      "radiography," "contamination," "decontamination," "DNA," "protein," "extraction," 
      "bone," "paleomicrobiology," "bacteria," "virus," "pathogen," "molecular biology," 
      "proteomics," "PCR," "MALDI-TOF," "LC/MS," "ELISA," "immunology," 
      "immunochromatography," "genome," "microbiome," "metagenomics." RESULTS: The 
      analysis of ancient dental pulp should have a careful preparation process with many 
      different steps to give highly accurate results, each step complies with the rules 
      in archaeology and paleomicrobiology. After the collection of organic molecules from 
      dental pulp, they were investigated for pathogen identification based on the 
      analysis of DNA and protein. Actually, DNA approach takes a principal role in 
      diagnosis while the protein approach is more and more used. A total of seven 
      techniques was used and ten bacteria (Yersinia pestis, Bartonella quintana, 
      Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi C, 
      Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia prowazeki, 
      Staphylococcus aureus, Borrelia recurrentis, Bartonella henselae) and one virus 
      (Anelloviridae) were identified. Y. pestis had the most published in quantity and 
      all methods were investigated for this pathogen, S. aureus and B. recurrentis were 
      identified by three different methods and others only by one. The combining methods 
      interestingly increase the positive rate with ELISA, PCR and iPCR in Yersinia pestis 
      diagnosis. Twenty-seven ancient genomes of Y. pestis and one ancient genome of B. 
      recurrentis were reconstructed. Comparing to the ancient bone, ancient teeth showed 
      more advantage in septicemic diagnosis. Beside pathogen identification, ancient pulp 
      help to distinguish species. CONCLUSIONS: Dental pulp with specific tissue is a 
      suitable sample for detection of the blood infection in the past through DNA and 
      protein identification with the correct preparation process, furthermore, it helps 
      to more understand the pathogens of historic diseases and epidemics.

TI  - Disease extent and anti-tubercular treatment response correlates with Mycobacterium

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The development of non-sputum-based assays for tuberculosis (TB) 
      diagnosis and treatment monitoring is a key priority. Recent data indicate that 
      whole blood-based assays to assess the phenotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      (Mtb)-specific CD4 T cells hold promise for this purpose and require further 
      investigation in well-characterised TB cohorts. In this study, we investigated the 
      relationship between the phenotypic signature of Mtb-specific CD4 responses, TB 
      disease extent and treatment response. METHODS: Using flow cytometry, we measured 
      the expression of phenotypic and functional markers (HLA-DR, CD27, CD153, KLRG1, 
      IL-2, MIP-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ) on Mtb-specific CD4 T-cells in whole blood from 161 
      participants of varying TB and HIV status. TB disease extent was graded as a 
      continuum using the Xpert(ct) value, C-reactive protein, Timika radiographic score 
      and monocyte/lymphocyte ratio. RESULTS: The phenotypic profile of Mtb-specific CD4 T 
      cells pre-anti-tubercular treatment (ATT) strongly correlated with disease extent, 
      irrespective of HIV status. ATT associated with major changes in the phenotype of 
      Mtb-specific CD4 T cells, with decreased expression of HLA-DR and increased CD27 and 
      CD153 expression. Principal component analysis showed an almost complete separation 
      between latent TB infection (LTBI) and active TB (aTB) pre-ATT groups, whereas the 
      profile of the aTB post-ATT group overlapped with the LTBI group. However, in 
      patients experiencing treatment failure or relapse, no significant changes were 
      observed in Mtb-specific CD4 T-cell phenotype pre- and post-ATT. CONCLUSION: Whole 
      blood-based assays of Mtb-specific CD4 T-cell activation and maturation markers can 
      be used as non-sputum-based biomarkers of disease extent and treatment monitoring in 
      TB, regardless of HIV-1 status.

TI  - Efficacy of extended DOTS category I chemotherapy in spinal tuberculosis based on 
      MRI-based healed status.
PG  - 633-9
LID - 10.4103/0019-5413.104191 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Duration of treatment in tuberculosis of spine has always been debatable 
      in the absence of marker of healing. The objective of the study was to evaluate the 
      efficacy of extended DOTS regimen (2 months of intensive phase and 6 months of 
      continuation phase) as recommended by WHO, by using MRI observations as the healing 
      marker. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 51 (Group A -28 prospective and Group B- 23 
      retrospective) patients of spine TB with mean age of 26.8 years (range 15-54 years) 
      diagnosed clinico radiologically/imaging (n=36), histopathology or by PCR (n=15) 
      were enrolled for the study. They were treated by extended DOTS regimen (2 months of 
      HRZE and 6 months of HR) administered alternate day. The serial blood investigations 
      and X-rays were done every 2 months. Contrast MRI was done at the end of 8 months 
      and healing changes were recorded. Criteria of healing on the basis of MRI being: 
      complete resolution of pre and paravertebral collections, resolution of marrow edema 
      of vertebral body (VB), replacement of marrow edema by fat or by calcification 
      suggested by iso- intense T1 and T2 weighted images in contrast enhanced MRI. 
      Patients with non healed status, but, responding lesion on MRI after 8 months of 
      treatment were continued on INH and rifampicin alternate day and contrast MRI was 
      done subsequently at 12 months and 18 months till the healed status was achieved . 
      RESULTS: 9 patients had paraplegia and required surgical intervention out of which 1 
      did not recover neurologically. All patients have completed 8 months of extended 
      DOTS regimen, n=18 achieved healed status and duration of treatment was extended in 
      rest (n=33) 5 were declared healed after 12 months, 8 after 18 months and one after 
      36 months of treatment, thus 32 were declared healed at varying periods. CONCLUSION: 
      35.2% patients demonstrate MRI based healed vertebral lesion at the end of 8 months 
      of extended category 1 DOTS regimen. It is unscientific to stop the ATT by fixed 
      time frame and MRI evaluation of the patients is required after 8 months of ATT and 
      subsequently to decide for the continuation stoppage of treatment.

TI  - Relative expressions of miR-205-5p, miR-205-3p, and miR-21 in tissues and serum of 
      non-small cell lung cancer patients.
PG  - 67-75
LID - 10.1007/s11010-013-1755-y [doi]
AB  - Objective was to assess and compare the relative expressions of miR-205-5p, 
      miR-205-3p, and miR-21-3p in tissues and serum among non-small cell lung carcinoma 
      (NSCLC) patients, benign pulmonary conditions patients, and healthy volunteers. 
      Serum samples were obtained between October 2011 and September 2012 from 20 NSCLC 
      patients undergoing surgical treatment, 20 patients diagnosed with a benign lung 
      disease (pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
      or interstitial pneumonia) (lesion group), and 20 healthy volunteers (control 
      group). NSCLC patients provided cancer tissues and cancer-adjacent normal tissues 
      during surgery (paired specimens). Quantitative RT-PCR was used to assess 
      miR-205-5p, miR-205-3p, and miR-21-3p expressions in serum and tissue samples. The 
      relative expressions of miR-205-5p and miR-205-3p were significantly higher in NSCLC 
      tissues compared with cancer-adjacent paired specimens (both P < 0.001). In the 
      serum, significantly higher miR-205-5p, miR-205-3p, and miR-21-3p relative 
      expressions were observed in the NSCLC group compared with the two other groups (all 
      P < 0.001). The relative expressions of miR-205-5p and miR-21-3p in NSCLC tissues 
      and serum were significantly correlated (r = 0.553, P = 0.011; and r = -0.541, P = 
      0.014, respectively), while no significant correlation was observed for miR-205-3P 
      (P = 0.120). Expressions of miR-205-5p and miR-205-3P in squamous cell carcinoma 
      specimens were significantly higher than in lung adenocarcinoma specimens (both P = 
      0.001). Similarly, higher serum miR-205-5p and miR-205-3p levels were observed in 
      squamous cell carcinoma patients (P = 0.033 and P = 0.002, respectively). In this 
      preliminary and novel study, miR-205-5p was more useful as a marker for NSCLC than 
      miR-205-3p or miR-21, indicating a potential for future applications in NSCLC 
      diagnosis and prognosis.

TI  - The Study of IL-10 and IL-17A Genes Expression in Patients with Different Stages of 
      Asthma: a Case-Control Study.
PG  - 146-154
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma is considered as a complex disorder in which genetics and 
      environment play crucial role in its susceptibility. In addition to the huge 
      financial costs that significantly reduce the quality of life of the patients and 
      their families, it causes high prevalence of lung diseases. Finding contributing new 
      genetic factors involved in early diagnosis or progression of asthma can provide 
      novel approaches for treatment or managing of asthma. In the present study, the 
      potential role of two key cytokines of IL-10 and IL-17A was investigated in asthma 
      pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using real-time PCR technique, we analyzed the 
      expression levels of target genes in two groups of mild and severe asthma patient in 
      comparison with healthy individuals. RESULTS: In comparison with control population, 
      obtained data showed 4 and 7-fold down-regulation of IL-17A in the group of mild and 
      severe asthma, respectively. Down-regulation of IL-17A showed a significant 
      correlation with progression of asthma severity. While IL-10 showed up to 10-fold 
      down-regulation in the group of severe asthma, its expression level was not 
      correlated with severity of asthma. CONCLUSION: Obtained data revealed that 
      deregulation IL-10 and IL-17A have potential to play crucial role in pathogenesis 
      and prognosis of asthma. Observed down-regulation of these cytokines in blood cells 
      suggests their usefulness as a marker in diagnosis of asthmatic types in patients.

TI  - Effect of generalised access to early diagnosis and treatment and targeted mass drug 
      administration on Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Eastern Myanmar: an observational 
      study of a regional elimination programme.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Potentially untreatable Plasmodium falciparum malaria threatens the 
      Greater Mekong subregion. A previous series of pilot projects in Myanmar, Laos, 
      Cambodia, and Vietnam suggested that mass drug administration was safe, and when 
      added to provision of early diagnosis and treatment, could reduce the reservoir of P 
      falciparum and interrupts transmission. We examined the effects of a scaled-up 
      programme of this strategy in four townships of eastern Myanmar on the incidence of 
      P falciparum malaria. METHODS: The programme was implemented in the four townships 
      of Myawaddy, Kawkareik, Hlaingbwe, and Hpapun in Kayin state, Myanmar. Increased 
      access to early diagnosis and treatment of malaria was provided to all villages 
      through community-based malaria posts equipped with rapid diagnostic tests, and 
      treatment with artemether-lumefantrine plus single low-dose primaquine. Villages 
      were identified as malarial hotspots (operationally defined as >40% malaria, of 
      which 20% was P falciparum) with surveys using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR 
      either randomly or targeted at villages where the incidence of clinical cases of P 
      falciparum malaria remained high (ie, >100 cases per 1000 individuals per year) 
      despite a functioning malaria post. During each survey, a 2 mL sample of venous 
      blood was obtained from randomly selected adults. Hotspots received targeted mass 
      drug administration with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus single-dose primaquine 
      once per month for 3 consecutive months in addition to the malaria posts. The main 
      outcome was the change in village incidence of clinical P falciparum malaria, 
      quantified using a multivariate, generalised, additive multilevel model. Malaria 
      prevalence was measured in the hotspots 12 months after mass drug administration. 
      FINDINGS: Between May 1, 2014, and April 30, 2017, 1222 malarial posts were opened, 
      providing early diagnosis and treatment to an estimated 365 000 individuals. 
      Incidence of P falciparum malaria decreased by 60 to 98% in the four townships. 272 
      prevalence surveys were undertaken and 69 hotspot villages were identified. By April 
      2017, 50 hotspots were treated with mass drug administration. Hotspot villages had a 
      three times higher incidence of P falciparum at malarial posts than neighbouring 
      villages (adjusted incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2·7, 95% CI 1·8-4·4). Early diagnosis 
      and treatment was associated with a significant decrease in P falciparum incidence 
      in hotspots (IRR 0·82, 95% CI 0·76-0·88 per quarter) and in other villages (0·75, 
      0·73-0·78 per quarter). Mass drug administration was associated with a five-times 
      decrease in P falciparum incidence within hotspot villages (IRR 0·19, 95% CI 
      0·13-0·26). By April, 2017, 965 villages (79%) of 1222 corresponding to 104 village 
      tracts were free from P falciparum malaria for at least 6 months. The prevalence of 
      wild-type genotype for K13 molecular markers of artemisinin resistance was stable 
      over the three years (39%; 249/631). INTERPRETATION: Providing early diagnosis and 
      effective treatment substantially decreased village-level incidence of 
      artemisinin-resistant P falciparum malaria in hard-to-reach, politically sensitive 
      regions of eastern Myanmar. Targeted mass drug administration significantly reduced 
      malaria incidence in hotspots. If these activities could proceed in all contiguous 
      endemic areas in addition to standard control programmes already implemented, there 
      is a possibility of subnational elimination of P falciparum. FUNDING: The Bill & 
      Melinda Gates Foundation, the Regional Artemisinin Initiative (Global Fund against 
      AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria), and the Wellcome Trust.

AB  - Sexually transmitted infection (STI) of the upper reproductive tract can result in 
      inflammation and infertility. A biomarker of STI-induced upper tract inflammation 
      would be significant as many women are asymptomatic and delayed treatment increases 
      risk of sequelae. Blood mRNA from 111 women from three cohorts was profiled using 
      microarray. Unsupervised analysis revealed a transcriptional profile that 
      distinguished 9 cases of STI-induced endometritis from 18 with cervical STI or 
      uninfected controls. Using a hybrid feature selection algorithm we identified 21 
      genes that yielded maximal classification accuracy within our training dataset. 
      Predictive accuracy was evaluated using an independent testing dataset of 5 cases 
      and 10 controls. Sensitivity was evaluated in a separate test set of 12 women with 
      asymptomatic STI-induced endometritis in whom cervical burden was determined by PCR; 
      and specificity in an additional test set of 15 uninfected women with pelvic pain 
      due to unknown cause. Disease module preservation was assessed in 42 women with a 
      clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). We also tested the ability 
      of the biomarker to discriminate STI-induced endometritis from other diseases. The 
      biomarker was 86.7% (13/15) accurate in correctly distinguishing cases from controls 
      in the testing dataset. Sensitivity was 83.3% (5/6) in women with high cervical 
      Chlamydia trachomatis burden and asymptomatic endometritis, but 0% (0/6) in women 
      with low burden. Specificity in patients with non-STI-induced pelvic pain was 86.7% 
      (13/15). Disease modules were preserved in all 8 biomarker predicted cases. The 
      21-gene biomarker was highly discriminatory for systemic infections, lupus, and 
      appendicitis, but wrongly predicted tuberculosis as STI-induced endometritis in 
      52.4%. A 21-gene biomarker can identify asymptomatic women with STI-induced 
      endometritis that places them at risk for chronic disease development and 
      discriminate STI-induced endometritis from non-STI pelvic pain and other diseases.

TI  - Presence of Plasmodium falciparum DNA in Plasma Does Not Predict Clinical Malaria in 
      an HIV-1 Infected Population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-1 and Plasmodium falciparum malaria cause substantial morbidity in 
      Sub-Saharan Africa, especially as co-infecting pathogens. We examined the 
      relationship between presence of P. falciparum DNA in plasma samples and clinical 
      malaria as well as the impact of atazanavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI), on P. 
      falciparum PCR positivity. METHODS: ACTG study A5175 compared two NNRTI-based 
      regimens and one PI-based anti-retroviral (ARV) regimen in antiretroviral therapy 
      naïve participants. We performed nested PCR on plasma samples for the P. falciparum 
      18s rRNA gene to detect the presence of malaria DNA in 215 of the 221 participants 
      enrolled in Blantyre and Lilongwe, Malawi. We also studied the closest sample 
      preceding the first malaria diagnosis from 102 persons with clinical malaria and 
      randomly selected follow up samples from 88 persons without clinical malaria. 
      RESULTS: PCR positivity was observed in 18 (8%) baseline samples and was not 
      significantly associated with age, sex, screening CD4+ T-cell count, baseline HIV-1 
      RNA level or co-trimoxazole use within the first 8 weeks. Neither baseline PCR 
      positivity (p = 0.45) nor PCR positivity after initiation of antiretroviral therapy 
      (p = 1.0) were significantly associated with subsequent clinical malaria. 
      Randomization to the PI versus NNRTI ARV regimens was not significantly associated 
      with either PCR positivity (p = 0.5) or clinical malaria (p = 0.609). Clinical 
      malaria was associated with a history of tuberculosis (p = 0.006) and a lower BMI (p 
      = 0.004). CONCLUSION: P. falciparum DNA was detected in 8% of participants at 
      baseline, but was not significantly associated with subsequent development of 
      clinical malaria. HIV PI therapy did not decrease the prevalence of PCR positivity 
      or incidence of clinical disease.

AB  - Background: Lung cancer is one of the main human health threats. Survival of lung 
      cancer patients depends on the timely detection and diagnosis. Among the genetic 
      irregularities that control cancer development and progression, there are microRNAs 
      (miRNAs). This study aimed to assess the plasma level of circulating miRNA-17 and 
      miRNA-222 as non-invasive markers in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. 
      Patients and methods: A total of 40 patients with NSCLC and 20 healthy controls who 
      were matched in terms of age and sex with the patient group were included in this 
      case-control study.. Estimation of miRNA-17 and miRNA-222 expression profiles in the 
      plasma was done using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The relationship between 
      both markers and their clinicopathological features were also determined. Receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was done to evaluate the role of these 
      microRNAs in NSCLC diagnosis and follow-up. Results: MiRNA-17 and miRNA-222 levels 
      were significantly upregulated in NSCLC patients compared with controls (48.32±12.35 
      vs 1.16±0.19 and 34.53±3.1 vs 1.22±0.14) (P=0.000). Plasma miRNA-17 level was 
      increased, and the miRNA-222 level was decreased across different stages of the 
      disease; however, these differences d were not statistically significant (P=0.4, 
      P=0.5, respectively). The miRNA-17 levels were higher in the lung cancer patients 
      with metastasis , but miRNA-222 levels were lower patients without metastasis. We 
      found no statistically significant difference in this regard(P=0.4 vs P=0.3, 
      respectively). ROC curve analysis showed that the sensi¬tivity and specificity of 
      miRNA-17 were 77.78% and 87.50% , and of miRNA-222 were 50% and 88.89%. Conclusion: 
      MiRNA-17 and miRNA-222 can be considered as non-invasive biomarkers for detection of 
      early lung carcinogenesis and metastasis in patients with NSCLC, hence providing a 
      basis for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular protozoan parasite, can induce various clinical 
      symptoms. T. gondii has been considered to play an important role in the 
      pathogenesis of lung diseases. This survey was conducted to explore the correlation 
      between T. gondii infection and lung diseases through a case-control study carried 
      out in Shandong province, eastern China. In the present survey, T. gondii IgG 
      antibodies were found in 76/398 (19.10%) of patients with lung diseases, which was 
      significantly higher (P < 0.001) than the level found in the control subjects 
      (35/398; 8.79%) through serological diagnosis. Patients with lung cancer have the 
      highest T. gondii seroprevalence (26.19%), followed by Pulmonary cyst (25.00%), 
      Tuberculosis (17.07%), Pneumonia (16.33%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
      (COPD) (16.05%). Moreover, a semi-nest PCR targeted T. gondii B1 gene was employed 
      to detect the T. gondii DNA in the blood samples. T. gondii DNA was detected in 
      5.53% blood samples of patients with lung diseases and 2.51% control subjects, 
      respectively. The present study firstly shows that T. gondii has a high probability 
      to infect the patients with lung diseases. Thus, the potential presence of T. gondii 
      in patients with lung diseases should be appreciated during in the course of 
      treatment and safeguard procedures should be implemented to protect vulnerable 
      patients with lung diseases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The role of fat-bone interactions in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis 
      in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is poorly understood. Our aim was to 
      investigate expressions of leptin and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the adipose tissue, 
      and their relationships to osteoporosis in patients with COPD. METHODS: In 39 
      patients with stable COPD, bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition was 
      assessed by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry. Serum leptin was determined by the 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and bone turnover markers osteocalcin and 
      β-crosslaps by the electrochemiluminiscence immunoassays. Subcutaneous adipose 
      tissue samples were analyzed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients 
      without, and 18 with osteoporosis were enrolled (35 men; age 62.2 ± 7.3years). 
      Compared to patients without osteoporosis, those with the disease had significantly 
      lower serum levels and adipose tissue expressions of leptin, in association with 
      increased serum β-crosslaps (p=0.028, p=0.034, p=0.022, respectively). Log adipose 
      tissue leptin was inversely related to serum β-crosslaps (p=0.015), and directly to 
      serum leptin (p<0.001) and to the total, femoral, and lumbar BMD and T-score (p<0.02 
      for all relationships). Adipose tissue OPG expression was related to all variables 
      of bone density except for lumbar BMD and T-score (p<0.05 for all relationships). 
      Log adipose tissue leptin and OPG expressions predicted femoral T-score 
      independently of age, gender and pulmonary function (p<0.001, adjusted R(2)=0.383; 
      p=0.008, adjusted R(2)=0.301, respectively). Introducing body mass (or fat mass) 
      index into these models eliminated independent predictive value of leptin and OPG 
      expressions. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that adipose tissue leptin and OPG 
      expressions are related to osteoporosis in patients with COPD, and appear to act as 
      mediators between fat mass and BMD.

      patients (60 y of age or older) were randomized to receive trivalent influenza 
      vaccine (Sanofi-Pasteur, France) either 9 µg of hemagglutinin (HA) per strain split 
      into 2-site intradermal (ID) injections via the Mantoux technique or one 
      intramuscular (IM) injection of 15 µg of HA per strain. The geometric mean titers, 
      seroconversion factors, seroconversion rates and seroprotection rates for influenza 
      A(H3N2) and B administered through the ID injection (n = 75) were similar to those 
      obtained with the IM injection (n = 74) 4 weeks post-vaccination. The antibody 
      responses for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 administered through the ID injection were 
      lower than those obtained with the IM injection, but all of these responses met the 
      3 criteria proposed by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) for 
      annual re-licensure. The seroprotection rates 4 weeks post-vaccination for influenza 
      A(H1N1)pdm09 were 64.0% (95%CI 52.7-74.0%) in the ID group vs. 78.4% (95% CI 
      67.6-86.3%) in the IM group (p = 0.053). Influenza-related acute respiratory illness 
      (ARI), diagnosed as a 4-fold rise in HI titers with a convalescent titer > 1:40, 
      and/or the RT-PCR between the ID group (5.3%) and the IM group (8.1%) were not 
      significantly different. The reduced-dose intradermal influenza vaccine may expand 
      vaccine coverage in cases of vaccine shortage.

AB  - Two previously well Caucasian teenage girls with no significant travel or family 
      history were admitted with sinusitis refractory to treatment with antibiotics. Both 
      had progressive symptoms despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and developed 
      involvement of other systems, ultimately requiring admission to the paediatric 
      intensive care unit (PICU). They were subsequently diagnosed with the same condition 
      and made an excellent recovery.The first girl, 14 years old, originally presented to 
      her general practitioner with a sore throat, nasal congestion, and fever. Despite 
      multiple courses of antibiotics over the following month she presented again 
      multiple times with progressive symptoms including epistaxis, widespread myalgia and 
      arthralgia, difficulty in breathing, haemoptysis, fatigue, and weight loss. 
      Examination on admission found minimal discharge from her right tympanic membrane, 
      ulcerated inferior turbinates with dried blood and yellow mucus in both nasal 
      cavities, swollen tonsils without exudate, and an isolated aphthous ulcer on the tip 
      of her tongue. She had small bilateral cervical lymph nodes. Examination of the 
      cardiovascular system was unremarkable but on respiratory examination there was 
      reduced air entry on the right side. Her abdomen was generally tender but soft with 
      no organomegaly. A week into her admission she developed an oxygen requirement and 
      increased work of breathing requiring intubation and ventilation.The second girl, 13 
      years old, presented to her local hospital with a 1-day history of epistaxis, right 
      ear pain, and pain and swelling to the right periorbital tissues. Again, despite 
      multiple courses of antibiotics, she had persistent symptoms and subsequently 
      developed fever, fatigue, haemoptysis, and had a syncopal episode. She was admitted 
      to her local district general hospital and, despite initial treatment, deteriorated 
      over the following 2 weeks with persistent fever, new oxygen requirement, 
      deteriorating renal function, and anaemia. She was transferred to a tertiary centre 
      for respiratory support which escalated from Optiflow, through continuous then 
      biphasic positive airway pressure, intubation and ventilation, and ultimately 
      VV-ECMO.The investigations for both patients prior to admission to PICU at our 
      centre are shown in table 1.edpract;archdischild-2020-319887v1/T1T1T1Table

TI  - Effect of antituberculosis treatment on CYP2C19 enzyme activity in genetically 
      polymorphic South Indian Tamilian population.
PG  - 607-615
LID - 10.1111/fcp.12218 [doi]
AB  - Patients on antituberculosis therapy (ATT) are more prone to drug interactions in 
      the presence of coexisting illnesses which require drug therapy. Rifampicin is a 
      pleiotropic inducer of CYP enzymes, and isoniazid is an enzyme inhibitor. Genetic 
      variations are common in the gene coding for CYP2C19 enzyme. These variations would 
      be important in predicting the individual variations in CYP2C19 activity. The 
      objectives of the study were to find the net effect of 1-month ATT on CYP2C19 enzyme 
      activity and its association with CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms. Newly diagnosed 
      tuberculosis patients (n = 125) were included in the study. Before commencing ATT, 
      they were given a single dose of omeprazole 20 mg as a probe drug for CYP2C19. Blood 
      sample was collected after 3 h to carry out phenotyping for CYP2C19 enzyme by 
      measuring omeprazole hydroxylation index (OHI) using LC-MS/MS. The phenotyping 
      procedure was repeated after 1 month of ATT. CYP2C19 genotyping was carried out by 
      PCR-RFLP method. Significant reduction in OHI was observed after 1 month of ATT in 
      all the metabolizer groups. The percentage reduction in OHI was maximum with poor 
      metabolizers, 84.1 (IQR - 74.6, 86.6), and minimum with ultra-rapid metabolizers, 
      39.6 (IQR - 12.7, 54.7). CYP2C19 enzyme induction is predominant in patients after 1 
      month of antituberculosis treatment (ATT). Genetic variations in the enzyme could 
      not clearly explain the interindividual differences in induction. There is a 
      potential risk of drug failure/adverse effect in poor metabolizers regardless of 
      their genotype after ATT.

TI  - Frequency of Rare Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Variants in Polish Patients with Chronic 
      Respiratory Disorders.
PG  - 47-53
LID - 10.1007/5584_2016_213 [doi]
AB  - The SERPINA1 gene encoding the alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) protein is highly 
      polymorphic. It is known that, apart from the most prevalent PI*S and PI*Z A1AT 
      deficiency variants, other so-called rare variants also predispose individuals to 
      severe chronic respiratory disorders such as emphysema and chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease. Our aim was to assess the frequencies of common and rare SERPINA1 
      mutations in a group of 1033 Polish patients referred for A1AT deficiency 
      diagnostics due to chronic respiratory disorders in the period of January 
      2014-September 2015. All blood samples were analyzed according to the routine 
      diagnostic protocol, including A1AT serum concentration assessment by nephelometry 
      and immune isoelectric focusing, followed by PCR genotyping and direct sequencing 
      when necessary. A total of 890 out of the 1033 samples (86 %) carried the normal 
      PI*MM genotype, whereas, in 143 samples (14 %), at least one A1AT deficiency variant 
      was detected. In 132 subjects, PI*S (2.1 %) and PI*Z (10.8 %) common deficiency 
      alleles were identified, yielding frequencies of 0.011 and 0.062, respectively. Rare 
      SERPINA1 variants were detected in nine patients: PI*F (c.739C>T) (n = 5) and PI*I 
      (c.187C>T) (n = 4). Samples from the patients with an A1AT serum concentration below 
      120 mg/dl and presenting a PI*MM-like phenotypic pattern were retrospectively 
      analyzed by direct sequencing for rare SERPINA1 mutations, revealing a 
      PI*M2Obernburg (c.514G>T) mutation in one patient and a non-pathogenic mutation 
      (c.922G>T) in another. We conclude that the deficiency PI*Z A1AT allele is 
      considerably more common in patients with chronic respiratory disorders than in the 
      general Polish population. The prevalence of the PI*F allele seems higher than in 
      other European studies.

TI  - Population-level effectiveness of PMTCT Option A on early mother-to-child (MTCT) 
      transmission of HIV in South Africa: implications for eliminating MTCT.
PG  - 020405
LID - 020405
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV (EMTCT), defined as ≤50 
      infant HIV infections per 100 000 live births, is a global priority. Since 2011 
      policies to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) shifted from 
      maternal antiretroviral (ARV) treatment or prophylaxis contingent on CD4 cell count 
      to lifelong maternal ARV treatment (cART). We sought to measure progress with early 
      (4-8 weeks postpartum) MTCT prevention and elimination, 2011-2013, at national and 
      sub-national levels in South Africa, a high antenatal HIV prevalence setting 
      ( ≈ 29%), where early MTCT was 3.5% in 2010. METHODS: Two surveys were conducted 
      (August 2011-March 2012 and October 2012-May 2013), in 580 health facilities, 
      randomly selected after two-stage probability proportional to size sampling of 
      facilities (the primary sampling unit), to provide valid national and 
      sub-national-(provincial)-level estimates. Data collectors interviewed caregivers of 
      eligible infants, reviewed patient-held charts, and collected infant dried blood 
      spots (iDBS). Confirmed positive HIV enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and positive total HIV 
      nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) indicated infant HIV exposure or 
      infection, respectively. Weighted survey analysis was conducted for each survey and 
      for the pooled data. FINDINGS: National data from 10 106 and 9120 participants were 
      analyzed (2011-12 and 2012-13 surveys respectively). Infant HIV exposure was 32.2% 
      (95% confidence interval (CI) 30.7-33.6%), in 2011-12 and 33.1% (95% CI 31.8-34.4%), 
      provincial range of 22.1-43.6% in 2012-13. MTCT was 2.7% (95% CI 2.1%-3.2%) in 
      2011-12 and 2.6% (95% CI 2.0-3.2%), provincial range of 1.9-5.4% in 2012-13. 
      HIV-infected ARV-exposed mothers had significantly lower unadjusted early MTCT (2.0% 
      [2011-12: 1.6-2.5%; 2012-13:1.5-2.6%]) compared to HIV-infected ARV-naive mothers 
      [10.2% in 2011-12 (6.5-13.8%); 9.2% in 2012-13 (5.6-12.7%)]. Pooled analyses 
      demonstrated significantly lower early MTCT among exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) 
      mothers receiving >10 weeks ARV prophylaxis or cART compared with EBF and no ARVs: 
      (2.2% [95% CI 1.25-3.09%] vs 12.2% [95% CI 4.7-19.6%], respectively); among 
      HIV-infected ARV-exposed mothers, 24.9% (95% CI 23.5-26.3%) initiated cART during or 
      before the first trimester, and their early MTCT was 1.2% (95% CI 0.6-1.7%). 
      Extrapolating these data, assuming 32% EIA positivity and 2.6% or 1.2% MTCT, 832 and 
      384 infants per 100 000 live births were HIV infected, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although we demonstrate sustained national-level PMTCT impact in a high HIV 
      prevalence setting, results are far-removed from EMTCT targets. Reducing maternal 
      HIV prevalence and treating all maternal HIV infection early are critical for 
      further progress.

TI  - Performance and operational feasibility of two diagnostic tests for 
      cryptosporidiosis in children (CRYPTO-POC): a clinical, prospective, diagnostic 
      accuracy study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidiosis is a common cause of diarrhoea in young children (aged 
      younger than 24 months) in low-resource settings but is currently challenging to 
      diagnose. Light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy with auramine-phenol staining 
      (LED-AP), recommended for tuberculosis testing, can also detect Cryptosporidium 
      species. A lateral-flow test not requiring refrigerator storage (by contrast with 
      most immunochromatographic lateral-flow assays) has also recently been developed for 
      Cryptosporidium spp detection. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and 
      operational feasibility of LED-AP and the lateral-flow test strip for 
      cryptosporidiosis in children. METHODS: We did a prospective diagnostic accuracy 
      study in two health-care facilities in Ethiopia, in a consecutive series of children 
      younger than 5 years of age with diarrhoea (three or more loose stools within the 
      previous 24 h) or dysentery (at least one loose stool with stains of blood within 
      the previous 24 h). Stool samples were tested for Cryptosporidium spp by LED-AP and 
      the lateral-flow test strip; accuracy of each test was estimated by independent and 
      blind comparison with a composite reference standard comprising quantitative 
      immunofluorescent antibody test (qIFAT), ELISA, and quantitative PCR (qPCR). 
      Quantitative cutoff values for diarrhoea-associated infection were established in an 
      embedded case-control substudy, with cases of cryptosporidiosis coming from the 15 
      districts in and around Jimma and the eight districts surrounding Serbo, and 
      community controls without diarrhoea in the previous 48 h recruited by weekly 
      frequency matching by geographical district of the household, age group, and 
      enrolment week. FINDINGS: Stool samples from 912 children with diarrhoea or 
      dysentery and 706 controls from the case-control substudy were tested between Dec 
      22, 2016, and July 6, 2018. Estimated reference-standard cutoff values for 
      cryptosporidiosis positivity were 2·3 × 10(5) DNA copies per g of wet stool for 
      qPCR, and 725 oocysts per g for qIFAT. LED-AP had a sensitivity for 
      cryptosporidiosis of 88% (95% CI 79-94; 66 of 75 samples) and a specificity of 99% 
      (98-99; 717 of 726 samples); the lateral-flow test strip had a sensitivity of 89% 
      (79-94; 63 of 71 samples) and a specificity of 99% (97-99; 626 of 635 samples). 
      INTERPRETATION: LED-AP has high sensitivity and specificity for cryptosporidiosis 
      and should be considered as a dual-use technology that can be easily integrated with 
      existing laboratory infrastructures in low-resource settings. The lateral-flow test 
      strip has similar sensitivity and specificity and provides an alternative that does 
      not require microscopy, although purchase cost of the test strip is unknown as it is 
      not yet available on the market. FUNDING: Norwegian Research Council GLOBVAC fund,

TI  - Circulating miRNA-21 and miRNA-23a Expression Signature as Potential Biomarkers for 
      Early Detection of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.
PG  - 206-215

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Lung Cancer (LC) is a major cancer killer worldwide, and 5-yr 
      survival is extremely poor (≤15%), accentuating the need for more effective 
      diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Studies have shown cell-free microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) circulating in the serum and plasma with specific expression in cancer, 
      indicating the potential of using miRNAs as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and 
      therapy. This study aimed to identify differentially-expressed two miRNAs in the 
      plasma of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients that might be a clinically 
      useful tool for lung cancer early detection. miRNA-21 is one of the most abundant 
      oncomirs. miRNA-23a functions as an oncogene in several human cancers, however, its 
      clinical value has not been investigated in NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      case-control study was conducted in Assiut University Hospital, Egypt, from 2017 to 
      2018. Plasma samples were obtained from 45 NSCLC patients. The expression level of 
      miR-21 and miRNA-23a was detected by qRT-PCR and compared to 40 healthy control 
      subjects. The relation between both miRNAs and clinicopathological parameters was 
      evaluated. RESULTS: The expression level of miR-21 and miRNA-23a was significantly 
      up-regulated (36.9 ± 18.7 vs. 1.12 ± 0.84 and 24.7 ± 19.09 vs. 1.16 ± 0.45) in NSCLC 
      compared to matched controls (P<0.0001each). There was a significant difference in 
      the level of plasma miRNA-21 and miRNA- 23a expression between the different grades 
      of the disease (P = 0.032 and P = 0.001, respectively). The plasma miRNA-21 and 
      miRNA-23a levels in the lung cancer patients with distant metastasis (n = 20) were 
      significantly higher than those in the patients without metastasis (n = 25) 
      (P<0.0001 each), the expression of miR-21 and miRNA-23a was significantly associated 
      with tumor size (P = 0.001, P = 0.0001, respectively), but not significantly related 
      to lymph node metastasis (P = 0.687 and 0.696, respectively). A positive correlation 
      was observed between miRNA-21 and miRNA-23a (r = 0.784, P<0.01), There was no 
      significant difference in the plasma miRNA-21 and miRNA-23a levels in the lung 
      cancer patients with different histopathological types. CONCLUSION: miR-21 and 
      miR-23a might play an oncogenic role in LC and is a poor prognostic factor. 
      Switching off miRNA-21 and miRNA-23a may improve the treatment of LC. Our results 
      must be verified by large-scale prospective studies with standardized methodology.

      acute respiratory distress syndrome.
PG  - 191
LID - 10.1186/1475-2875-13-191 [doi]
AB  - The association between severe malaria and Plasmodium vivax species is contentious. 
      On the Thai-Myanmar border, all pregnant women are followed systematically with 
      active weekly malaria screening. Over a 27-year period of providing antenatal care, 
      48,983 have been prospectively followed until pregnancy outcome (miscarriage or 
      delivery) and 4,298 women have had P. vivax detected at least once. Reported here is 
      the first known P. vivax-associated death amongst these women. The initial patient 
      presentation was of uncomplicated P. vivax (0.5% parasitaemia) in a term, 
      multigravida woman who responded rapidly to oral artesunate and mefloquine 
      treatment, clearing her blood stage parasites within 48 hours. The patient appeared 
      well, was ambulatory and due to be discharged but became unwell with acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring ventilation three days (67 hours) 
      into treatment. Despite induction and delivery of a stillborn foetus, ventilatory 
      requirements increased and the patient died on day 7. The patient had a low body 
      mass index. Sensitive detection with nested PCR confirmed only the presence of P. 
      vivax species and concomitant infections such as tuberculosis and human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were also ruled out. The contemporaneous treatment of 
      acute uncomplicated P. vivax and the onset of ARDS on day 3 in this patient implies 
      a possible but unconfirmed association with death in this patient. Assuming this 
      death was caused by P. vivax, the risk of ARDS-related maternal mortality in this 
      setting did not differ significantly between Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax 
      (0.24 per 1,000 (1/4,158) versus 0.23 per 1,000 (1/4,298), contrary to the increased 
      risk of maternal mortality from P. falciparum compared to P. vivax, 2.89 per 1,000 
      (12/4,158) versus 0.23 per 1,000 (1/4,298), P = 0.003.

TI  - Four-Gene Pan-African Blood Signature Predicts Progression to Tuberculosis.
PG  - 1198-1208
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201711-2340OC [doi]
AB  - Rationale: Contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) constitute an important 
      target population for preventive measures because they are at high risk of infection 
      with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and progression to disease.Objectives: We 
      investigated biosignatures with predictive ability for incident TB.Methods: In a 
      case-control study nested within the Grand Challenges 6-74 longitudinal HIV-negative 
      African cohort of exposed household contacts, we employed RNA sequencing, PCR, and 
      the pair ratio algorithm in a training/test set approach. Overall, 79 progressors 
      who developed TB between 3 and 24 months after diagnosis of index case and 328 
      matched nonprogressors who remained healthy during 24 months of follow-up were 
      investigated.Measurements and Main Results: A four-transcript signature derived from 
      samples in a South African and Gambian training set predicted progression up to two 
      years before onset of disease in blinded test set samples from South Africa, the 
      Gambia, and Ethiopia with little population-associated variability, and it was also 
      validated in an external cohort of South African adolescents with latent M. 
      tuberculosis infection. By contrast, published diagnostic or prognostic TB 
      signatures were predicted in samples from some but not all three countries, 
      indicating site-specific variability. Post hoc meta-analysis identified a single 
      gene pair, C1QC/TRAV27 (complement C1q C-chain / T-cell receptor-α variable gene 27) 
      that would consistently predict TB progression in household contacts from multiple 
      African sites but not in infected adolescents without known recent exposure 
      events.Conclusions: Collectively, we developed a simple whole blood-based PCR test 
      to predict TB in recently exposed household contacts from diverse African 
      populations. This test has potential for implementation in national TB contact 
      investigation programs.

TI  - Global paediatric pulmonology: out of Africa.
PG  - S226-8
AB  - Respiratory illness is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in African 
      children. The spectrum of disease includes acute and chronic respiratory illness. As 
      a result of the HIV epidemic currently occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, 
      HIV-associated acute and chronic respiratory disease has emerged as a major factor 
      in the epidemiology of childhood respiratory illness. Pneumonia is the leading 
      causes of childhood mortality responsible for approximately 21% of deaths in African 
      children under five years of age each year. The HIV pandemic has increased the 
      incidence, severity and pneumonia mortality in African children. Pulmonary 
      tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of morbidity and death. Globally, the 
      highest TB incidence rates occur in sub-Saharan African countries; many of these 
      countries are also experiencing a dual HIV epidemic, resulting in an exponential 
      increase in TB cases. The burden of childhood respiratory illness has necessitated 
      novel and improved ways of diagnosis, treatment and prevention, particularly in the 
      context of limited resources. Improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention of 
      pneumonia have been a research focus, particularly in HIV-infected children. African 
      studies have provided information on the epidemiology, aetiology and outcome from 
      pneumonia in HIV-infected and uninfected children. The efficacy of 
      trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis in reducing mortality and morbidity in 
      HIV-infected African children was shown in the only randomized controlled trial. Two 
      large studies have shown the efficacy of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in an 
      African context. Regarding TB, areas of research include diagnostic studies and 
      improved preventative strategies. Promising diagnostic studies for childhood TB 
      include the use of sputum induction, PCR techniques and blood interferon assays. The 
      immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) has emerged as a new clinical 
      entity in HIV-infected children with TB associated with use of antiretroviral 
      therapy. New preventative strategies for TB include novel vaccines and primary 
      prophylaxis. Available, effective interventions for prevention and treatment of 
      childhood respiratory disease exist; the challenge is to achieve widespread 
      implementation and high coverage rates in African countries. Greater access to newer 
      vaccines and, in HIV-infected children, to anti-retroviral therapy and prophylaxis 
      is necessary to further reduce the burden of childhood respiratory illness in 
      Africa.

TI  - Reappraisal of Frequency of Common Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance 
      Regulator Gene Mutations in Iranian Cystic Fibrosis Patients.
PG  - 73-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening recessive genetic disorder 
      resulting from mutations in the gene encoding the fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
      regulator protein (CFTR). The CF clinical phenotype shows wide variation ranging 
      from severe disease in early childhood in those homozygous for the p.Phe508del 
      mutation to absence of the vas deferens in otherwise healthy men homozygous for the 
      p.Arg117His mutation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from whole blood from 
      62 patients with CF. The CFTR mutation was determined by Allele-Specific PCR assay. 
      The spearman and linear regression analysis were used to obtain the correlation 
      between phenotype and genotype relationship. RESULTS: Out of total 62 patients, 35 
      (56.4%) were male. The mean age of the patients was 15.56 ± 6.65 years. Mutations in 
      CFTR were detected in 64.5% of the patients. The commonest mutations were 
      p.Phe508del (33.9%), p.Arg117His; [5T] (5.64%), p.Arg117His; [7T] (4.03%) and 
      p.Trp1282X (5.64%). Mutations p.Ile507del (4%), p.Gly542X (4%), p.Asn1303Lys 
      (2.42%), c.489+1G>T (1.6%), p.Gly551Asp (1.6%) and c.1585-1G>A (1.6%) were also 
      detected. Most mutations were detected in west and south of Iran, while p.Phe508del 
      mutation was dominant mutation (75%) in east and southeast of Iran. The study showed 
      either an association between this mutation with severity of disease and sex or an 
      association between p.Arg117His mutations and age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The 
      geographic distribution of gene mutation in Iranian cystic fibrosis patients was 
      very heterogenic. In spite of the study that showed a correlation between 
      p.Phe508del and severity of disease, to find any correlation between genotype and 
      phenotype a broad and multi-centered study is recommended.

TI  - Persistence of Zika Virus in Body Fluids - Final Report.
PG  - 1234-1243
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1613108 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To estimate the frequency and duration of detectable Zika virus (ZIKV) 
      RNA in human body fluids, we prospectively assessed a cohort of newly infected 
      participants in Puerto Rico. METHODS: We evaluated samples obtained from 150 
      participants (including 55 men) in whom ZIKV RNA was detected on 
      reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay in urine or blood in 
      an enhanced arboviral clinical surveillance site. We collected serum, urine, saliva, 
      semen, and vaginal secretions weekly for the first month and then at 2, 4, and 6 
      months. All specimens were tested by means of RT-PCR, and serum was tested with the 
      use of anti-ZIKV IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among the participants with 
      ZIKV RNA in any specimen at week 4, biweekly collection continued until all 
      specimens tested negative. We used parametric Weibull regression models to estimate 
      the time until the loss of ZIKV RNA detection in each body fluid and reported the 
      findings in medians and 95th percentiles. RESULTS: The medians and 95th percentiles 
      for the time until the loss of ZIKV RNA detection were 14 days (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 11 to 17) and 54 days (95% CI, 43 to 64), respectively, in serum; 8 
      days (95% CI, 6 to 10) and 39 days (95% CI, 31 to 47) in urine; and 34 days (95% CI, 
      28 to 41) and 81 days (95% CI, 64 to 98) in semen. Few participants had detectable 
      ZIKV RNA in saliva or vaginal secretions. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged time until ZIKV 
      RNA clearance in serum in this study may have implications for the diagnosis and 
      prevention of ZIKV infection. Current sexual-prevention guidelines recommend that 
      men use condoms or abstain from sex for 6 months after ZIKV exposure; in 95% of the 
      men in this study, ZIKV RNA was cleared from semen after about 3 months. (Funded by 
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.).

TI  - miR-155, miR-191, and miR-494 as diagnostic biomarkers for oral squamous cell 
      carcinoma and the effects of Avastin on these biomarkers.
PG  - 341-347

AB  - OBJECTIVES: : Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common types of 
      head and neck cancer. MicroRNAs, as new biomarkers, are recommended for diagnosis 
      and treatment of different types of cancers. Bevacizumab, sold under the trade name 
      Avastin, is a humanized whole monoclonal antibody that targets and blocks VEGF-A 
      (vascular endothelial growth factor A; angiogenesis) and oncogenic signaling 
      pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study comprised 50 cases suffering from OSCC 
      and 50 healthy participants. Peripheral blood samples were collected in glass test 
      tubes, and RNA extraction was started immediately. Expression levels of miR-155, 
      miR-191, and miR-494 biomarkers in the peripheral blood of OSCC-affected individuals 
      and healthy volunteers in vivo were evaluated using real-time PCR. The influence of 
      Avastin on the expression levels of the aforementioned biomarkers in vitro and in 
      the HN5 cell line was also investigated. RESULTS: Expression levels of miR-155, 
      miR-191, and miR-494 in the peripheral blood of individuals affected by OSCC were 
      higher than in those who were healthy. Moreover, Avastin at a concentration of 400 
      μM caused a decrease in the expression levels of the three biomarkers and a 
      1.5-fold, 3.5-fold, and 4-fold increase in apoptosis in the test samples compared to 
      the controls in the HN5 cell line after 24, 48, and 72 hours, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: The findings of this study demonstrate that overexpression of miR-155, 
      miR-191, and miR-494 is associated with OSCC, and Avastin is able to regulate and 
      downregulate the expression of those biomarkers and increase apoptosis in cancerous 
      cells in the HN5 cell line.
