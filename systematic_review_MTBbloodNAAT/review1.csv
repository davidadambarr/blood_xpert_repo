We have previously used a PCR to detect circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in blood samples from patients (mostly HIV-infected) with pulmonary tuberculosis. We have now prospectively investigated the role of this blood-based PCR assay for diagnosis of this disease in a clinical setting. METHODS: Our PCR assay is specific for the IS6110 insertion element of the M tuberculosis complex of organisms. We used it to test peripheral blood from 88 consecutive patients admitted to a chest ward with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Personnel who carried out the assay did not know the results of any clinical investigations and ultimate diagnosis, and clinicians did not know the PCR results. Results of the PCR assay were compared with the final clinical diagnosis. A subgroup of 15 patients had blood samples assayed serially to track the PCR signal over time. FINDINGS: 41 patients had a final clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis, and the cases were typical of those seen at our hospital: HIV infection was common, and most cases were not sputum-smear positive for acid-fast bacilli. The PCR assay correctly identified 39 of 41 patients with proven pulmonary tuberculosis, 26 (63%) of whom were sputum-smear negative. There were five patients in whom a positive PCR result did not accord with the final clinical diagnosis, and two of the 44 negative PCR results were classified as false negatives. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay for a diagnosis of tuberculosis was 95% and 89%, respectively. In 15 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and a positive blood assay,the PCR result remained positive after 1 month of therapy, but had reverted to negative in 13 of the 15 by 4 months of therapy. INTERPRETATION: We conclude that peripheral-blood-based PCR detection for the diagnosis of tuberculosis is a technically feasible approach that has a potentially important role in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.",1,,cohort,suspected pulmonary,suspected PTB,suspected pulmonary TB but sputum culture negative and alternative diagnosis made,in house IS6110 pcr,2,buffy coat extraction,88,41,inpatient,0.43,adult,0.95,0.89,,,,,,0.95,,,low,USA,no,

At present, the diagnosis of TB depends on the detection of either mycobacteria or mycobacterial products from clinical specimens. Given the risks posed to both the patient and health care providers by undiagnosed and/or untreated TB, the ability to diagnose TB rapidly in the ICU cannot be understated. In this regard, nucleic acid amplification tests provide relatively quick information about the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) DNA. If available, a blood-based test that would accurately identify persons with TB would be of use in the ICU. Currently available tests such as the T-Spot.TB or QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube can discern infection with Mtb, but are not recommended for the ICU as they cannot rule out TB. In this review, we will discuss the increasing literature that would suggest that a blood-based diagnostic that reflects the host response to TB could be used to diagnose TB in the ICU.",0,review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical diagnostic procedure for TB is time-consuming and laborious. In the last 20 years, real-time fluorescence-based quantitative PCR (real-time PCR) has become a better alternative for TB diagnosis in clinics due to its sensitivity and specificity. Recently, digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) has been developed, and it might be an ideal alternative to conventional real-time PCR for microorganism detection. In this study, we aimed to assess the capacity of ddPCR and real-time PCR for detecting low levels of circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA. The study involved testing whole blood samples for an MTB DNA target (known as IS6110). Blood samples were obtained from 28 patients with pulmonary TB, 28 patients with extrapulmonary TB, and 28 healthy individuals. The results show that ddPCR could be used to measure low levels of MTB DNA, and it has the potential to be used to diagnose pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB based on clinical samples.",1,,case-control,confirmed PTB and EPTB,diagnosed PTB and EPTB,healthy controls,"QX100 Droplet Digital PCR System(Bio-Rad, California, USA) IS6110",0.2,DNA extraction protocol direct on whole blood,84,56,unclear,unclear,adult,1,1,,,,,,1,,1,high,China,no,

We developed a simple and efficient DNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocol for mycobacterial detection and quantification in paucibacillary specimens. The method was refined using an in vitro model mimicking blood specimens which are characterized by the presence of numerous qPCR inhibitors. Mycobacterial DNA detection in blood is of interest given the high sensitivity we previously reported using conventional PCR in blood of patients with tuberculosis lymphadenitis. Mechanical lysis of mycobacteria in the presence of an organic solvent provided the highest sensitivity. Mycobacterial DNA amplification was compromised when the human:bacterial genome ratio was at least 190:1. Separation of the specimen into bacterial- and host-rich fractions prior to DNA extraction improved mycobacterial DNA detection by 30%. Preliminary testing of our protocol in smear-negative, culture-positive specimens (gastric and lymph node aspirates, pleural and cerebrospinal fluid, and blood) confirmed the applicability of our technique to a range of paucibacillary specimens for the detection, quantification and speciation (M. tuberculosis versus M. avium) of mycobacteria, several weeks before culture results were available. Our protocol provides a novel, efficient and simple strategy to improve the performance of qPCR in paucibacillary specimens, including those with excess human DNA background. This tool is useful to study the pathophysiology of early pulmonary or occult tuberculosis, and for more rapid and accurate diagnosis in difficult to diagnose infections.  2006 Elsevier B.V.

Failure to accurately identify cases of active MTB has serious effects on both patients and the community. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear has poor sensitivity and culture methods have a delay ranging from 1 to 8 weeks for diagnosis. Nucleic acid amplification assays may be suitable candidates for this purpose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, we evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in 190 patients with pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis whom were admitted to Tehran Imam Khomeini hospitals during 2006-2010. Three ml citrated blood samples were obtained from cases. DNA extraction was performed by QIAGEN commercial kit and PCR performed with IS1081 Primer. RESULTS: Fifty six cases had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and 134 were pulmonary. Overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 41.1% and 95.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MTB-PCR assay on PBMC using IS1081 primer has a low sensitivity and now can not use as a single or alternative diagnostic test for tuberculosis. However, with regard to its high specificity can use for help diagnosing of TB in cases have no enough sputum (or other specimens) to examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture.",1,,case-control,Patients with confirmed PTB or EPTB admitted to hospital,diagnosed PTB or EPTB,healthy persons,(in house?)

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is presently seen as a promising alternative to conventional smear microscopy and culture techniques. Undiagnosed fever is a condition where the aetiology could include tuberculosis in a significant percentage. This paper evaluates a nested PCR (nPCR) using Hotstar Taq for the detection of M. tuberculosis in patients with febrile illness using insertion element, IS6110 as a target. Material and Methods: A total of 355 samples (301 HIV status unknown and 54 HIV seropositives) from patients primarily with febrile illness were tested for the presence of M. tuberculosis. Blood culture was done in a commercial automated blood culture system and nPCR in DNA extracts from buffy coat samples. Hotstar Taq polymerase was used to enhance the sensitivity of nPCR and the lower limit of detection was determined by using cloned plasmid. Results: Among the patients tested, 2% were positive by automated culture system and 6.8% of patients were positive by nPCR. Majority of the positives were from HIV seropositive individuals. The sensitivity of the nPCR was 100% and the specificity was 95.1%. The lower limit of detection was less than 1 genome copy per microlitre. Among the nPCR positives, patients from rural community were significantly higher than from the peri-urban community. Conclusions: The nPCR had a high sensitivity and specificity on buffy coat samples using Hotstar Taq polymerase in the reaction mix.

Since, the infection rate with this bacteria increasing and one of the reasons for this increase is long process of laboratory identification, therefore establishing new diagnosis methods could decrease disease rate. To achieve this aim, collected sputum and blood specimens from 50 patients with clinical suspicion of pulmonary tuberculosis were studied with both traditional, acid-fast stain (AFB) and culture method compare to Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) (IgG and IgM) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods. The sensitivity and specificity of all methods were determined by using the PCR results as the gold standard.

STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from January 2001 to December 2010. METHODOLOGY: Different clinical specimens received for Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR were dealt during the study period. Contaminated samples like sputum were processed by the standard N-acetyl L-cysteine (NALC)-NaOH method. PCR protocols were followed as per manufacturer's manual. PCR was performed using a Thermal Cycler (Master Cycler, Eppendorf, Germany): an initial denaturation step at 94C for 3 minutes was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94C for 30 seconds, annealing at 60C for 30 seconds and extension at 72C for 30 seconds and a final extension at 72C for 7 minutes. The products were held at 4C and later run on 1% agarose gel, stained with Ethidium bromide and visualized in ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator. RESULTS: Out of a total 4620 samples for PCR, 299 were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6.5%). The percentage of samples from male patients were 63.2%. The mean age of patients was 38+11.5 years. Blood was the most frequent specimen received for PCR (46.66%), followed by body fluids (18.41%) and CSF (10.64%). Yield for different clinical samples was 63/471 for sputum (13.4%), 3/29 for endobronchial washings (10.3%), 59/851 for body fluids (6.9%) and 24/400 for urine (6%). Positive yield from blood was the lowest (101/2156, 4.7%).

We have improved our previously reported PCR based on the amplification of a fragment of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex-specific insertion element IS6110 with respect to both problems. False-positive reactions caused by amplicon contamination were prevented by the use of uracil-N-glycosylase and dUTP instead of dTTP. We selected a new set of primers outside the region spanned by the formerly used primers to avoid false-positive reactions caused by dTTP-containing amplicons still present in the laboratory. With this new primer set, 16 copies of the IS6110 insertion element, the equivalent of two bacteria, could be amplified 10(10) times in 40 cycles, resulting in a mean efficiency of 77% per cycle. To detect the presence of inhibitors of the Taq polymerase, which may cause false-negative reactions, part of each sample was spiked with M. tuberculosis DNA. The DNA purification method using guanidinium thiocyanate and diatoms effectively removed most or all inhibitors of the PCR. However, this was not suitable for blood samples, for which we developed a proteinase K treatment followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. This method permitted detection of 20 M. tuberculosis bacteria per ml of whole blood. Various laboratory procedures were introduced to reduce failure or inhibition of PCR and avoid DNA cross contamination. We have tested 218 different clinical specimens obtained from patients suspected of having tuberculosis. The samples included sputum (n=145), tissue biopsy samples (n=25), cerebrospinal fluid (n=15), blood (n=14), pleural fluid (n=9), feces, (n=7), fluid from fistulae (n=2), and pus from a wound (n=1).

M. tuberculosis DNA was detected with the PCR technique in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 9 of 11 (82%) HIV-infected patients and in 7 of 21 (33%) HIV-negative patients (P < 0.01), while M. tuberculosis blood cultures were positive in 1 of 8 (12.5%) and 1 of 18 (5.5%) patients, respectively. PCR was positive in all cases with disseminated disease in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients and also in the HIV-positive patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Seven samples from patients with documented illness other than tuberculosis and 12 specimens from healthy volunteers, including seven volunteers with a recent positive purified protein derivative test, were used as controls and had a negative PCR. These results suggest that detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may be a useful tool for rapid diagnosis of disseminated and extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis, especially in an HIV-positive population.",1,,case-control,Patients admitted to hospital with high suspicion of disseminated or localised tuberculosis,suspected disseminated TB,Patients with alternative diagnosis and healthy volunteers,in house IS6110 pcr,5,PBMC isolation,38,32,inpatient,0.4,adult,0.5,1,13,11,0.82,1,10,0.2,22,0.64,high,Spain,yes,

In this test, a 245-bp sequence of the insertion element IS986 was amplified and detected by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide and by Southern blot and dot blot hybridization by using a 188-bp digoxigenin-labeled probe. We tested clinical specimens from 227 patients suspected of having tuberculosis. These included 102 cerebrospinal fluid, 48 sputum, 18 pleural fluid, 5 bronchoalveolar lavage, 18 blood, 7 pus, 8 bone marrow, and 6 urine samples and 15 tissue biopsy specimens. We also tested sputum samples from 75 patients with diseases other than tuberculosis. Sputum samples were first decontaminated, and all samples were treated with proteinase K-detergent solution to extract the DNA. Part of each sample was spiked with M. tuberculosis to provide a semiquantitative assay and to control for the loss of mycobacteria or interference with the PCR which may cause false-negative results. One femtogram of M. tuberculosis DNA could be detected. PCR was positive for all 32 culture-positive (for M. tuberculosis) and Ziehl-Neelsen staining (ZN)-positive samples, 10 of 12 culture-positive and ZN-negative samples, and all 4 culture-negative and ZN-positive samples.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a benzyl-alcohol guanidine hydrochloride (DNA extraction) method (GuHClM) on blood samples. DESIGN: GuHClM was evaluated in quantitatively spiked blood samples with M. tuberculosis. We assessed the insertion sequence (IS) 6110 region of M. tuberculosis to evaluate the efficacy of the method. The method was also applied on 102 clinical samples of suspected tuberculosis (TB) individuals and compared with smear microscopy of sputum specimens and the results of cultures. RESULTS: This method reproducibly detected as low as 4-6 bacilli. Of 102 clinical samples, 84 were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative, while 18 were HIV-positive. Among the HIV-negative individuals, 58.3% were TB-positive using PCR, while respectively 47.6% and 45.2% were sputum- and culture-positive. Among the HIV-positive individuals, 55.6% were PCR-positive, whereas only 38.9% were sputum-positive and 50% were culture-positive. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the identification of mycobacteria by PCR using GuHClM is very sensitive and therefore may have wide utility in the diagnosis of TB.",0,Reference standard unclear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-five samples from 145 clinically suspected cases of tuberculosis were processed for the detection of Mycobacterial infections by ZN (Ziehl Neelsen) smear examination, L-J & BACTEC MGIT-960 culture and multiplex PCR tests. The multiplex PCR comprised of genus-specific primers targeting hsp65 gene, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex-specific primer targeting cfp10 (Rv3875, esxB) region and Mycobacterium avium complex-specific primer pairs targeting 16S-23S Internal Transcribed Spacer sequences. The multiplex PCR developed had an analytical sensitivity of 10 fg (3-4 cells) of mycobacterial DNA. The multiplex PCR test showed the highest (77.24%) detection rate, while ZN smear examination had the lowest (20%) detection rate, which was bettered by L-J culture (34.4%) and BACTEC MGIT-960 culture (50.34%) methods. The mean isolation time for M. tuberculosis was 19.03 days in L-J culture and 8.7 days in BACTEC MGIT-960 culture. Using the multiplex PCR, we could establish M. tuberculosis + M. avium co-infection in 1.3% HIV-negative and 2.9% HIV-positive patients. The multiplex PCR was also highly useful in diagnosing mycobacteraemia in 38.09% HIV-positive and 15.38% HIV-negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: The developed in-house multiplex PCR could identify and differentiate the M. tuberculosis and M. avium complexes from other Mycobacterial species directly from clinical specimens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The triplex PCR developed by us could be used to detect and differentiate M. tuberculosis, M. avium and other mycobacteria in a single reaction tube.",0,Unclear how patients were selected for blood PCR,case-control,Patiemts referred to tertiary care clinic with suspected tuberculosis?,suspected TB,,,7.5,PBMC isolation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective analytical study. SETTING: The patients were recruited, managed and followed at the lymphodenopathy clinic, Central Police Hospital, Burr, Khartoum, Sudan. SUBJECTS: Fifty two sequential patients were enrolled. Thirty patients with FNAC diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis and positive PCR for M. tuberculosis complex had a mean age of 26.9 +/- 11.2 years and similar male, female affection. Nine patients with FNAC tuberculous lymphadenitis, but negative PCR had a slightly higher mean age (32.6 +/- 18.2 years) with similar male: female proportions. Patients with reactive lymphadenopathy (9/52) were older than patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis with a mean age of 45 +/- 24.6 years. RESULTS: None of the patients were positive for HIV or had clinical or radiological evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected in the blood samples of 30/39 (77%) patients with tuberculous lymphadenitis, but in none of the cases with reactive or malignant lymphadenopathy. The presence of M. tuberculosis DNA correlated strongly to multiple lymph-node involvement [OR (odds ratio) = 96.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 9.0 - 1,039] and to caseating-granulomatous and predominantly necrotic cytomorphological categories [OR = 70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.0 - 703].

By using nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, one may be able to diagnose, the disease on the day of arrival of specimen in the laboratory. For diagnosis of tuberculosis by direct methods like PCR, specimens from site of infection are required. In certain cases it is difficult to get the specimens from site of infection and in such situations; some researchers have tried to detect the DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from blood of these patients. The purposive of this study is to determine the diagnostic efficacy of peripheral blood-based polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: This was a simple descriptive study, carried out in Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi from Jan 2004 to Dec 2004. Sputum and blood samples were collected from 96 suspected patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum samples processed for ZN staining and AFB culture (gold standard) and blood samples processed for PCR. RESULTS: Out of 96 cases, 60 (62.5%) were culture positive. PCR was positive in 14 (14.5%). AFB smear positive were 34 (35.4%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 20% and 94.4% respectively and the positive and negative predictive values were 85.71% and 41.46% respectively. The overall efficiency of the test was 47.91%. CONCLUSION: Due to low sensitivity; a negative PCR assay does not rule the disease. However, this test may be helpful in cases where specimens from the site of infection are not available.",1,,cohort,Patients referred to tertiary care clinic with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis,suspected PTB,Pateints with negative sputum investigations for PTB,AcuGen commercial PCR kit IS6110,3,DNA extraction protocol direct on whole blood,96,60,unclear,unclear,adult,0.2,0.94,,,,,60,0.2,,,high,India,no,

The inadequate sensitivity of Ziehl-Neelsen staining and its inability to distinguish atypical mycobacteria delays accurate diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of TB in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blood and extra-pulmonary samples from patients with AIDS and pulmonary infiltrates. DESIGN: Specimens from 103 HIV-1-infected patients were prospectively analysed using bacteriological methods and IS6110-PCR. Smear-positive samples were also tested using 16S ribosomal-DNA-PCR to identify Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. Gold standard diagnosis relied on positive cultures or treatment outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients exhibited TB, one TB and MAC and four MAC. The sensitivity of IS6110-PCR was 100% in smear-positive samples, 81.8% in smear-negative BAL, 66.7% in extra-pulmonary samples and 42.9% in blood. Its specificity was 97.1% in BAL and 100% in extra-pulmonary and blood specimens. The 16S rDNA-PCR identified M. avium from all smear-positive samples that grew MAC.

The result of M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in sputum, ascitic fluid, CSF and urine samples were found to be similar in both the primers used. It is suggested that, M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in blood samples using MPB64 primers sometime gives false positive result and therefore, may not be recommended for blood samples.

Using culture results as standard, the sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of the PCR were, respectively, 97.9%, 100%, 100% and 94.4% for smear-positive respiratory specimens, 68.8%, 99.2%, 87.5% and 97.5% for smear-negative respiratory samples, 57.8%, 98.6%, 78.8% and 96.4% for all non-respiratory specimens, and 42.4%, 98.6%, 66.7% and 96.4% for smear-negative non-respiratory specimens. 154 cerebrospinal fluid samples were analysed and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 55.6%, 97.2%, 55.6% and 97.2%, respectively. These results indicate that the Cobas Amplicor MTB test enables detection of tuberculosis in respiratory specimens, but does not perform well enough in non-respiratory specimens.

Conventional methods are of limited use in diagnosing this form of the disease. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has emerged as a sensitive and specific tool for documenting the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical samples but lacks quantitative ability. The present study evaluates peripheral blood as an alternative clinical specimen for diagnosing EPTB. Peripheral blood samples from 38 EPTB and 89 non tuberculous subjects were analyzed for the presence of tubercle bacilli by MPB 64 gene based PCR method. The assay gave an overall sensitivity of 60.53% with negative predictive value of 76.92% which is superior to present gold standard of mycobacterial culture (10.53 and 72.36%). Additionally, 43.82% of non tuberculous subjects gave positive results with the PCR, thus mitigating the clinical utility of this test.

METHODS: Detection of the M. tuberculosis complex in blood samples using as a target the insertion sequence IS6110 of the genomic DNA of the bacillus. Blood samples of 120 patients were evaluated. All of the patients were under 15 years of age at the time of their treatment at public hospitals in the city of Recife, Brazil (between January of 2003 and August of 2005). Attending physicians at the hospitals diagnosed TB based on the criteria recommended by the American Thoracic Society. The nPCR amplified a 123-bp fragment with outer oligonucleotides (IS1/IS2) and, in the subsequent reaction, using inner oligonucleotides (IS3/IS4), generating an 81-bp amplicon. RESULTS: Active or latent TB was found in 65 patients, TB was ruled out in 28 suspected cases, and 27 patients were TB-free (controls). The sensitivity of nPCR was 26.15% and was significantly higher for the extrapulmonary form of the disease (55.56%) than for the pulmonary form (18.18%). The specificity was 92.73%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the difficulties in diagnosing TB in children and the low number of cases evaluated in the present study, nPCR in blood samples proved to be a rapid and specific technique, albeit one with low sensitivity.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical relevance of detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. DESIGN: Single-centre prospective case study of 90 hospitalised patients and 50 healthy subjects or blood donors from 1 January to 30 June 1998. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis (26.7%); 20 tuberculosis patients were culture-positive, with seven smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli. Sensitivity of smear, culture and nested PCR was 30.4 (7/23), 87 (20/23) and 30.4% (7/23), respectively. The specificity of smear and culture was 100%, and the specificity of the nested PCR was 96% in the healthy subjects. However, the specificity decreased to 83.6% in the hospitalised patients, with 11 nested PCR-positive patients without a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The sensitivity of the nested PCR was low in pulmonary tuberculosis (22.2%), but increased in pulmonary/extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (50%), extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (33%), and disseminated tuberculosis (33%). CONCLUSION: The use of a nested PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis with regard to low sensitivity and specificity. However, further studies are needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of paucibacillary forms of tuberculosis.",1,,cohort,Inpatients with suspected TB,suspected PTB or EPTB,Final diagnosis not TB,in houe nested PCR IS6110,5,PBMC isolation,90,23,inpatient,0.46,adult,0.26,0.84,41,6,0.33,0.83,9,0.22,14,0.36,high,France,pbmc culture in subset,

Results from the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay were compared with those from culture and the final clinical diagnosis for each patient. A total of 526 nonrespiratory specimens from 492 patients were tested. The specimens included urine; feces; lymph node exudates; pleural, cerebrospinal, articular, and ascitic fluids; tissue biopsies; gastric aspirates; purulent exudates; blood; and bone marrow aspirates. After combination of the culture results and the patient's clinical data, a total of 135 specimens were collected from 122 patients with a diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay were 77.7, 98.7, 95.2, and 93.1%, respectively; these values rose in resolved cases of TB to 78.5, 100, 100, and 93.1%, respectively. For 37 (27.4%) specimens from patients smear positive for the disease and 98 (72.6%) specimens from patients smear negative for the disease, the sensitivities of the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay were 100 and 71.1%, respectively. Statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) in sensitivities were found between culture and the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay. These differences were even greater among smear-negative specimens. The results demonstrate that the LCx M. tuberculosis Assay will provide rapid and valuable information for the diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculosis.",0,unclear how subgroup who got blood PCR were selected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a IS6110-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method can be utilized to detect M. tuberculosis in non-pulmonary specimens. DESIGN: Specimens from 286 Mexican patients with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of EPTB were prospectively examined by Ziehl-Neelsen staining, mycobacterial culture on Lwenstein-Jensen slants, and by PCR. The DNA for PCR was extracted by the buffer lysis method and phenol-guanidine thiocyanate-chloroform. Primers that amplify a 200 bp fragment from the insertion-like M. tuberculosis sequence element IS6110 were utilized. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that this PCR method is highly specific (100%) for identifying M. tuberculosis from a variety of specimens including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, and lymph node exudate. Moreover, the sensitivity of PCR for detecting M. tuberculosis in CSF (94%), pleural fluid (94%), ascitic fluid and other extrapulmonary specimens (93%) greatly exceeds the sensitivity of conventional smear and culture methods. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that PCR can be a highly specific and sensitive aid in the detection of M. tuberculosis from extra-pulmonary specimens.",0,PCR not done on blood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) constitutes the main cause of classic fever of unknown origin (FUO) in many populations. The aim of this study was to improve the diagnostic field of the disease using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, specific for the IS6110 insertion element of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, in order to achieve a more timely diagnosis and treatment. Setting. Twenty-four, HIV-negative classic FUO patients who were admitted to the Regional Hospital of Alexandroupolis between April 1997 and July 1999. Subjects and design. The above patients were considered as putative extrapulmonary TB after 3 weeks of in-patient investigation and underwent exhaustive examination for diagnosis of the disease. For this purpose, specimens were obtained from peripheral blood and bone marrow from these patients, as well as from damaged tissues, and analysed by both PCR and conventional methods. Anti-tuberculous treatment was initiated in 16 out of 24 patients and the response to this regimen was considered as the final criterion for diagnosis of tuberculosis. Results. Extrapulmonary TB was established in 11 patients. The PCR-based methodology, when applied to samples derived from bone marrow aspirations and suspected damaged tissues, was able to diagnose 10 of them, whereas the conventional methods were able to detect only two. Conclusions. Our results confirm the diagnostic value of molecular detection of M. tuberculosis in cases of FUO, thus supporting the application of PCR in tissue samples suspected of bacillus infection. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that bone marrow aspiration specimens constitute an alternative, easy, safe and reliable source for such PCR analysis.",0,Unclear reference standard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we have evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in adult patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative and new cases of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. We investigated the relationship between characteristic of the patients, radiological extension of the disease, sputum smear grade, presence of cavity, body-mass index (BMI), serum albumin level, total delay time and PCR positivity. Forty patients (33 male and 7 female; mean age 37.814.1) and 20 healthy control subjects (13 male and 7 female; mean age 35.67.3) were enrolled in this study. PCR was positive in 16 of 40 (40%) patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and negative in 24 of 40 (60%). None of the healthy controls had positive PCR results. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the PCR assay was 40,100 and 60%, respectively. We found the positive correlation between PCR positivity and sputum smear grade (r= 0.46, P=0.003), radiological extension of the disease (r= 0.69, P=0.001), presence of cavity (r= 0.90, P=0.001). We conclude that the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA from peripheral blood by PCR technique is useful for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis patients with HIV-negative. Hematogenous dissemination was important in tuberculosis patients and peripheral blood samples were suitable and easy materials. However, standardization of the PCR method must be ensured for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.  2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The authors report the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA in specimens from six patients using a nested PCR protocol specific for IS6110 insertion element of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Three men and three women are reported with ages ranging from 42 to 68 years. The sites of infection were the knee and shoulder in one case each, the hip in two cases, and the thoracic spine in two cases.

The studies have shown that it is expedient to concurrently determine MBT DNA and MBT AT in order to identify local forms of tuberculosis in children from risk groups. If the tests are positive, a comprehensive examination for tuberculosis is required; the presence of the syndrome of common disturbances is generally associated with tuberculous infection. When a local form of tuberculosis is excluded, preventive chemotherapy should be performed. Further negative tests for MBT DNA and lower MBT AT may be a criterion for the efficiency of preventive treatment. In children with tuberculosis, the results of repeated blood and urine tests for MBT DNA provide a way of evaluating the course of a tuberculous process and the efficiency of chemotherapy.

All smear positive samples were PCR positive except for 7/138 (5.07%) that were false negative because of the presence of inhibitors. However, the use of several samples for each patient minimize the false negative results.

Samples of pulmonary, extrapulmonary and blood origin were collected prospectively from 331 patients. All samples were processed to detect acid-fast bacilli by direct stain, culture and PCR. The gold standard comparison was a clinically based final case definition of tuberculosis corresponding to group 3 of the American Thoracic Society's classification system. The sensitivities of stain, culture and PCR were 41%, 65% and 59%, respectively. Overall specificity exceeded 97% for all techniques. The combination of PCR and direct stain achieved a sensitivity similar to that of culture alone. The PCR method detected 74 of 95 (78%) culture-positive results. In a hospital setting, PCR could be a useful, reliable tool for diagnosis of tuberculosis and may be introduced as a complementary routine diagnostic laboratory method.",0,unclear how subgroup who got blood PCR were selected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The specimens of sputum and peripheral blood from 168 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis, 57 patients with lung cancer and the specimens of peripheral blood from 34 healthy individuals were detected by TaqMan-PCR, PCR. The specimens of sputum were also detected by smear, culture with BACTEC and Lowenstein-Jensen for comparison. RESULTS: The positive rates of sputum and peripheral blood detected by TaqMan-PCR were 53.0% and 61.3%, respectively, significantly higher than those of PCR, smear, culture with BACTEC and Lowenstein-Jensen (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between TaqMan-PCR and PCR for specificity (P > 0.05). Of 105 specimens of peripheral blood from patients with smear-negative and culture-negative pulmonary tuberculosis, 48 specimens of peripheral blood detected by TaqMan-PCR were positive.

The PCR amplifies a part of the DNA coding for 16S rRNA with a set of primers that is specific for the genus Mycobacterium and that flanks species-specific sequences within the genes coding for 16S rRNA. The PCR product is analyzed in a reverse cross blot hybridization assay with probes specific for M. tuberculosis complex (pTub1), M. avium (pAvi3), M. intracellulare (pInt5 and pInt7), M. kansasii complex-M. scrofulaceum complex (pKan1), M. xenopi (pXen1), M. fortuitum (pFor1), M. smegmatis (pSme1), and Mycobacterium spp. (pMyc5a). The PCR assay can detect 10 fg of DNA, the equivalent of two mycobacteria. The specificities of the probes were tested with 108 mycobacterial strains (33 species) and 31 nonmycobacterial strains (of 17 genera). The probes pAvi3, pInt5, pInt7, pKan1, pXen1, and pMyc5a were specific. With probes pTub1, pFor1, and pSme1, slight cross hybridization occurred. However, the mycobacterial strains from which the cross-hybridizing PCR products were derived belonged to nonpathogenic or nonopportunistic species which do not occur in clinical samples. The test was used on 31 different clinical specimens obtained from patients suspected of having mycobacterial disease, including a patient with a double mycobacterial infection. The samples included sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tissue biopsy samples, cerebrospinal fluid, pus, peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, and blood.

Diagnostic culture, considered as the reference method, was performed with BACTEC, Lwenstein-Jensen, Stonebrink, and Kirchner media. Occasionally MB-Redox, ESP, or MGIT medium was also used. A total of 643 respiratory and 506 nonrespiratory specimens collected from 807 patients were investigated. Of the 95 culture-positive specimens, 80 were COBAS AMPLICOR MTB positive, and of the 1,054 culture-negative specimens, 1,044 were COBAS AMPLICOR MTB negative. After resolving discrepancies by review of the medical history, the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for the COBAS AMPLICOR MTB assay, respectively, were 83.5, 98.8, 86.7, and 98.6% compared to those of diagnostic culture. In smear-positive specimens, the sensitivity of the COBAS AMPLICOR MTB assay was 96%, versus 48% for smear-negative specimens. No significant differences in the test performance between respiratory and nonrespiratory specimens were observed. The overall inhibition rate was less than 2%, excluding stool specimens. The clear advantages of the COBAS AMPLICOR PCR system are standardized procedures and reagents for specimen processing as well as an internal control for reliable monitoring of PCR inhibitors.

METHODS: Twenty individuals with uveitis of presumed infectious origin were evaluated. Sixteen of them had AIDS, four were immunocompetent individuals. We also evaluated 4 normal controls who underwent vitrectomy surgery. Clinical evaluation of the patients was performed together by three clinicians. PCR evaluations of the serum, aqueous, and vitreous humor were performed in a masked fashion by the laboratory staff. RESULTS: Twelve patients had a clinical diagnosis of CMV retinitis. Of these 6 (50%) had a positive PCR for CMV in the vitreous, three (25%) had a positive PCR for CMV in the serum, and none were positive in the aqueous. Five patients had a clinical diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN). Three (60%) of these had positive PCR for HSV/VZV in the vitreous. One of these patients had a positive PCR reaction for both EBV and HSV/VZV in the vitreous samples. One patient with cutaneous herpes zoster had a positive PCR reaction for HSV/VZV in the serum. Four patients had a presumed diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis, one patient (25%) had a positive PCR for Toxoplasma gondii in the serum, 3 (75%) had positive results in the aqueous, and 2 (50%) had positive results in the vitreous. One patient with presumed ocular tuberculosis had a positive PCR reaction both in the serum and in the vitreous samples. Finally, none of the four control individuals revealed any positive PCR reaction.

The performance of the genus probe was compared with the performance of probes specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium and with that of standard culture. In addition, the utility of an internal control in monitoring amplification inhibitors was studied. Of 545 respiratory and 325 nonrespiratory specimens (a total of 870 specimens), 58 (6.7%) showed the presence of amplification inhibitors, as determined by a negative result for the internal control. Of these 58 specimens, 31 (53%) were stool specimens; other material, even titrate blood after lysis of erythrocytes, did not pose a problem with regard to inhibition of PCR amplification. Eighty-one of the remaining 812 specimens had a positive Mycobacterium culture result. Of these culture-positive specimens, 58 (71.6%) showed a positive result with the Mycobacterium genus-specific probe. Seventy-two samples had a positive result with the Mycobacterium- specific probe but a negative culture result. Of these 72 samples, 26 samples were regarded as true positive, either because the M. tuberculosis- or M. avium-specific probe was also positive at the same time or because other specimens from the same patient taken at the same time were culture positive. The sensitivity of the Mycobacterium-specific probe was 78.5% and the specificity was 93.5%. This study showed that pretesting of clinical specimens for mycobacteria to the genus level with a Mycobacterium-specific probe offers the routine clinical laboratory the possibility of detecting tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria with one test. Furthermore, specimens testing positive with the genus-specific probe can be immediately identified with species specific probes.",0,Included patients not prospectively defined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nested-PCR is a rapid technique that, even if not showing a good sensitivity, should be considered as a helpful tool especially in the extrapulmonary cases or in cases where confirmatory diagnosis is quite difficult to be achieved by routine methods. The performance of PCR-based techniques should be considered and tested in future works on other types of biological specimens besides sputum, like blood and urine, readily obtainable in most cases.

It is proposed that this simple sample processing method could be used to screen all blood samples quickly for mycobacteremia using the genus PCR and only those positive for mycobacteria need to be tested for M. tuberculosis.

Most guidelines for the diagnosis and management of TBM agree on the use of simple Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis using molecular tools like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). However, the sensitivity of PCR varies while using a CSF sample. In the present study, we have compared the diagnostic utility of PCR assay in both peripheral blood and CSF sample collected from TBM cases. AIM: To evaluate the application of the peripheral blood PCR assay as an alternate tool for TBM diagnosis compared to conventional CSF-PCR based system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 TBM patients were prospectively recruited from in patient department wards of Central India Institute of Medical Sciences (CIIMS) between January 2014 - Feburary 2015. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) specific IS6110 PCR and BactT liquid culture were performed in 20 of recruited cases classified as Stage 1, 2 and 3 based on British Medical Research Council (BMRC) contemporary clinical criteria for the severity of TBM. Clinical characteristics were summarised in terms of percentages for categorical variables, i.e., age groups, gender, signs and symptoms. All statistical analysis was carried out using MedCalc software version 11.6. RESULTS: Overall IS6110 PCR positivity in CSF was around 80% (16/20), which was higher than culture (29.3%) and peripheral blood (39%). Out of 8 positive cases, stage wise positivity of peripheral blood PCR assay in three TBM stages was 0% (stage1) 50% (stage 2) and 67% (Stage 3) respectively. Positivity of peripheral blood PCR was significantly more (86%) in patients with CSF culture/ IS6110 PCR positive for MTB infection with sensitivity and specificity of 50 and 100% respectively. Increased positivity rates of peripheral blood PCR was observed with decreased CSF/Blood sugar ratio in stage 3 cases, suggesting enhanced probability of mycobacterial blood dissemination in cases of TBM severity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that although the molecular diagnosis of TBM infection in CSF remains the method of choice, peripheral blood based PCR can be used as a good alternative to CSF in case of TBM severity where the repeated CSF collection may be needed. However, study demands further validation in large cohorts to justify the present hypothesis.",0,Unclear how included patients not prospectively defined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tuberculosis spread to almost every organ of the body and is characterized on the basis of localization of infection. Therefore, different types of body fluids and tissues can be used for the detection of MTB.From 2004 to 2010 total 766 different types of smear negative samples from patients, clinically suspected for tuberculosis were received and investigated at Division of Molecular Diagnostics, University of the Punjab Lahore for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Mycobacterial DNA was extracted followed by PCR amplification. FINDINGS: A total of 356 (46.5%) samples were found positive by PCR for MTB. These included; serum (4.8%), blood (36.3%), urine (46.6%), cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) (42.1%), ascetic fluid (67.6%), pleural fluid (52%), pericardial fluid (30%), pus (38.6%), bone marrow (60%), sputum (38.8%) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (70%). Over all there was no significant difference in males and females neither in different age groups for the identification of MTB.

This study will explore detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb) DNA in CD34 (+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a biomarker for LTBI and monitoring chemoprophylaxis response. Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 120 household contacts (60 HIV positive and 60 HIV negative) will be recruited. Also, 10 patients with sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis and 10 visitors from low incidence countries with no history of TB treatment will be recruited as positive and negative controls, respectively. Participants will donate 100 ml (50 ml for TB patients) of blood to isolate PBMCs using density gradient centrifugation. Isolated PBMCs will be separated into CD34 (+) and CD34 (-) enriched cellular fractions. DNA from each fraction will be purified, quantified and subjected to droplet digital PCR targeting IS6110 (a M.tb Complex multi-copy gene) and rpoB, a single copy gene. Also, 4 ml of blood will be drawn for IGRA. In a nested prospective study, 60 HIV positive participants will be given 300 mg of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) daily for six months, after which they will donate a second 100 ml blood sample that will be processed as described above. Data from the cross-sectional study will be analysed to determine the proportion of individuals in whom M.tb DNA is detectable in CD34 (+) and CD34 (-) fractions and number of M.tb genomes present. Data from the prospective study will be analysed to compare the proportion of individuals with detectable M.tb DNA in CD34 (+) and CD34 (-) fractions, and median M.tb genome copy number, post vs pre-IPT. Discussion: This study will determine whether detection of M.tb DNA in CD34 (+) PBMCs holds promise as a biomarker for LTBI and monitoring chemoprophylaxis response.",0,preregistration of study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current conventional techniques lack sensitivity and are time-consuming. Here, we report our experience with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (MPCR) using two targets namely IS6110 and protein antigen b in the diagnosis of extra-pulmonary TB. Materials and Methods: A total of 150 patients of extra-pulmonary TB visiting tertiary care center in north India between September 2008 and December 2009 were included in the study. Sixty-six biopsy samples and 84 were body fluids from these patients were subjected for microscopy (Ziehl-Neelsen), culture on LJ medium and for Multiplex PCR using IS6110 and Protein b antigen. Results: Smear positivity was noted in 11 samples (7.33%), and LJ culture yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 8 biopsies and 9 body fluids with overall positivity of 11.3%. The multi-targeted PCR could detect M. tuberculosis in a total of 112 samples. Of 112 positive samples, only Protein b band was detected in 7 samples and only IS6110 was detected in 5 samples. Overall Protein b, PCR could detect 71.33% of the cases, whereas IS6110 was positive in 66.6% of the cases. Overall the sensitivities of microscopy, culture, IS6110 PCR, Protein b PCR and MPCR were 7.33%, 11.3%, 66.67%, 71.3% and 74.6%, respectively. Thus by using more than two targets the sensitivity increased from 66.67% of IS6110 to 74.6% in MPCR. Conclusion: Multiplex polymerase chain reaction using IS6110 and Protein b antigen is a highly sensitive and specific tool in the diagnosis of pauci-bacillary conditions like extra-pulmonary TB.",0,Included patients not prospectively defined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 508 clinical specimens (blood 343, menstrual fluid 53, endometrial tissue 43, body fluid 36, pus from lymph nodes 18, sputum 8, urine 5 and semen 2) were included in this study. We extracted DNA using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Germany) and performed real-time assay using Rotor-Gene Q machine from Corbett Research, Australia for specific amplification of IS6110 sequence of mycobacterial genome. The RT-PCR result was also compared with bacterial culture and acid-fast bacillus staining. RT-PCR assay showed positivity in 52 cases and negative in 456 cases. Corresponding positive results in culture and acid-fast bacillus staining methods were 49 cases and 24 cases respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis by RT-PCR were 93.87% and 98.69% respectively taking positive culture results as reference standards. The overall positive and negative predictive values were 88.46% and 99.34% respectively. RT-PCR is a useful diagnostic tool for rapid and sensitive detection of mycobacteria in different clinical samples. The easy processing, fast reporting and relative lack of contamination issues make it worthy as a possible replacement to time consuming culture techniques. Moreover, it has added advantage of quantification of mycobacterial DNA, hence bacterial load.",0,Included patients not prospectively defined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine if the Xpert MTB/rifampicin (RIF) assay had additional advantages over nested PCR for the detection of MTB in a geographical area with intermediate tuberculosis (TB) incidence. Methods: Between February and December 2013, the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR, as well as AFB smear and culture, were simultaneously performed on 198 clinical samples (160 pulmonary and 38 non-pulmonary specimens) collected from 171 patients hospitalized at Hallym University Medical Center for possible TB. The accuracy of the diagnosis of MTB culture-positive TB and the turnaround time of reporting laboratory results were calculated and compared. Rifampin resistance by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay was reviewed with that of conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). Results: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR for diagnosis of MTB culture-positive pulmonary TB were 86.1% vs. 69.4% (P=0.1563), 97.8% vs. 94.1% (P=0.2173), 91.2% vs. 75.8% (P=0.1695), and 96.4% vs. 92.0% (P=0.2032), respectively. The median turnaround times of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay and MTB nested PCR were 0 [0-4] days and 4 [1-11] days, respectively (P < 0.001). Two cases of rifampin resistance, as determined by the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, were found to be multi-drug resistant (MDR) pulmonary TB by DST. Conclusions: The Xpert MTB/RIF assay seemed to be sensitive, specific, and comparable to nested PCR for identifying MTB among clinically suspected TB patients, and the assay can be valuable in giving a timely identification of resistance to rifampin.

Failure to accurately identify cases of active MTB has serious effects on both patients and the community. Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear has poor sensitivity and culture methods have a delay ranging from 1 to 8 weeks for diagnosis. Nucleic acid amplification assays may be suitable candidates for this purpose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, we evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in 190 patients with pulmonary and extra pulmonary tuberculosis whom were admitted to Tehran Imam Khomeini hospitals during 2006-2010. Three ml citrated blood samples were obtained from cases. DNA extraction was performed by QIAGEN commercial kit and PCR performed with IS1081 Primer. RESULTS: Fifty six cases had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and 134 were pulmonary. Overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 41.1% and 95.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MTB-PCR assay on PBMC using IS1081 primer has a low sensitivity and now can not use as a single or alternative diagnostic test for tuberculosis. However, with regard to its high specificity can use for help diagnosing of TB in cases have no enough sputum (or other specimens) to examination for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture.",0,duplicate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study Design: Observational study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from January 2001 to December 2010. Methodology: Different clinical specimens received for Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR were dealt during the study period. Contaminated samples like sputum were processed by the standard N-acetyl L-cysteine (NALC)-NaOH method. PCR protocols were followed as per manufacturer's manual. PCR was performed using a Thermal Cycler (Master Cycler, Eppendorf, Germany): an initial denaturation step at 94C for 3 minutes was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 94C for 30 seconds, annealing at 60C for 30 seconds and extension at 72C for 30 seconds and a final extension at 72C for 7 minutes. The products were held at 4C and later run on 1% agarose gel, stained with Ethidium bromide and visualized in ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator. Results: Out of a total 4620 samples for PCR, 299 were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6.5%). The percentage of samples from male patients were 63.2%. The mean age of patients was 38+11.5 years. Blood was the most frequent specimen received for PCR (46.66%), followed by body fluids (18.41%) and CSF (10.64%). Yield for different clinical samples was 63/471 for sputum (13.4%), 3/29 for endobronchial washings (10.3%), 59/851 for body fluids (6.9%) and 24/400 for urine (6%). Positive yield from blood was the lowest (101/2156, 4.7%).

Diagnosis can be done by imaging techniques, direct visualization by endoscopy, serology, histopathology, culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Laparoscopy detects macroscopic changes only; histology is only suggestive and not confirmatory unless acid fast bacilli (AFB) are demonstrated in the lesion but sensitivity is poor in paucibacillary disease. Culture methods are the gold standard but slow growth of most pathogenic mycobacteria delays the diagnosis. PCR can rapidly detect even few copies of DNA with high sensitivity and specificity. Aim: Comparative evaluation of AFB smear examination, culture in Middlebrook 7H9 media and IS6110 based real-time PCR assay for the detection of mycobacteria in various female genital samples. Materials and methods: A total of 555 female genital samples like endometrial and fallopian tube biopsies, menstrual blood and vaginal discharge were processed by modified Petroff's method. The deposit was used for detection of mycobacteria by AFB smear, culture on Middlebrook 7H9 media and IS6110 based real-time PCR. Results: Out of 555 samples, 25.22% (140/555) were positive by the combination of all the methods used. Overall positivity by real-time PCR alone was 23.78% (132/555), by culture 8.28% (46/555) and 2.70% (15/555) by AFB smear examination. Out of total positives, 94.28% (132/140) were positive by PCR alone, 32.85% (46/140) by culture and 10.71% (15/140) by AFB smear. Eight (5.71%) culture positive samples were negative by smear and PCR, six of these were nontubercular mycobacteria (NTM) and two samples had PCR inhibitors as confirmed by spiking with positive DNA. Contamination was observed in 25/555 (4.5%) which were reported negative by culture but three of these were PCR positive. AFB smear results were available in 1 hour, PCR in 1 day and culture in 4 to 6 weeks. Conclusion: PCR was found to be the most rapid and sensitive (94.28%) method, 9-fold more sensitive than smear examination and 3-fold than the culture for detection of mycobacteria. Results were available in 4 to 6 weeks time for culture but in only 1 day by PCR. IS6110 PCR can detect only MTB and not the NTM. Use of multiplex PCR with genus and MTB specific primers will increase the sensitivity of test but care needs to be taken to prevent false positivity due to cross contamination and false negative due to PCR inhibitors.",0,peripheral blood PCR not done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods:A study was designed to assess the diagnostic value of PCR targeted to IS 1081 in peripheral blood of HIV-infected individuals because of ease of obtaining periodic samples. A cohort of 129 individuals was recruited for this purpose. It contained of adult, non-pregnant HIV sero-positive as well as HIV sero-negative individuals who were nave to anti-Koch's treatment at two teaching hospitals in Mumbai. Results: The cohort of 129 individuals was categorized into 5 groups based on their clinical TB and HIV status. The mean CD4 count for TB+HIV+(Groups 1,2,3) ranged between 381 and 525 cells/cmm suggesting early to moderate immune suppression.TB PCR assay was compared with the 'gold' standard, namely the LJ culture in each of the 5 groups.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of a benzyl-alcohol g uanidine hydrochloride (DNA extraction) method (GuHClM) on blood samples. DESIGN: GuHClM was evaluated in quantitatively spiked blood samples with M. tuberculosis. We assessed the insertion sequence (IS) 6110 region of M. tuberculosis to evaluate the efficacy of the method. The method was also applied on 102 clinical samples of suspected tuberculosis (TB) individuals and compared with smear microscopy of sputum specimens and the results of cultures. RESULTS: This method reproducibly detected as low as 4-6 bacilli. Of 102 clinical samples, 84 were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative, while 18 were HIV-positive. Among the HIV-negative individuals, 58.3% were TB-positive using PCR, while respectively 47.6% and 45.2% were sputum- and culture-positive. Among the HIV-positive individuals, 55.6% were PCR-positive, whereas only 38.9% were sputum-positive and 50% were culture-positive. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the identification of mycobacteria by PCR using GuHClM is very sensitive and therefore may have wide utility in the diagnosis of TB.  2010 The Union.",0,duplicate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1993, the World Health Organization declared tuberculosis a global public health emergency. Conventional methods for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infections are time consuming, as MTB culture requires 3-8 weeks for growth. To determine the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), we have evaluated Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood samples with PCR technique in adults with new cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. Setting: Department of Infectious disease of Imam Khomeini Hospital, 2004-2005, Tehran, Iran. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated MTB DNA extracted from 3ml citrated peripheral blood samples from 95 adults with new cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. DNA extraction was performed using a commercial PCR kit with IS1081 primers. For prevention of cross contamination and reduction of false positives, all steps were performed under laminar hood. Results: The 95 patients, 59 of whom were male, had a mean age 44.44 years (SD20.26); 69 cases had pulmonary and 26 had extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. PCR was positive in 32 (33.7%) patients and negative in 63 (66.3%) cases. The overall sensitivity and accuracy of the PCR assay was 44.1% for pulmonary, 19.2% for extra-pulmonary and 10% for disseminated tuberculosis, respectively. Conclusion: The low sensitivity of the IS1081 primer MTB-PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. However, further studies are needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.",0,unclear if included patients prospectively defined,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Twenty-five patients with a clinical diagnosis of TBM and 49 controls, including 27 patients with other infectious diseases of central nervous system and 22 patients with noninfectious neurological diseases, were enrolled in our research. We simultaneously detected anti-mycobacterium bovis BCG IgG secreting cells in both cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood (PBL) by enzyme linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT), repeated insertion sequence IS6110 specific for mycobacterium tuberculosis in CSF by PCR and anti-BCG IgG titre in both CSF and PBL by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: The sensitivity of ELISPOT was 84.0%, much higher than that of PCR (75.0%) and ELISA (52.3%). The specificities of the three tests were 91.8%, 93.7% and 91.8% respectively. The numbers of CSF cells secreting anti-BCG IgG tested by ELISPOT were even higher in the early phase of TBM, but declined along with the disease progressing (t = -3.183, P = 0.008), which allowed an early diagnosis to be made.

Hence, techniques based on nucleic acid amplification, which are both rapid and of high specificity and sensitivity, are now widely used and recommended for laboratories that diagnose TB. In the present study, diagnostic methods based on mycobacterial DNA amplification were evaluated in comparative trials alongside tradicional bacterial methods, using negative smear samples from patients with clinically-suspected TB (sputum samples from 25 patients with suspected pulmonary TB, urine samples from two patients with suspected renal TB and cerebrospinal fluid samples from one patient with suspected meningeal TB). A specificity of 100% was achieved with DNA amplification methods and tradicional culture/identification methods, in relation to clinical findings and treatment results. For the smear-negative sputa, conventional PCR for M. tuberculosis was positive in 62% of suspected lung TB case, showing the same sensitivity as bacterial identification. Both techniques failed in the detection of extra-pulmonary samples. Nested PCR showed, after species-specific amplification, a sensitivity of 100% for M. avium and 85% for M. tuberculosis. For extra-pulmonary smear-negative samples, only Nested PCR detected M. tuberculosis and all cases were confirmed clinically.

By using nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, one may be able to diagnose, the disease on the day of arrival of specimen in the laboratory. For diagnosis of tuberculosis by direct methods like PCR, specimens from site of infection are required. In certain cases it is difficult to get the specimens from site of infection and in such situations; some researchers have tried to detect the DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex from blood of these patients. The purposive of this study is to determine the diagnostic efficacy of peripheral blood-based polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: This was a simple descriptive study, carried out in Department of Microbiology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi from Jan 2004 to Dec 2004. Sputum and blood samples were collected from 96 suspected patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. Sputum samples processed for ZN staining and AFB culture (gold standard) and blood samples processed for PCR. RESULTS: Out of 96 cases, 60 (62.5%) were culture positive. PCR was positive in 14 (14.5%). AFB smear positive were 34 (35.4%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was 20% and 94.4% respectively and the positive and negative predictive values were 85.71% and 41.46% respectively. The overall efficiency of the test was 47.91%. CONCLUSION: Due to low sensitivity; a negative PCR assay does not rule the disease. However, this test may be helpful in cases where specimens from the site of infection are not available.",0,duplicate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The result of M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in sputum, ascitic fluid, CSF and urine samples were found to be similar in both the primers used. It is suggested that, M. tuberculosis DNA PCR in blood samples using MPB64 primers sometime gives false positive result and therefore, may not be recommended for blood samples.

The inadequate sensitivity of Ziehl-Neelsen staining and its inability to distinguish atypical mycobacteria delays accurate diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of TB in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blood and extra-pulmonary samples from patients with AIDS and pulmonary infiltrates. DESIGN: Specimens from 103 HIV-1-infected patients were prospectively analysed using bacteriological methods and IS6110-PCR. Smear-positive samples were also tested using 16S ribosomal-DNA-PCR to identify Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. Gold standard diagnosis relied on positive cultures or treatment outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients exhibited TB, one TB and MAC and four MAC. The sensitivity of IS6110-PCR was 100% in smear-positive samples, 81.8% in smear-negative BAL, 66.7% in extra-pulmonary samples and 42.9% in blood. Its specificity was 97.1% in BAL and 100% in extra-pulmonary and blood specimens. The 16S rDNA-PCR identified M. avium from all smear-positive samples that grew MAC.

Here we describe a simple method for the isolation of PCR-amplifiable DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from all types of samples of pulmonary and extrapulmonary origin tested. Briefly, it involves concentration of the bacilli by high-speed centrifugation, removal of PCR inhibitors by a wash solution containing guanidinium isothiocyanate and the release of bacterial DNA by heating in the presence of detergents and Chelex-100 resin.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical relevance of detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis. DESIGN: Single-centre prospective case study of 90 hospitalised patients and 50 healthy subjects or blood donors from 1 January to 30 June 1998. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were diagnosed with tuberculosis (26.7%); 20 tuberculosis patients were culture-positive, with seven smear-positive for acid-fast bacilli. Sensitivity of smear, culture and nested PCR was 30.4 (7/23), 87 (20/23) and 30.4% (7/23), respectively. The specificity of smear and culture was 100%, and the specificity of the nested PCR was 96% in the healthy subjects. However, the specificity decreased to 83.6% in the hospitalised patients, with 11 nested PCR-positive patients without a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The sensitivity of the nested PCR was low in pulmonary tuberculosis (22.2%), but increased in pulmonary/extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (50%), extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (33%), and disseminated tuberculosis (33%). CONCLUSION: The use of a nested PCR assay on PBMC may pose problems for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis with regard to low sensitivity and specificity. However, further studies are needed to confirm this technique as an alternative test for the diagnosis of paucibacillary forms of tuberculosis.",0,duplicate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The procedure was established by analysing a subset of 130 clinical samples (70 from patients with tuberculosis and 60 from patients without tuberculosis). The clinical samples included sputum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, blood and serum. The total number of samples positive by PCR before the glass matrix step was 33 and after the glass matrix step was 58, showing that this purification step improved markedly the detection of M. tuberculosis DNA. The detection limit of the amplified DNA in agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide was 10 CFU for serum and cerebrospinal fluid and 50 CFU for sputum. Once established, the procedure was used in the analysis of 179 additional samples from 133 patients suspected of tuberculosis. In general there was an agreement between the results of PCR and clinical diagnosis for tuberculosis. In the case of sputum samples it was possible to compare the PCR and culture results. When considering all the sputum samples analysed, in general the PCR was slightly less sensitive than the culture test. However, when applied to the analysis of samples from patients suspected of tuberculosis, six samples that were culture negative were positive by PCR. Considering the confirmed results of all clinical samples analysed, the sensitivity of the method described in this work (97.4%) was much higher than culture test (45.5%). This difference was mainly due to the low sensitivity of culture test in cerebrospinal fluid, serum and blood samples.

There is a need for rapid diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. We have previously used a PCR to detect circulating Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in blood samples from patients (mostly HIV-infected) with pulmonary tuberculosis. We have now prospectively investigated the role of this blood-based PCR assay for diagnosis of this disease in a clinical setting. Methods. Our PCR assay is specific for the IS6110 insertion element of the M tuberculosis complex of organisms. We from ward pulmonary tuberculosis. Personnel who carried out the assay did not know the results of any clinical investigations and ultimate diagnosis, and clinicians did not know the PCR results. Results of the PCR assay were compared with the final clinical diagnosis. A subgroup of 15 patients had blood samples assayed serially to track the PCR signal over time. Findings. 41 patients had a final clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis, and the cases were typical of those seen at our hospital: HIV infection was common, and most cases were not sputum-smear positive for acid-fast bacilli. The PCR assay correctly identified 39 of 41 patients with proven pulmonary tuberculosis, 26 (63%) of whom were sputum-smear negative. There were five patients in whom a positive PCR result did not accord with the final clinical diagnosis, and two of the 44 negative PCR results were classified as false negatives. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay for a diagnosis of tuberculosis was 95% and 89%, respectively. In 15 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and a positive blood assay, the PCR result remained positive after 1 month of therapy, but had reverted to negative in 13 of the 15 by 4 months of therapy. Interpretation. We conclude that peripheral-blood-based PCR detection for the diagnosis of tuberculosis Is a technically feasible approach that has a potentially important role in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.",0,duplicate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All smear positive samples were PCR positive except for 7/138 (5.07%) that were false negative because of the presence of inhibitors. However, the use of several samples for each patient minimize the false negative results. The PCR allowed the detection of more positive results in smear negative sputa from HIV- (50%) than in HIV+ patients (20.5%). In contrast, in smear negative blood samples, PCR was positive more frequently in HIV+ (30%) than in HIV- patients (12.5%). Regarding patients, 15/25 HIV+ and 13/17 HIV-patients had at least one positive sample with PCR whereas only 7/25 and 11/17 respectively for HIV+ and HIV- patients had smear positive samples.

GeneXpert (Cepheid, CA, USA) is a polyvalent near point-of-care platform and is widely implemented for Xpert MTB/RIF diagnosis. This study sought to evaluate the operational feasibility of integrated HIV VL, EID and MTB/RIF testing in new GeneXpert platforms. METHODS: Whole blood samples were collected from consenting patients due for routine HIV VL testing and DBS samples from infants due for EID testing, at three rural health facilities in Zimbabwe. Sputum samples were collected from all individuals suspected of TB. GeneXpert testing was reserved for all EID, all TB suspects and priority HIV VL at each site. Blood samples were further sent to centralized laboratories for confirmatory testing. GeneXpert polyvalent testing results and patient outcomes, including infrastructural and logistical requirements are reported. The study was conducted over a 10-month period. RESULTS: The fully automated GeneXpert testing device, required minimal training and biosafety considerations. A total of 1,302 HIV VL, 277 EID and 1,581 MTB/RIF samples were tested on a four module GeneXpert platform in each study site. Xpert HIV-1 VL testing was prioritized for patients who presented with advanced HIV disease, pregnant women, adolescents and suspected ART failures patients. On average, the study sites had a GeneXpert utilization rate of 50.4% (Gutu Mission Hospital), 63.5% (Murambinda Mission Hospital) and 17.5% (Chimombe Rural Health Centre) per month. GeneXpert polyvalent testing error rates remained lower than 4% in all sites. Decentralized EID and VL testing on Xpert had shorter overall median TAT (1 day [IQR: 0-4] and 1 day [IQR: 0-1] respectively) compared to centralized testing (17 days [IQR: 13-21] and 26 days [IQR: 23-32] respectively). Among patients with VL >1000 copies/ml (73/640; 11.4%) at GMH health facility, median time to enhanced adherence counselling was 8 days and majority of those with documented outcomes had re-suppressed VL (20/32; 62.5%). Median time to ART initiation among Xpert EID positive infants at GMH was 1 day [IQR: 0-1]. CONCLUSION: Implementation of near point-of-care GeneXpert platform for integrated multi-disease testing within district and sub-district healthcare settings is feasible and will increase access to VL, and EID testing to priority populations. Quality management systems including monitoring of performance indicators, together with regular on-site supervision are crucial, and near-POC test results must be promptly actioned-on by clinicians for patient management.",0,PCR not done on blood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A better understanding of the microbiology of bloodstream infections could improve outcomes. METHODS: We used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based TaqMan Array Card (TAC) to directly test for 43 targets from whole blood. We analyzed 336 cryopreserved specimens from adult Ugandans with sepsis enrolled in a multisite study; 84% were infected with human immunodeficiency virus. We compared qPCR TAC results with blood culture and determined the association of qPCR with study participant outcomes using logistic regression. RESULTS: The most frequently detected targets were cytomegalovirus (CMV, n = 139, 41%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB, n = 70, 21%), Plasmodium (n = 35, 10%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 31, 9%). Diagnostic performance varied by target with qPCR sensitivity averaging 61  28% and specificity 98  3% versus culture. In multivariable analysis, independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included CMV viremia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-5.5; p < .01) and TB qPCR-positivity, whether blood culture-positive (aOR 4.6, 95% CI, 2.1-10.0; p < .01) or blood culture-negative (aOR 2.9, 95% CI, 1.2-6.9; p = .02).

RESULTS: The sensitivities of the IS6110-TaqMan assay calculated for blood, urine, both blood and urine samples, tissue biopsies, extrapulmonary body fluid samples, and all samples from patients calculated together were 55.9%, 33.3%, 68.8%, 43.8%, 29.6%, and 73.7%, respectively, and the specificities were 80%, 100%, 78.6%, 100%, 100%, and 84.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of qPCR was high in various clinical sample types. The analysis of more than one type of clinical sample collected from the same patient with extrapulmonary tuberculosis enhances the diagnostic power of the IS6110-TaqMan assay when compared with the use of only one clinical sample.",1,,cohort,Patients with clinically suspected EPTB,suspected EPTB,Those with final non-TB diagnosis,IS6110 TaqMan,4.5,PBMC isolation,49,34,unclear,NA,adult,0.56,0.8,,,,,,,34,0.56,moderate,Brazil,no,

As no gold standard diagnostic tool is yet available, clinical suspicion and relatively insensitive approaches such as histopathology, laparoscopy and hysterosalpingogram are currently critical determinants in the diagnosis of GTB. Although apolymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay using endometrial tissue seems promising, sampling doesrequire an invasive procedure. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that menstrual blood may provide an alternate non-invasive source of samples for PCR-based GTB diagnosis. METHODS: We enrolled 195 women with primary infertility in whom GTB was suspected. We obtained ethics committee approval from our institution and written informed consent from subjects. Endometrial tissue and menstrual blood was collected from the subjects and culture, histopathology, and multiplex PCR with both sample type was performed for each subject. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of multiplex PCR was, respectively, 90.2 and 86.1% for menstrual blood, 95.8 and 84.3% for endometrial tissue, and 64.8 and 93.2% for histopathology staining. CONCLUSIONS: A strong clinical suspicion aided with multiplex PCR using menstrual blood may significantly reduce the diagnostic dilemma for GTB diagnosis in a non-invasive, sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective manner.",0,PCR not done on peripheral blood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From June 2011 to September 2012 we prospectively enrolled children with symptoms or signs suggestive of tuberculosis at three research centres in Tanzania and Uganda. After clinical assessment, respiratory specimens were collected for microscopy and culture, as well as whole blood for Xpert() MTB/RIF. Children were classified according to standardised case definitions. RESULTS: A total of 232 children were evaluated; 14 (6.0%) had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. The Xpert() MTB/RIF assay detected M. tuberculosis in 5/232 (2.2%) blood samples with 1 (0.4%) error reading and presumably 1 (0.4%) false-positive result. The sensitivity of the assay in children with culture-confirmed (1/14) versus no tuberculosis (1/117) was 7.1% (95% CI, 1.3-31.5). Three of the five Xpert() MTB/RIF positive patients had negative cultures, but were classified as probable tuberculosis cases. Assay sensitivity against a composite reference standard (culture-confirmed, highly probable or probable tuberculosis) was 5.4% (95% CI, 2.1-13.1).

However, blood TB PCR is still not standardised. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the Blacklight Card to standardise TB PCR in blood samples using a multiplex nested PCR method targeting insertion sequence 6110 and MPB64 sequence for use as an auxiliary tool in the diagnosis of TB. DESIGN: The study focused on the standardisation of the Blacklight Card as a new extraction tool and its evaluation using 130 blood samples randomly collected from patients with clinical symptoms of TB. RESULTS: Of 130 cases, PCR was positive in 22 samples (17%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was respectively 95.7% and 100%; the positive and negative predictive values were respectively 85.1% and 99.2%. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the Blacklight Card may be a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of disseminated and extra-pulmonary forms of TB as well as in difficult-to-diagnose cases in which a diagnosis is urgently needed due to the severity of the patient's status.",0,Unclear reference standard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,yes,results are uninterretable

However, the performance of the Xpert assay as applied to other readily accessible body fluids such as exhaled breath condensate (EBC), saliva, urine, and blood has not been established. We used the Xpert assay to test EBC, saliva, urine, and blood samples from HIV-negative, smear- and culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients for the presence of M. tuberculosis. To compare the ability of the assay to perform bacterial load measurements on sputum samples with versus without sample processing, the assay was also performed on paired direct and processed sputum samples from each patient. The Xpert assay detected M. tuberculosis in none of the 26 EBC samples (sensitivity, 0.0%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.0%, 12.9%), 10 of the 26 saliva samples (sensitivity, 38.5%; 95% CI, 22.4%, 57.5%), 1 of 26 urine samples (sensitivity, 3.8%; 95% CI, 0.7%, 18.9%), and 2 of 24 blood samples (sensitivity, 8.3%; 95% CI, 2.3%, 25.8%). For bacterial load measurements in the different types of sputum samples, the cycle thresholds of the two M. tuberculosis-positive sputum types were well correlated (Spearman correlation of 0.834). This study demonstrates that the Xpert assay should not be routinely used to detect M. tuberculosis in EBC, saliva, urine, or blood samples from HIV-negative patients suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis. As a test of bacterial load, the assay produced similar results when used to test direct versus processed sputum samples.

One through 20 ml of blood was spiked with 0.25 to 10 CFU/ml of the M. tuberculosis surrogate M. bovis BCG. Multiple replicates of each sample were processed by a new lysis-centrifugation method and tested with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The assay was very sensitive with increased blood volumes. In the 20-ml samples, BCG was detected in blood spiked with 10, 5, 1, and 0.25 CFU/ml 100, 100, 83, and 57% of the time, respectively, compared to 100, 66, 18, and 18%, of the time, respectively, in 1-ml blood samples. Assay sensitivity was influenced by the type of anticoagulant used, with acid-citrate-dextrose solution B (ACD-B) providing the best results. A limit of detection of 10 CFU/ml was established with BCG spiked into ACD-B-treated blood, and 92, 36, and 33% of the samples with 5, 1, and 0.5 CFU/ml, respectively, were assay positive. The lysis buffer was stable both at room temperature and at 4C for 2 months. The assay was tested with blood stored for 8 days without a change in sensitivity as measured by cycle threshold. This new assay format extends the capability of the Xpert MTB/RIF test, enabling up to 20 ml of blood to be tested rapidly for the presence of M. tuberculosis. This approach may be a useful method to detect extrapulmonary tuberculosis and the risk of death in immunocompromised patients.",0,spiked sample study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Biological samples were obtained from children (<15 years old) with clinical suspicion of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB at public hospitals in Recife-Pernambuco, Brazil. Cultures yielded negative results in a majority of childhood TB cases, which are generally paucibacillary. A set of clinical, epidemiological, radiological, and laboratory criteria with evident clinical improvement after anti-TB treatment were frequently used to define childhood TB cases. RESULTS: Ninety children with clinical suspicion were enrolled in this study (44 with TB and 46 without TB).

However, there are still no efficient diagnostic tests that combine high sensitivity and specificity and yield rapid results in the detection of TB. This study evaluated single-tube nested polymerase chain reaction (STNPCR) as a molecular diagnostic test with low risk of cross contamination for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical samples. METHODS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected in blood and urine samples by STNPCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In this system, reaction tubes were not opened between the two stages of PCR (simple and nested). RESULTS: STNPCR demonstrated good accuracy in clinical samples with no cross contamination between microtubes. Sensitivity in blood and urine, analyzed in parallel, was 35%-62% for pulmonary and 41%-72% for extrapulmonary TB.

However, there are still no efficient diagnostic tests that combine high sensitivity and specificity and yield rapid results in the detection of TB. This study evaluated single-tube nested polymerase chain reaction (STNPCR) as a molecular diagnostic test with low risk of cross contamination for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical samples. METHODS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected in blood and urine samples by STNPCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In this system, reaction tubes were not opened between the two stages of PCR (simple and nested). RESULTS: STNPCR demonstrated good accuracy in clinical samples with no cross contamination between microtubes. Sensitivity in blood and urine, analyzed in parallel, was 35%-62% for pulmonary and 41%-72% for extrapulmonary TB. The specificity of STNPCR was 100% in most analyses, depending on the type of clinical sample (blood or urine) and clinical form of disease (pulmonary or extrapulmonary). CONCLUSIONS: STNPCR was effective in detecting TB, especially the extrapulmonary form for which sensitivity was higher, and had the advantage of less invasive sample collection from patients for whom a spontaneous sputum sample was unavailable.

We prospectively evaluated the usefulness of PCR performed in blood and urine samples from patients with proved or probable TB compared with a control group of patients. The PCR technique was performed using IS6110 primers. We included in the study 57 patients (43 with definite TB and 14 with probable TB) and 26 controls. Blood and urine samples were drawn at the time of microbiologic diagnosis and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months later. Cultures were positive in the early period (<1 month after treatment) in 11 of 57 patients (19%) with probable or definite TB, in comparison with 42% of patients (24/57) who yielded a positive PCR (P = 0.02). Urine samples increased the sensitivity of PCR determination in blood samples by 10%. The PCR in blood and/or urine was positive in 41% of patients with pulmonary TB, in 36% of patients with extrapulmonary TB, and in 50% of patients with disseminated TB. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was still detectable by PCR in 5 of 13 patients with cured TB after 1 or more months of antituberculous treatment. The PCR detection of M. tuberculosis in blood and urine samples is useful for the diagnosis of different clinical forms of TB, mostly in those patients in which sample extraction is difficult or requires aggressive techniques. The sensitivity of this technique could be improved studying more than 1 sample in each patient, even after initiating an antituberculous treatment.",1,,case-control,Patients admitted to hospital with tuberculosis confirmed by culture or probable TB on clinical diagnosis,diagnosed PTB or EPTB,healthy volunteers,IS6110 pcr,5,PBMC isolation,70,57,inpatient,0.44,adult,0.32,1,25,25,0.32,NA,,,14,0.29,high,Spain,yes,

METHODS: Web-based survey of Paediatric-Tuberculosis-Network-European-Trialsgroup (ptbnet) and Tuberculosis-Network-European-Trialsgroup (TBnet) members conducted June to December 2013. Both networks comprise clinicians, microbiologists, epidemiologists and researchers predominately based in Europe. RESULTS: 191 healthcare professionals from 31 European countries participated. Overall, 26.8% of respondents did not have access to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay; only 44.6% had access to the assay in-house. However, a substantial proportion had access to other commercial and/or non-commercial PCR-based assays for TB (68.8% and 31.8%, respectively). Only 6.4% did not have access to any PCR-based assays for TB. A large proportion of participants with access to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay had used it for the analysis of non-respiratory samples [pleural fluid: 36.5%, gastric aspirates: 34.7%, cerebrospinal fluid: 34.7%, stool samples: 4.3%, blood/serum: 2.6%, 'other samples' (which included biopsy/tissue samples, lymph node aspirates, joint aspirates and urine samples): 16.5%]. Regarding interferon-gamma release assays, a greater proportion of respondents had access to the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay (84.7%) than to the T-SPOT.TB assay (52.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Both immunological and molecular TB tests are widely available across Europe. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay is more widely used than the T-SPOT.TB assay, which may reflect the difficulties of integrating an ELISPOT assay into the routine laboratory setting. Although Xpert MTB/RIF assays are optimised and solely licensed for the analysis of sputum samples, in clinical practice they are commonly used for non-respiratory samples. Further research is needed to establish how current molecular TB tests impact on patient care and outcome in the routine clinical setting.",0,survey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the Gene-Xpert platform, a rapid, PCR-based diagnostic platform, has been validated for the diagnosis of TB with sputum. We have evaluated the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteremia and investigated its impact on clinical outcomes. Consecutive HIV-infected adults with fever and cough presenting to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, were recruited and followed up for 2 months. At presentation, three sputum samples were examined by smear, culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the presence of M. tuberculosis and blood was drawn for PCR with Xpert, for mycobacterial culture (Myco/F Lytic), and for aerobic culture. One hundred four patients were recruited, and 44 (43%) were sputum culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Ten were Xpert blood positive, for a sensitivity of 21% and a specificity of 100%. The 2-week mortality rate was significantly higher among patients who were Xpert blood positive than among those who were negative (40% versus 3%; multivariate odds ratio [OR] for death if positive, 44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3 to 662). This effect persisted on assessment of the mortality rate at 2 months (40% versus 11%; OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 24.6). When screening uncomplicated patients presenting with a productive cough for pulmonary TB, Xpert blood offers no diagnostic advantage over sputum testing. Despite this, Xpert blood positivity is highly predictive of early death and this test rapidly identifies a group of patients in urgent need of initiation of treatment.",1,,cohort,HIV positive patients with fever and cough,PUO,Patients with a final diagnosis not TB,Xpert MTB/Rif,20,RBC lysis and concentration without wash,104,44,inpatient,1,adult,0.21,1,104,44,0.21,1,,,,,low,Malawi,yes,

As such, new tools for laboratory diagnosis are urgently needed to improve the case detection rate, especially in regions with a high prevalence of TB and HIV. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of two in house PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): PCR dot-blot methodology (PCR dot-blot) and PCR agarose gel electrophoresis (PCR-AG) for the diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) in HIV seropositive and HIV seronegative patients. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted (from May 2003 to May 2004) in a TB/HIV reference hospital. Sputum specimens from 277 PTB suspects were tested by Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear, Culture and in house PCR assays (PCR dot-blot and PCR-AG) and their performances evaluated. Positive cultures combined with the definition of clinical pulmonary TB were employed as the gold standard. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of PTB was 46% (128/277); in HIV+, prevalence was 54.0% (40/74). The sensitivity and specificity of PCR dot-blot were 74% (CI 95%; 66.1%-81.2%) and 85% (CI 95%; 78.8%-90.3%); and of PCR-AG were 43% (CI 95%; 34.5%-51.6%) and 76% (CI 95%; 69.2%-82.8%), respectively. For HIV seropositive and HIV seronegative samples, sensitivities of PCR dot-blot (72% vs 75%; p=0.46) and PCR-AG (42% vs 43%; p=0.54) were similar. Among HIV seronegative patients and PTB suspects, ROC analysis presented the following values for the AFB smear (0.837), Culture (0.926), PCR dot-blot (0.801) and PCR-AG (0.599). In HIV seropositive patients, these area values were (0.713), (0.900), (0.789) and (0.595), respectively. CONCLUSION: Results of this study demonstrate that the in house PCR dot blot may be an improvement for ruling out PTB diagnosis in PTB suspects assisted at hospitals with a high prevalence of TB/HIV.",0,PCR not done on peripheral blood,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 32 of these patients, the diagnosis of tuberculosis was eventually confirmed by conventional bacteriological or histological procedures. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected with the PCR technique in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 9 of 11 (82%) HIV-infected patients and in 7 of 21 (33%) HIV-negative patients (P < 0.01), while M. tuberculosis blood cultures were positive in 1 of 8 (12.5%) and 1 of 18 (5.5%) patients, respectively. PCR was positive in all cases with disseminated disease in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients and also in the HIV-positive patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Seven samples from patients with documented illness other than tuberculosis and 12 specimens from healthy volunteers, including seven volunteers with a recent positive purified protein derivative test, were used as controls and had a negative PCR. These results suggest that detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may be a useful tool for rapid diagnosis of disseminated and extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis, especially in an HIV-positive population.",0,duplicate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only three of 12 patients with a positive blood culture had a PCR result positive for M. avium in peripheral blood.

The performance of the genus probe was compared with the performance of probes specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium and with that of standard culture. In addition, the utility of an internal control in monitoring amplification inhibitors was studied. Of 545 respiratory and 325 nonrespiratory specimens (a total of 870 specimens), 58 (6.7%) showed the presence of amplification inhibitors, as determined by a negative result for the internal control. Of these 58 specimens, 31 (53%) were stool specimens; other material, even citrate blood after lysis of erythrocytes, did not pose a problem with regard to inhibition of PCR amplification. Eighty-one of the remaining 812 specimens had a positive Mycobacterium culture result. Of these culture-positive specimens, 58 (71.6%) showed a positive result with the Mycobacterium genus-specific probe. Seventy-two samples had a positive result with the Mycobacterium-specific probe but a negative culture result. Of these 72 samples, 26 samples were regarded as true positive, either because the M. tuberculosis- or M. avium-specific probe was also positive at the same time or because other specimens from the same patient taken at the same time were culture positive. The sensitivity of the Mycobacterium-specific probe was 78.5% and the specificity was 93.5%. This study showed that pretesting of clinical specimens for mycobacteria to the genus level with a Mycobacterium-specific probe offers the routine clinical laboratory the possibility of detecting tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria with one test. Furthermore, specimens testing positive with the genus-specific probe can be immediately identified with species-specific probes.",0,duplicate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood and urine samples from healthy donors spiked with cfDNA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and samples from tuberculosis patients were used to evaluate the impact of blood collection tube, urine preservative, processing delay, processing method, freezing and thawing, and sample volume on pcfDNA. The PCR cycle threshold (C(T) ) was used to measure amplifiable cfDNA. In spiked samples, the median C(T) values for M. tuberculosis, S. enterica, and EBV cfDNA were significantly lower in blood collected in K(2)EDTA tubes than those in Streck and PAXgene blood collection tubes, and they were was significantly lower in urine preserved with EDTA (EDTA-urine) than in urine preserved with Streck reagent (Streck-urine). Blood and urine samples from TB patients preserved with K(2)EDTA and Tris-EDTA, respectively, showed significantly lower median M. tuberculosis C(T) values than with the Streck blood collection tube and Streck urine preservative. Processing delay increased the median pathogen C(T) values for Streck and PAXgene but not K(2)EDTA blood samples and for urine preserved with Streck reagent but not EDTA. Double-spin compared with single-spin plasma separation increased the median pathogen C(T) regardless of blood collection tube. No differences were observed between whole urine and supernatant and between fresh and thawed plasma and urine after 24weeks at -80C. Larger plasma and urine volumes in contrived and patient samples showed a significantly lower median M. tuberculosis C(T) These findings suggest that large-volume single-spin K(2)EDTA-plasma and EDTA-whole urine with up to a 24-h processing delay may optimize pcfDNA detection.",0,True and false positive and negative results not reported,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These infections pose a major risk to travelers to these regions as well. Methods: We developed and evaluated a multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the simultaneous detection of the three pathogens in 305 patients' buffy coat samples. Results: The assay for S. typhi and B. pseudomallei was able to detect down to 1 colony forming unit/5 L PCR input and M. tuberculosis was detected down to 20 genome copies/5 L PCR input. S. typhi was detected in 10 (3.3 %) individuals, B. pseudomallei in 10 individuals (3.3 %), and M. tuberculosis in 18 individuals (5.9 %). Co-infections of M. tuberculosis and B. pseudomallei were detected in three individuals and S. typhi and B. pseudomallei in two individuals.

With the aim of evaluating the usefulness of a nested-PCR method on samples of blood and urine of patients suspected of tuberculosis we analyzed 192 clinical samples, using as a molecular target the insertion element IS6110 specific of M. tuberculosis genome. Nested-PCR method showed higher sensitivity in patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis (47.8% and 52% in blood and urine) when compared to patients with the pulmonary form of the disease (sensitivity of 29% and 26.9% in blood and urine), regardless of the type of biological sample used. The nested-PCR is a rapid technique that, even if not showing a good sensitivity, should be considered as a helpful tool especially in the extrapulmonary cases or in cases where confirmatory diagnosis is quite difficult to be achieved by routine methods. The performance of PCR-based techniques should be considered and tested in future works on other types of biological specimens besides sputum, like blood and urine, readily obtainable in most cases. The improving of M. tuberculosis nested-PCR detection in TB affected patients will give the possibility of an earlier detection of bacilli thus interrupting the transmission chain of the disease.",0,duplicate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have improved our previously reported PCR based on the amplification of a fragment of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex- specific insertion element IS6110 with respect to both problems. False- positive reactions caused by amplicon contamination were prevented by the use of uracil-N-glycosylase and dUTP instead of dTTP. We selected a new set of primers outside the region spanned by the formerly used primers to avoid false-positive reactions caused by dTTP-containing amplicons still present in the laboratory. With this new primer set, 16 copies of the IS6110 insertion element, the equivalent of two bacteria, could be amplified 1010 times in 40 cycles, resulting in a mean efficiency of 77% per cycle. To detect the presence of inhibitors of the Taq polymerase, which may cause false-negative reactions, part of each sample was spiked with M. tuberculosis DNA. The DNA purification method using guanidinium thiocyanate and diatoms effectively removed most or all inhibitors of the PCR. However, this was not suitable for blood samples, for which we developed a proteinase K treatment followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. This method permitted detection of 20 M. tuberculosis bacteria per ml of whole blood. Various laboratory procedures were introduced to reduce failure or inhibition of PCR and avoid DNA cross contamination. We have tested 218 different clinical specimens obtained from patients suspected of having tuberculosis. The samples included sputum (n = 145), tissue biopsy samples (n = 25), cerebrospinal fluid (n = 15), blood (n = 14), pleural fluid (n = 9), feces (n = 7), fluid from fistulae (n = 2), and pus from a wound (n = 1). The results obtained by PCR were consistent with those obtained with culture, which is the 'gold standard.'
