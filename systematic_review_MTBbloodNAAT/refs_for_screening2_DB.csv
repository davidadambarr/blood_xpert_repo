This study examined the role of apoptosis in immunity to tuberculosis. METHODS: Cell subsets from tuberculosis cases and tuberculin skin test-positive (TST(+)) and TST-negative (TST(-)) household contacts (HHCs) were analyzed for expression of annexin-V and propidium iodide by flow cytometry. RNA microarrays were used to determine differences in apoptotic gene expression levels and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was used to analyze gene expression in HHCs who progressed to active tuberculosis. RESULTS: T cells from TST(+)HHC exhibited higher levels of apoptosis than tuberculosis cases; however, tuberculosis cases had a higher proportion of late apoptotic cells within the CD3(+)PD-1(+) subset. Tuberculosis cases had reduced levels of antiapoptotic genes compared to HHCs with a significant reduction in BCL2 associated with disease progression at least 1 year prior to progression. CONCLUSIONS: While T cells are clearly able to mount a robust immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, there are increased levels of apoptosis seen in effector T cells from tuberculosis patients. Dysregulation of several apoptotic genes suggest that apoptosis is a major functional pathway that could be targeted for future host-directed therapeutics."

Although it is established that HIV reduces Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific T cell responses, the causes of this dysfunction are not known. We used the cynomolgus macaque model of TB to demonstrate that ex vivo SIV reduces the frequency of M. tuberculosis-specific TNF and IFN--producing T cells within 24 h after infection. In vivo, T cell IFN- responses in granulomas from animals with SIV/M. tuberculosis coinfection were lower than SIV-negative animals with active TB. The SIV effects on the inhibition of T cell responses were primarily on APCs and not the T cells directly. Specifically, reductions in the frequency of TNF-producing M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cells were caused, at least in part, by SIV-induced production of monocyte derived IL-5."

Previous studies in cattle have demonstrated that the protection induced by BCG is not complete. In order to improve the protection efficacy of BCG, in this study we overexpressed Ag85B in a BCG Pasteur strain, by using an expression system based on the use of an auxotrophic strain for the leucine amino acid, and complementation with leuD. We found that vaccination of cattle with BCG overexpressing Ag85B induced higher production of IL-17 and IL-4 mRNA upon purified protein derivative (PPDB) stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than vaccination with BCG. Moreover, the IL-17 mRNA expression after vaccination negatively correlated with disease severity resulting from a subsequent challenge with M. bovis, suggesting that this cytokine is a potential biomarker of cattle protection against bovine tuberculosis. Importantly, vaccination with the recombinant BCG vaccine protected cattle better than the wild-type BCG Pasteur."

The tuberculin skin test and peripheral blood interferon- release assays do not distinguish active TB from a cleared or latent infection. Microbiological culture of mycobacteria is slow. Moreover, the sensitivities of culture and microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and nucleic acid detection by PCR are often compromised by difficulty in obtaining samples from the site of disease. Consequently, we need sensitive and rapid tests for easily obtained clinical samples, which can be deployed to assess patients exposed to TB, discriminate TB from other infectious, inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, and to identify subclinical TB in HIV-1 infected patients prior to commencing antiretroviral therapy. We discuss the evaluation of peripheral blood transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to develop the next generation of rapid diagnostics for active TB. We catalogue the studies published to date seeking to discriminate active TB from healthy volunteers, patients with latent infection and those with other diseases. We identify the limitations of these studies and the barriers to their adoption in clinical practice. In so doing, we aim to develop a framework to guide our approach to discovery and development of diagnostic biomarkers for active TB."

Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) in plasma is a diagnostic target in new obstetric and oncologic applications, but its utility for diagnosing TB is not known. Here we show that Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA can be detected in plasma of persons with sputum smear-positive TB, even in the absence of mycobacteremia. Among 40 participants with bacteriologically-confirmed smear-positive TB disease who had plasma tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR), 18/40 (45%) had a positive result on at least one triplicate reaction. Our results suggest that plasma DNA may be a useful target for improving clinicians' ability to diagnose TB. We anticipate these findings to be the starting point for optimized methods of TB ccfDNA testing and sequence-based diagnostic applications such as molecular detection of drug resistance."

METHODS: One hundred two patients with suspected bone and joint tuberculosis (BJTB) were admitted to Zhengzhou Orthopaedics Hospital, Henan, China from April 2018 to February 2019. The Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT.TB tests were performed using pus specimens and peripheral blood, respectively. The diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT.TB tests was evaluated on the basis of the composite reference standard (CRS). RESULT: A Total of 73 suspected BJTB were enrolled and categorized, including 12 confirmed BJTB, 27 probable BJTB and 34 non-BJTB. When CRS was used as the reference, the specificity, PPV and NLR values of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay were significantly higher than those of the T-SPOT.TB assay (97.1% vs. 82.4%, p<0.05; 96.7% vs. 85.4%, p<0.05; 0.26 vs. 0.12, p<0.05). However, the sensitivity, NPV and PLR values of the T-SPOT. TB assay were significantly higher than those of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (89.7% vs. 74.4%, p<0.05; 87.5% vs. 76.7%, p<0.05; 5.08 vs. 2.52, p<0.05). The AUCs from Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT. TB tests were 0.857 and 0.860, respectively. However, the difference was not statistically significant. The Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT. TB tests demonstrated medium concordance in diagnosing BJTB. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB test combined with the specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF not only shorten the time of diagnosis but also improve the accuracy of diagnosis of BJTB and reduce the misdiagnosis rate. Therefore, they are useful for early diagnosis of BJTB."

In the past 2-3 decades, many new tests were introduced for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and some of them have been evaluated for their application in pediatric tuberculosis as well. There is an attempt to improve smear microscopy by introducing light-emitting diode (LED) fluorescence microscopy and there are also some automated digital microscopy platforms under evaluation. Introduction of automated liquid culture platform along with rapid molecular based identification methods have considerably reduced the time delay in mycobacterial culture. Recent addition of many nucleic acid amplification platforms like Amplicor PCR, Genprobe, Xpert MTB/Rif, line probe assays, loop mediated isothermal amplification etc are also been found to be useful. Latest techniques like microarray and gene sequencing are also being used in clinical laboratories with variable results. Indirect methods of TB diagnosis like T cell based assays including tuberculin skin test and interferon-gamma release assays have their role primarily in the diagnosis of latent TB. Biomarkers are the latest addition in the battery of TB diagnostic tests facilitating diagnosis using easily accessible samples like urine, blood and breath of patients. Many biomarkers are still under evaluation and some of them are found to have a potential role as promising diagnostic tests of future."

GeneXpert (Cepheid, CA, USA) is a polyvalent near point-of-care platform and is widely implemented for Xpert MTB/RIF diagnosis. This study sought to evaluate the operational feasibility of integrated HIV VL, EID and MTB/RIF testing in new GeneXpert platforms. METHODS: Whole blood samples were collected from consenting patients due for routine HIV VL testing and DBS samples from infants due for EID testing, at three rural health facilities in Zimbabwe. Sputum samples were collected from all individuals suspected of TB. GeneXpert testing was reserved for all EID, all TB suspects and priority HIV VL at each site. Blood samples were further sent to centralized laboratories for confirmatory testing. GeneXpert polyvalent testing results and patient outcomes, including infrastructural and logistical requirements are reported. The study was conducted over a 10-month period. RESULTS: The fully automated GeneXpert testing device, required minimal training and biosafety considerations. A total of 1,302 HIV VL, 277 EID and 1,581 MTB/RIF samples were tested on a four module GeneXpert platform in each study site. Xpert HIV-1 VL testing was prioritized for patients who presented with advanced HIV disease, pregnant women, adolescents and suspected ART failures patients. On average, the study sites had a GeneXpert utilization rate of 50.4% (Gutu Mission Hospital), 63.5% (Murambinda Mission Hospital) and 17.5% (Chimombe Rural Health Centre) per month. GeneXpert polyvalent testing error rates remained lower than 4% in all sites. Decentralized EID and VL testing on Xpert had shorter overall median TAT (1 day [IQR: 0-4] and 1 day [IQR: 0-1] respectively) compared to centralized testing (17 days [IQR: 13-21] and 26 days [IQR: 23-32] respectively). Among patients with VL >1000 copies/ml (73/640; 11.4%) at GMH health facility, median time to enhanced adherence counselling was 8 days and majority of those with documented outcomes had re-suppressed VL (20/32; 62.5%). Median time to ART initiation among Xpert EID positive infants at GMH was 1 day [IQR: 0-1]. CONCLUSION: Implementation of near point-of-care GeneXpert platform for integrated multi-disease testing within district and sub-district healthcare settings is feasible and will increase access to VL, and EID testing to priority populations. Quality management systems including monitoring of performance indicators, together with regular on-site supervision are crucial, and near-POC test results must be promptly actioned-on by clinicians for patient management."

A total of 2600 cross-breed dairy cattle in Menoufia and Daqahlia governorates were tested by the single intradermal tuberculin test where the disease prevalence was 1.8%. Serum and whole blood samples were collected from positive tuberculin reactors for ELISA and IFN- assay, respectively. After slaughtering of positive tuberculin reactors, the post-mortem examination was carried out and tissue samples were collected for the bacteriological examination and PCR. The percentage of visible lesions of tuberculin reactors was 78.7%, while non-visible lesions were 21.27%. Culture technique revealed that the percentage of bTB was 63.8%. The ELISA and IFN- assay using short-term culture filtrate (ST-CF) prepared antigen revealed higher sensitivity (72.3% and 82.9%) than the bovine purified protein derivative (PPD-B) antigen. Although prepared ST-CF antigen has great efficiency and eligibility for the diagnosis of bTB, PCR appeared to have a higher sensitivity (85.1%) than other diagnostic methods when dealing with post-mortem samples. Gamma interferon assay using ST-CF antigen is recommended for antemortem diagnosis of bTB in cattle."

The detection platform could be applied on a microfluidics chip with a mobile system controller to eliminate contamination and to facilitate potential use in remote areas. As a proof of concept, two fluorescence-labeled ssDNA tags were used for detection of miR-29a and miR-144*, two miRNAs that are highly expressed in the blood circulation of some patients with cancer or tuberculosis. The circular ssDNA probes in this study were designed to have an advantage over padlock probes as they can be prepared in advance. Our multiplex miRNA detection platform exhibited high sensitivity and selectivity, with a limit of detection of 0.05pmol. In addition, our platform could detect target miRNAs from the total miRNA population extracted from human serum or a cancer cell line. These results indicated that our miRNA sensor has the potential to provide simple and high throughput miRNA analysis for disease diagnosis and prognosis."

After comprehensive analysis, we selected 15 putative differentially expressed serum proteins and 15 plasma proteins for validation by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) with the same cohort used in the iTRAQ analysis. Four serum and five PPD-B-stimulated proteins were confirmed in follow-up enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. PPD-B-stimulated interleukin 8 (IL-8) displayed the potential to differentiate M. bovis-infected cattle from NC, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9662, while PPD-B-stimulated C-reactive protein (CRP) displayed the potential to differentiate bTB(PCR-P) from bTB(PCR-N), with an AUC value of 1.00. Finally, double-blind testing with 244 cattle indicated that the PPD-B-stimulated IL-8 test exhibited good agreement with traditional tests ( > 0.877) with a >90% relative sensitivity and a >98% relative specificity; the PPD-B-stimulated CRP test displayed good agreement with nested PCR ( = 0.9117), with an observed 94% relative sensitivity and 97% relative specificity.

Although plasma IL-37 is elevated in patients with tuberculosis (TB), IL-37 source and immune correlate in TB have not been investigated. It is also unknown whether and how TB can influence the ability of immune cells to mount innate responses of IL-37 and pre-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we demonstrated that IL-37b-producing monocytes coincided with a source of elevated plasma IL-37b in TB patients. While IL-37b production in TB was associated with prolonged/complicated TB, TB burdens and inflammatory reactions, it negatively correlated with immune responses of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and TNF- or IL-10. Interestingly, mycobacterial re-infection of monocytes from TB patients, but not healthy BCG-vaccinated controls, enhanced or sustained IL-37b production by cultured monocytes. TB-sensitized monocytes from TB patients mounted more robust immune responses of IL-37b than those of pre-inflammatory cytokines during mycobacterial re-infection in culture. Our data represent new findings in terms of IL-37b responses, immune correlates and potential mechanisms in TB patients."

A better understanding of the microbiology of bloodstream infections could improve outcomes. METHODS: We used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based TaqMan Array Card (TAC) to directly test for 43 targets from whole blood. We analyzed 336 cryopreserved specimens from adult Ugandans with sepsis enrolled in a multisite study; 84% were infected with human immunodeficiency virus. We compared qPCR TAC results with blood culture and determined the association of qPCR with study participant outcomes using logistic regression. RESULTS: The most frequently detected targets were cytomegalovirus (CMV, n = 139, 41%), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB, n = 70, 21%), Plasmodium (n = 35, 10%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 31, 9%). Diagnostic performance varied by target with qPCR sensitivity averaging 61  28% and specificity 98  3% versus culture. In multivariable analysis, independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality included CMV viremia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-5.5; p < .01) and TB qPCR-positivity, whether blood culture-positive (aOR 4.6, 95% CI, 2.1-10.0; p < .01) or blood culture-negative (aOR 2.9, 95% CI, 1.2-6.9; p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Using qPCR TAC on direct blood specimens, CMV and TB were the most commonly identified targets and were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality. qPCR TAC screening of blood for multiple targets may be useful to guide triage and treatment of sepsis in sub-Saharan Africa."

These conditions exhibit similar symptoms, physical signs, and imaging features. Rapidly and accurately diagnosing OA-TB in patients with inflammatory arthritis presents a challenge to clinicians. Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a rapid diagnostic tool for diagnosis of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. This study was designed to investigate diagnostic efficiency of Xpert for OA-TB in patients with inflammatory arthritis in China. METHODS: A total of 83 consecutive patients with inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB were enrolled prospectively from June 2014 to May 2018. Demographic, clinical, and biological data were recorded. Xpert assay, smear microscopy examination (smear), BACTEC MGIT 960 (MGIT 960), pathological examination, and T-SPOT.TB test were performed for each patient who received operations. Diagnostic efficiency of Xpert was evaluated based on a composite reference standard (CRS). RESULTS: A total of 49 out of 83 patients with inflammatory arthritis and suspected OA-TB received operations, and 49 specimens were obtained during operations. According to CRS, 36 out of 49 patients with inflammatory arthritis were diagnosed with OA-TB, and 13 were not affected by the condition. Sensitivity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 960, pathological examination, and T-SPOT.TB test reached 66.70% (24/36), 25.00% (9/36), 30.55% (11/36), 47.22% (17/36), and 80.55% (29/36), respectively. Specificity of Xpert assay, smear, MGIT 960, and pathological examination was all 100% (13/13). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB test was 53.84% (7/13). Sensitivity of Xpert was higher than that of smear, MGIT 960 and pathological examination, but the sensitivity of Xpert was lower than that of T-SPOT.TB. Sensitivity of Xpert was statistically different from that of smear and MGIT 960 (P<0.001, P = 0.002), but the sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (P = 0.096, P = 0.181). Specificity of T-SPOT.TB was less than that of Xpert, smear, MGIT 960, and pathological examination, and the difference between them was statistically significant (P = 0.015). Among the 27 OA-TB patients with smear negative results, Xpert had the highest sensitivity, but sensitivity of Xpert was not significantly different from that of pathological examination and T-SPOT.TB (P = 0.413, P = 0.783). 2 of 36 OA-TB patients exhibited RIF resistance. Xpert was concordant with MGIT 960-based drug susceptibility testing (DST) in detecting rifampin (RIF) resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Xpert is an efficient tool with high sensitivity and specificity for OA-TB diagnosis in patients with inflammatory arthritis in high-TB prevalence countries. Compared with conventional methods, Xpert has two advantages: one is fast, and the other is able to provide RIF resistance information simultaneously."

METHODS: 143 biological samples and tissues from patients with suspected extrapulmonary tuberculosis from the health services of Recife/Pernambuco/Brazil were evaluated with the IS6110-TaqMan assay. RESULTS: The sensitivities of the IS6110-TaqMan assay calculated for blood, urine, both blood and urine samples, tissue biopsies, extrapulmonary body fluid samples, and all samples from patients calculated together were 55.9%, 33.3%, 68.8%, 43.8%, 29.6%, and 73.7%, respectively, and the specificities were 80%, 100%, 78.6%, 100%, 100%, and 84.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of qPCR was high in various clinical sample types. The analysis of more than one type of clinical sample collected from the same patient with extrapulmonary tuberculosis enhances the diagnostic power of the IS6110-TaqMan assay when compared with the use of only one clinical sample."

The study analyzed the different modes of diagnosis available in a developing country set up over a period of five years to understand the diagnostic values of the current conventional and automated methods of diagnosis of TBM among the patients suspected with chronic meningitis. METHODS: A total of 10,281 cerebrospinal fluid samples (CSF) were collected from suspected chronic meningitis patients, of which 790 samples were from individuals who had clinically suspected TBM. The samples were subjected to CSF cytology and staining, culturing, immunological tests, molecular techniques, and methods for detection of drug resistance. RESULTS: The TBM patients were predominantly male, with a mean age of 21-40 years. CSF pleocytosis and lymphocytic predominance were noted. Culture had 40.13% positivity among clinically suspected TBM patients. The multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis (MDR-TB) constituted 3.14% of the total clinical isolates. With IS6110 PCR, a specificity of 92.86% and sensitivity of 100% are seen with an assay threshold of 30pg/ml. Line probe assay (LPA) using culture isolates had a sensitivity of 97.67% and a specificity of 100%. Direct CSF LPA showed a sensitivity of 96.15% and a specificity of 100%.

We evaluated the performance of the current ICF algorithm [symptom screening, followed by Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) testing] in 2 HIV subgroups and evaluated whether ICF performance could be improved if TB screening was based on C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. METHODS: We enrolled consecutive adults with CD4 counts 350 cells/L initiating antiretroviral therapy and performed symptom screening, CRP testing using a low-cost point-of-care (POC) assay, and collected sputum for Xpert testing. We compared the yield and efficiency of the current ICF algorithm to POC CRP-based ICF among patients new to HIV care and patients engaged in care. RESULTS: Of 1794 patients, 126/1315 (10%) new patients and 21/479 (4%) engaged patients had Xpert-positive TB. The current ICF algorithm detected 98% of all TB cases in both subgroups but required 85% of all patients to undergo Xpert testing. POC CRP-based ICF halved the proportion of patients in both subgroups requiring Xpert testing relative to the current ICF algorithm and had lower yield among patients engaged in care [81% vs. 100%, difference -19% (95% confidence interval: -41 to 3)]. Among patients new to care, POC CRP-based ICF had similar yield as the current ICF algorithm [93% vs. 98%, difference -6% (95% confidence interval: -11 to 0)]. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients new to care, POC CRP-based screening can improve ICF efficiency without compromising ICF yield, whereas symptom-based screening may be necessary to maximize ICF yield among patients engaged in care."

Due to the non-specific clinical presentation and lack of efficient diagnosis methods, it is difficult to discriminate TBM from other frequent types of meningitis, especially viral meningitis (VM). In order to identify the potential biomarkers for discriminating TBM and VM and to reveal the different pathophysiological processes between TBM and VM, a genome-wide miRNA screening of PBMCs from TBM, VM, and healthy controls (HCs) using microarray assay was performed (12 samples). Twenty-eight differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between TBM and VM, and 11 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between TBM and HCs. The 6 overlapping miRNAs detected in both TBM vs. VM and TBM vs. HCs were verified by qPCR analysis and showed a 100% consistent expression patterns with that in microarray test. Statistically significant differences of 4 miRNAs (miR-126-3p, miR-130a-3p, miR-151a-3p, and miR-199a-5p) were further confirmed in TBM compared with VM and HCs in independent PBMCs sample set (n = 96, P < 0.01). Three of which were also showed significantly different between TBM and VM in CSF samples (n = 70, P < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of these 4 miRNAs in PBMCs were more than 0.70 in discriminating TBM from VM. Combination of these 4 miRNAs could achieve better discriminative capacity [AUC = 0.893 (0.788-0.957)], with a sensitivity of 90.6% (75.0-98.0%), and a specificity of 86.7% (69.3-96.2%). Additional validation was performed to evaluate the diagnostic panel in another independent sample set (n = 49), which yielded a sensitivity of 81.8% (9/11), and specificity of 90.0% (9/10) in distinguishing TBM and VM, and a sensitivity of 81.8% (9/11), and a specificity of 84.6% (11/13) in discriminating TBM from other non-TBM patients. This study uncovered the miRNA profiles of TBM and VM patients, which can facilitate better understanding of the pathogenesis involved in these two diseases and identified 4 novel miRNAs in distinguishing TBM and VM."

As no gold standard diagnostic tool is yet available, clinical suspicion and relatively insensitive approaches such as histopathology, laparoscopy and hysterosalpingogram are currently critical determinants in the diagnosis of GTB. Although apolymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay using endometrial tissue seems promising, sampling doesrequire an invasive procedure. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that menstrual blood may provide an alternate non-invasive source of samples for PCR-based GTB diagnosis. METHODS: We enrolled 195 women with primary infertility in whom GTB was suspected. We obtained ethics committee approval from our institution and written informed consent from subjects. Endometrial tissue and menstrual blood was collected from the subjects and culture, histopathology, and multiplex PCR with both sample type was performed for each subject. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of multiplex PCR was, respectively, 90.2 and 86.1% for menstrual blood, 95.8 and 84.3% for endometrial tissue, and 64.8 and 93.2% for histopathology staining. CONCLUSIONS: A strong clinical suspicion aided with multiplex PCR using menstrual blood may significantly reduce the diagnostic dilemma for GTB diagnosis in a non-invasive, sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective manner."

This study compares the sensitivities and specificities of three molecular tests, namely, the Xpert MTB/RIF test, the Xpert Ultra (Ultra), and RealTime MTB (RT-MTB), in a high HIV prevalence setting. Symptomatic adults were recruited from three outpatient sites, and each provided 4 sputum specimens. The diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF, Ultra, and RT-MTB was evaluated, with culture as a reference standard. HIV infection occurred in 62% of patients, with a median CD4 count of 220 cells/l. The Ultra test had the highest sensitivity of 89.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78.1 to 96) compared to those of the Xpert MTB/RIF at 82.1% (95% CI, 69.6 to 91.1; P=0.12) and RT-MTB at 78.6% (95% CI, 65.6 to 88.4; P=0.68). The specificity was highest with the Xpert MTB/RIF at 100% (95% CI, 98 to 100), followed by RealTime MTB at 96.7% (95% CI, 92.9 to 98.8; P=0.03) and the Ultra at 95.6% (95% CI, 91.5 to 98.1; P=0.08). In patients with smear-negative disease, the Ultra was more sensitive than the Xpert MTB/RIF (64.7% [95% CI, 38.3 to 85.8] versus 41.2% [95% CI, 18.4 to 67.1], respectively; P=0.12), and RT-MTB performed equally to Xpert MTB/RIF. In a comparison of the Ultra and RT-MTB on the same sputum specimen pellets, the Ultra was more sensitive than RT-MTB in the overall cohort (88.9% [95% CI, 77.4 to 95.8] versus 77.8% [95% CI, 64.4 to 88], respectively; P=0.03) and among people with HIV (87.5% [95% CI, 71 to 96.5] versus 68.6% [95% CI, 50 to 83.9], respectively; P=0.03). Although these results did not reach statistical significance, they suggest that the Ultra is more sensitive than the Xpert MTB/RIF and RT-MTB, most prominently in smear-negative disease. This was accompanied by a loss of specificity."

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert in presumptive pulmonary TB patients in Southwestern Uganda. DESIGN: We obtained demographic and clinical information and collected three sputum samples from each patient for smear microscopy, Xpert and culture. We estimated Xpert sensitivity and specificity against culture, and stratified the analysis by previous treatment and sputum quality status. RESULTS: We analyzed results from 860 presumptive TB patients, including 109 (13%) with a previous history of anti-tuberculosis treatment; 205 (24%) were culture-positive. Xpert specificity was lower (91.8%, 95%CI 84.9-96.2) in previously treated than in new TB patients (97.5%, 95%CI 96.1-98.5; P = 0.01). In an adjusted analysis, patients with culture-, Xpert+ results were more likely to have been previously treated for TB (OR 8.3, 95%CI 2.1-32.0; P = 0.002), and to have mucosalivary sputum (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.1-14.6; P = 0.03), but were less likely to self-report fever (OR 0.23, 95%CI 0.1-0.7; P = 0.008) than patients with concordant positive results. CONCLUSION: Xpert specificity was lower in previously treated patients with suspected TB. The clinical and programmatic impact of culture-, Xpert+ results requires evaluation in future studies."

This causes discomfort to patients, with risks of bleeding and iatrogenic infections, and requires technical expertise. Molecular tests have great potential for diagnosis of VL using peripheral blood, but require well-equipped facilities and trained personnel. More user-friendly, and field-amenable options are therefore needed. One method that could meet these requirements is loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) using the Loopamp Leishmania Detection Kit, which comes as dried down reagents that can be stored at room temperature, and allows simple visualization of results. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Loopamp Leishmania Detection Kit (Eiken Chemical Co., Japan), was evaluated in the diagnosis of VL in Sudan. A total of 198 VL suspects were tested by microscopy of lymph node aspirates (the reference test), direct agglutination test-DAT (in house production) and rK28 antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (OnSite Leishmania rK39-Plus, CTK Biotech, USA). LAMP was performed on peripheral blood (whole blood and buffy coat) previously processed by: i) a direct boil and spin method, and ii) the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAgen). Ninety seven of the VL suspects were confirmed as cases by microscopy of lymph node aspirates. The sensitivity and specificity for each of the tests were: rK28 RDT 98.81% and 100%; DAT 88.10% and 78.22%; LAMP-boil and spin 97.65% and 99.01%; LAMP-QIAgen 100% and 99.01%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Due to its simplicity and high sensitivity, rK28 RDT can be used first in the diagnostic algorithm for primary VL diagnosis, the excellent performance of LAMP using peripheral blood indicates that it can be also included in the algorithm for diagnosis of VL as a simple test when parasitological confirmatory diagnosis is required in settings that are lower than the reference laboratory, avoiding the need for invasive lymph node aspiration."

We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of implementation a new algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) related sepsis among PLHIV presenting with life-threatening illness. METHODS: This study is a prospective cohort conducted in three-referral hospitals in Kilimanjaro, recruited 97 PLHIV from February through June 2018. Patients provided urine and sputum samples for testing lateral flow - lipoarabinomannan (LF-LAM) and Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)/rifampicin (RIF) assays, respectively. Anti-TB was prescribed to patients with positive LF-LAM or Xpert MTB/RIF or received broad-spectrum antibiotics but deteriorated. RESULTS: Of 97 patients, 84 (87%) provided urine and sputa, and 13 (13%) provided only urine. The mean age (95% confidence interval) was 40 (38-43) years and 52 (54%) were female. In 84 patients, LF-LAM increased TB detection from 26 (31%) by Xpert MTB/RIF to 41 (55%) by both tests. Of 97 patients, 69 (71%) prescribed anti-TB, 67% (46/69) and 33% (23/69) had definitive and probable TB respectively. Sixteen (16.5%) patients died, of which one died before treatment, 73% (11/15) died within 7 days of admission. The 30-day survival was similar in both treatment groups (log rank = 0.1574). Mortality was significantly higher among hospitalized patients compared to outpatients (P  0.027). CONCLUSION: Implementation of new algorithm increased TB case detection in patients that could have been missed by Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Survival of PLHIV with confirmed or probable TB was comparable to those of PLHIV that were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics alone. Further work should focus on the optimal timing and content of the immediate antimicrobial regimen for sepsis among PLHIV in TB-endemic settings."

All patients had a clinical exam and LAM, chest X-ray, sputum microscopy, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) requested. Culture in sputum was done for a subset of patients. The diagnostic yield was defined as the proportion of patients with a positive assay result among those with laboratory-confirmed TB. For the 456 patients included in the study, the median age was 36 years (IQR 31-43) and the median CD4 count was 50 cells/l (IQR 21-108). Forty-five percent (205/456) of the patients had laboratory-confirmed TB. The diagnostic yields of LAM, microscopy, and Xpert were 82.4% (169/205), 33.7% (69/205), and 40.0% (84/205), respectively. In total, 50.2% (103/205) of the patients with laboratory-confirmed TB were diagnosed only through LAM. Overall, the use of LAM in diagnostic algorithms increased the yield of algorithms with microscopy and with Xpert by 38.0% (78/205) and 34.6% (71/205), respectively, and, specifically among patients with CD4 100-199 cells/l, by 27.5% (14/51) and 29.4% (15/51), respectively. LAM-positive patients not diagnosed through other tools and not treated for TB had a significantly higher risk of mortality than LAM-positive patients who received treatment (adjusted risk ratio 2.57, 95% CI 1.27-5.19, p = 0.009). Although the TB diagnostic conditions in the study sites were similar to those in other resource-limited settings, the added value of LAM may depend on the availability of microscopy or Xpert results. CONCLUSIONS: LAM has diagnostic value for identifying TB in HIV-positive patients with signs and symptoms of TB and advanced immunodeficiency, including those with a CD4 count of 100-199 cells/l. In this study, the use of LAM enabled the diagnosis of TB in half of the patients with confirmed TB disease; without LAM, these patients would have been missed. The rapid identification and treatment of TB enabled by LAM may decrease overall mortality risk for these patients."

To scrutinize the association between Alu methylation and tuberculosis (TB) disease in children, the difference in Alu DNA methylation level was compared with healthy controls. METHODS: Whole-blood genomic DNA from 36 TB-infected children and 32 healthy controls was isolated, and the level of Alu repeat DNA methylation was examined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The median Alu methylation level in TB patients was 30% (Interquartile range [IQR], 25-30%), whereas in healthy controls, it was 75% (IQR, 50-75%) (P < 0.0001). The median level of DNA methylation of Alu RE in TB cases was significantly lower than healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve for diagnosis was 0.969 (95% confidence interval, 0.936-1) (P < 0.0001), with 100% sensitivity and 84% specificity. CONCLUSION: Our results point out that detection of Alu DNA methylation in whole-blood DNA may be clinically useful tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of TB disease in children."

This method is designed for use at the point-of-care (particularly in resource-limited settings). By combining recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)- an isothermal alternative to the polymerase chain reaction - with an electroactive mediator, this electrochemical methodology enables accurate detection of DNA in the field using a low-cost, portable electrochemical analyzer (specifically designed for this type of analysis). This handheld device has four attributes: (1) It uses disposable, paper-based strips that incorporate screen-printed carbon electrodes; (2) It accomplishes thermoregulation with 0.1C temperature accuracy; (3) It enables electrochemical detection using a variety of pulse sequences, including square-wave and cyclic voltammetry, and coulometry; (4) It is operationally simple to use. Detection of genomic DNA from Mycobacterium smegmatis (a surrogate for M. tuberculosis-the main cause of tuberculosis), and from M. tuberculosis itself down to 0.040ng/L provides a proof-of-concept for the applicability of this method of screening for disease using molecular diagnostics. With minor modifications to the reagents, this method will also enable field monitoring of food and water quality."

METHODS: From June 2011 to September 2012 we prospectively enrolled children with symptoms or signs suggestive of tuberculosis at three research centres in Tanzania and Uganda. After clinical assessment, respiratory specimens were collected for microscopy and culture, as well as whole blood for Xpert() MTB/RIF. Children were classified according to standardised case definitions. RESULTS: A total of 232 children were evaluated; 14 (6.0%) had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. The Xpert() MTB/RIF assay detected M. tuberculosis in 5/232 (2.2%) blood samples with 1 (0.4%) error reading and presumably 1 (0.4%) false-positive result. The sensitivity of the assay in children with culture-confirmed (1/14) versus no tuberculosis (1/117) was 7.1% (95% CI, 1.3-31.5).

We evaluated the diagnostic utility of enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays in HIV-uninfected patients with suspected TBM. METHODS: All HIV-uninfected patients with suspected TBM were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary care hospital in an intermediate TB-burden country, during a 6-year period. ELISPOT assays were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and cerebrospinal fluid-mononuclear cells (CSF-MC). RESULTS: Of the 276 evaluable patients, 90 (33%) were classified as having TBM (30 definite cases, 19 probable, and 41 possible), and 186 (67%) as having non-TBM. When comparing definite TBM versus non-TBM, the sensitivity and specificity of the PBMC ELISPOT assay (6 spots; manufacturer's recommended cut-off) for diagnosing TBM were 96% (95% CI, 82-100) and 58% (95% CI, 50-66), respectively. The CSF-MC ELISPOT assay (38 spots; receiver operating characteristic [ROC]-derived cut-off) was a useful rule-in test with specificity of 95% (96% CI, 90-98). Its sensitivity was 68% (95% CI, 45-86), which was superior those of AFB smear microscopy (14%; P < 0.001) and CSF Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR (41%; P = 0.07). Combining this assay with M. tuberculosis PCR, clinical score, and both together increased sensitivity to 86%, 91%, and 95%, respectively, while retaining about 95% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The CSF-MC ELISPOT assay appears to be a rapid and accurate rule-in test for the diagnosis of TBM and a useful adjunct for diagnosing TBM in HIV-uninfected patients."

We hypothesized that combining serum antibody with urine lipoarabinomannan (U-LAM) detection can improve the detection of HIV-associated TB. METHODS: We performed a case-control study with sampling from a prospective study of South African HIV-infected subjects who were screened for TB prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy. Sera from all available TB cases (n = 74) and randomly selected non-TB controls (n = 30), all tested for U-LAM, sputum microscopy, GeneXpert, and cultures, were evaluated for antibodies to LAM and arabinomannan (AM). Diagnostic logistic regression models for TB were developed based on the primary test results and the additive effect of antibodies with leave-one-out cross-validation. RESULTS: Antibody responses to LAM and AM correlated strongly (p<0.0001), and IgG and IgM reactivities were significantly higher in TB than non-TB patients (p<0.0001). At 80% specificity, the target specificity for a non-sputum-based simple triage/screening test determined by major TB stakeholders, combining U-LAM with IgG detection significantly increased the sensitivity for HIV-associated TB to 92% compared to 30% for U-LAM alone (p<0.001). Sputum microscopy combined with IgG detection increased sensitivity to 88% compared to 31% for microscopy alone, and Xpert with IgG increased sensitivity to 96% and 99% compared to 57% for testing one, and 70% for testing two sputa with Xpert alone, respectively. CONCLUSION: Combining U-LAM with serum antibody detection could provide a simple low-cost method that meets the requirements for a non-sputum-based test for the screening of HIV-associated TB."

While widely used, immunodiagnostics can produce false negative or false positive results. Pathogen biomarkers provide an alternative, but direct detection in LTBI and extrapulmonary TB cases is challenging. Mycobacterium tuberculosis grows slowly, has limited hematogenous movement, is protected by a lipid rich cell wall, and produces low levels of secreted factors. Here we discuss the potential of elicitors by first considering pathogen markers that may be released following the administration of isoniazid. Isoniazid targets the cell wall of mycobacteria found in extracellular compartments and within monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphatic endothelial cells. Isoniazid's dual-purpose potential as an antibiotic and elicitor is supported by knowledge of latent infection dynamics, time-kill kinetics, and new detection techniques. Within hours, the bactericidal action of isoniazid likely enriches plasma with M. tuberculosis DNA, RNA, proteins/peptides, and lipids. Undoubtedly a portion of these biomarkers are eliminated as some bacilli undergo phagocytosis and lysosomal destruction. However, advances in immunoprecipitation and nucleic acid amplification, combined with the use of larger blood volumes during assay development, may overcome these losses. Other anticipated challenges include determining optimal sample collection times and designing diagnostic workflows that minimize processing-associated marker loss and degradation. Conventional, commercial, and emerging technologies that address these variables are discussed. If realized, isoniazid associated markers could provide proof of concept for novel elicitor-based diagnostic approaches capable of confirming LTBI and empirically treated extrapulmonary TB."

Antiretroviral treatment (ART) is the most effective way to reduce the risk of TB in HIV-1 co-infected people. Studying protective, ART-induced, immune restoration in HIV-1 infected individuals sensitised by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can thus help identify mechanisms of protection against TB. In order to understand ART-mediated prevention of TB in HIV-1 infected adults, we investigated the expression of 30 genes in whole blood from HIV-1 infected patients during the first 6 months of ART-induced immune reconstitution. The 30 selected genes were previously described to be differentially expressed between sorted Mtb specific central and effector memory CD4 T cells. HIV-1 infected persons sensitised by Mtb were recruited in Khayelitsha, South Africa, when initiating ART. RNA was extracted from whole blood at initiation and 1, 3 and 6 months of ART. qRT-PCR was used to determine gene expression and three reference 'housekeeping' genes were used to calculate the fold change in the expression of each gene relative to day 0 of ART. Results were assessed longitudinally. We observed a decrease in the expression of a number of genes at 6 months of ART, reflecting a decrease in immune activation. However, following correction for multiple comparisons and increasing CD4 counts, only the decrease in CD27 gene expression remained statistically significant. While not statistically significant, a number of genes also showed increased expression at various timepoints, illustrating the broad regeneration of the T cell pool in HIV-1 infected adults on ART. Our findings generate hypotheses underlying ART- induced protective immune reconstitution and may pave the way for future studies to evaluate ART mediated prevention of TB in HIV-1 infected persons."

The first milestone being the 1959 Madras trial comparing home and sanatorium treatment in South India. Subsequently, the MRC trials led Fox and Mitchison to indicate rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide as the first line drugs for short course, 6 month, regimens and the 1982 Hong Kong Chest Service trials established intermittent therapy as the ambulatory treatment standard for directly observed therapy (DOT). The rising of the HIV epidemic at the beginning of the 1980s has refuelled tuberculosis spread in Africa and Asia and contributed to the expansion of drug-resistant tuberculosis worldwide making the development of new drugs and drug regimens for ambulatory treatment a top priority. Led by biotechnological advances, molecular biology has been brought into TB laboratory diagnosis for the highly sensitive and specific rapid identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in biological samples. The field of immunological diagnosis of TB infection, dominated since the early 1900s by the intradermal tuberculin reaction has been put back in motion by the discovery of M. tuberculosis-specific proteins and peptides, now employed in blood tests of high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of latent TB which may help with the identification of contacts at higher risk of active disease and the eradication of epidemic cases."

This recommendation results in unnecessary Xpert MTB/RIF testing in many individuals living in tuberculosis-endemic areas and thus poor implementation of intensified case finding and tuberculosis preventive therapy. Novel approaches to tuberculosis screening are needed to help achieve global targets for tuberculosis elimination. We assessed the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP) measured with a point-of-care assay as a screening tool for active pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: For this prospective study, we enrolled adults (aged 18 years) living with HIV with CD4 cell count less than or equal to 350 cells per L who were initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) from two HIV/AIDS clinics in Uganda. CRP concentrations were measured at study entry with a point-of-care assay using whole blood obtained by fingerprick (concentration 10 mg/L defined as screen positive for tuberculosis). Sputum samples were collected for Xpert MTB/RIF testing and culture. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of point-of-care CRP and WHO symptom-based screening in reference to culture results. We repeated the sensitivity analysis with Xpert MTB/RIF as the reference standard. FINDINGS: Between July 8, 2013, and Dec 15, 2015, 1237 HIV-infected adults were enrolled and underwent point-of-care CRP testing. 60 (5%) patients with incomplete or contaminated cultures were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1177 patients (median CD4 count 165 cells per L [IQR 75-271]), 163 (14%) had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Point-of-care CRP testing had 89% sensitivity (145 of 163, 95% CI 83-93) and 72% specificity (731 of 1014, 95% CI 69-75) for culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Compared with WHO symptom-based screening, point-of-care CRP testing had lower sensitivity (difference -7%, 95% CI -12 to -2; p=0002) but substantially higher specificity (difference 58%, 95% CI 55 to 61; p<00001). When Xpert MTB/RIF results were used as the reference standard, sensitivity of point-of-care CRP and WHO symptom-based screening were similar (94% [79 of 84] vs 99% [83 of 84], respectively; difference -5%, 95% CI -12 to 2; p=010). INTERPRETATION: The performance characteristics of CRP support its use as a tuberculosis screening test for people living with HIV with CD4 count less than or equal to 350 cells per L who are initiating ART. HIV/AIDS programmes should consider point-of-care CRP-based tuberculosis screening to improve the efficiency of intensified case finding and increase uptake of tuberculosis preventive therapy.

Regular TB screenings using the intradermal tuberculin test (TST) have been the mainstay of TB surveillance and control in NHPs. Historically, Aotus monkeys have been considered less susceptible to TB than other NHPs. Here we present the diagnosis and epidemiology of a TB outbreak at The Gorgas Memorial Institute Aotus colony in Panama, and the results of two cross-sectional randomized TB screening studies, using antibody (Ab) and IFN-gamma release assay testing. RESULTS: Epidemiological and spatial analysis confirmed that the outbreak was the result of a continuing intermittent exposure, with human to monkey transmission as the most likely source. During the outbreak that lasted five months (January-June 2015), Mycobacterium kansassi and MTB were isolated from lung caseous granulomas in 1/7 and 3/7 TB suspicious animals respectively. Furthermore, MTB was detected by qRT-PCR in formalin fixed lung and liver granulomas in 2/7 and 1/6 monkeys respectively, suggesting an aerosol route of infection. Likewise, a random sample that included 63 / 313 adult (>2 year-old) monkeys, screened for latent TB with the Primagam IFN-gamma release assay, between March-May, 2016, were all non-reactors; indicating that the outbreak was self-limiting and the colony was likely free or latent TB infection. Control measures included, quarantine, disinfection and TST screening of all personnel. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Aotus are highly susceptible to TB, therefore, TB prevention measures should be strictly enforced in Aotus monkey colonies."

Receiver operating characteristic, tree classification and random forest analyses were applied to evaluate the discriminatory power of the three genes and find the gene panel most predictive of patients' disease classification. Tree classification produced a model based on GBP5 and CD64 expression. In random forest analysis, the combination of the three genes provided a robust biosignature to distinguish TB from OPD with 95% specificity and 93% sensitivity. Our results suggest that GBP5 and CD64 in tandem may be the most predictive combination. However, GZMA contribution to the prediction model requires further investigation. Regardless, these three genes show promise as a rapid diagnostic marker separating TB from OPD."

The identified miRNAs were subsequently verified by real-time qPCR. Target gene prediction and miRNA-gene network construction were further explored. A total of 119 miRNAs were identified to be in different levels between any two groups of the study population by microarray (Fold Change>2, p<0.01). 11 most promising miRNAs were then selected for verification by real-time qPCR. The levels of hsa-let-7b-5p and hsa-miR-30b-5p were confirmed to be significantly up-regulated in pulmonary TB patients as compared to both control groups (p<0.01). Caspase 3 was predicted to be one common target gene for these two miRNAs. None of the selected miRNA was confirmed to be related with the infection status.

The main aim this study is to evaluate the role of neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis and bacterial Community-Acquired Pneumonia at Ayder and Mekelle hospitals, Mekelle, Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to May 2017 on a total of 146 patients at Ayder and Mekelle hospitals. After taking written informed consent, study participants were interviewed for a detailed history and 5 mL of blood was collected for hematological analysis. Pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed by using Ziehl-Neelsen and Gene X-pert. Community acquired pneumonia was diagnosed using sputum culture. Student's t-test, Pearson's chi-square test, and receiver operating characteristics curve analysis were used. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio and eythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly higher in pulmonary tuberculosis patients than bacterial community-acquired pneumonia patients. Neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio and eythrocyte sedimentation rate with cutoff values of 2.72 and  39, respectively, showed the highest area under the curve (AUC = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio and eythrocyte sedimentation rate together at a time with their respective cutoff values gave a 69% accuracy in differentiating pulmonary tuberculosis from bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. Therefore, neutrophil to lymphocyte count ratio and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be used in differentiating pulmonary tuberculosis from PTB patients from bacterial Community-acquired pneumonia, especially in resource-limited settings."

Ongoing research on biomarkers for TB infection may lead to new tests for blood, urine, breath, and sputum. Sustained investment in the development and dissemination of diagnostic tests for TB is critical for increasing TB case finding, placing patients on appropriate treatment, and reducing transmission."

It frequently causes massive vitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment leading to blindness. Although the exact etiology is unknown, this condition is considered to be a consequence of hypersensitivity reaction to tubercular protein due to previous Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) infection. This study is aimed at the detection of association of M. tuberculosis in patients with Eales' disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective case-control study was undertaken in 65 clinically diagnosed cases of Eales' disease. Patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy, neo-vascular proliferation, macular oedema, premacular fibrosis and tractional retinal detachment were taken as controls. M. tuberculosis DNA was detected (MPT64 gene by polymerase chain reaction, PCR) in patients with Eales' disease. Clinical symptoms along with tuberculin skin test (TST) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were used as gold standard for comparing results of PCR. RESULT: PCR positivity was found in 12 (38.7%) patients with Eales' disease. The PCR positivity was significantly associated with the patients with high TST reading and high ESR values. CONCLUSION: Patients with a high TST reading and ESR value and a positive PCR in vitreous samples have a high likelihood of having M. tuberculosis as an etiology."

METHODS: The study involved 30 patients admitted with suspected TBP from January-December 2016; three patients were later excluded. The interferon- release assay (T-SPOT.TB) and the Xpert MTB/RIF test were performed using peripheral blood and pericardial tissues, respectively. TBP was confirmed using pericardial histopathology and a composite reference standard (CRS). We analyzed the sensitivity, specificity, predictive value (PV), likelihood ratio (LR), and area under curve (AUC) of both assays. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were confirmed as TBP, 10 as non-TBP, and 3 as probable TBP. The sensitivity, specificity, positive PV (PPV), negative PV (NPV), PLR, NLR, and AUC (95% confidence interval [CI]) of the Xpert MTB/RIF assay were 78.6% (49.2-95.3%) and 70.6% (44.0-89.7%); 92.3% (64.0-99.8%) and 100% (69.2-100%); 91.7% (61.5-99.8%) and 100% (73.5-100%); 80.0% (51.9-95.7%) and 66.7% (38.4-88.2%); 10.21 (1.52-68.49) and the PLR value was undefined with CRS as the reference; 0.23 (0.08-0.64) and 0.29(0.14-0.61); and 0.854 (0.666-0.959) and 0.853 (0.664-0.959), against histopathology and CRS, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, PLR, NLR, and AUC values (95% CI) of T-SPOT.TB were 92.9% (66.1-99.8%) and 94.1% (71.3-99.9%); 15.4% (1.9-45.5%) and 20.0% (2.5-55.6%); 54.2% (32.8-74.5%) and 66.7% (44.7-84.4%); 66.7% (9.4-99.2%) and 66.7% (9.4-99.2%); 1.10 (0.83-1.44) and 1.18 (0.84-1.6); 0.46 (0.05-4.53) and 0.29 (0.03-2.85); and 0.541(0.340-0.733) and 0.571(0.367-0.758), against histopathology and CRS, respectively. The differences in sensitivity, PPV, and AUC of Xpert MTB/RIF and T-SPOT.TB were not statistically significant (P > 0.05), compared to those of histopathology and CRS. However, the differences in specificity and NPV of the two assays were significant (P < 0.05), compared to those of histopathology and CRS. CONCLUSIONS: Xpert MTB/RIF test is a valid diagnostic technique for TBP with higher sensitivity and specificity than T-SPOT.TB."

Current diagnostic methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and sputum culture, are time-consuming and cannot prevent the rapid spreading of TB during the diagnostic period. In this connection, detecting biomarkers specific to TB at molecular level in plasma of patients will provide a rapid means for diagnosis. In this study, we first evaluated the differential expression of the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the plasma from patients with TB (TB positive), community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthy individuals (CG) using lncRNA microarray scanning. It was found that there were 2116 specific lncRNAs differentially expressed in the TB positive samples (1102 up-regulated and 1014 down-regulated), which accounted for 6.96% of total lncRNAs. Twelve differentially expressed lncRNAs discovered in microarray were subsequently validated by using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Two lncRNAs (ENST00000354432 and ENST00000427151) were further validated with more Tuberculosis samples. These results suggested the expression level of lncRNAs and the two validated lncRNAs in plasma could be the potential molecular biomarkers for the rapid diagnosis of Tuberculosis."

Moreover, a subset of low-density neutrophils (LDNs) has been identified in TB, but their functions remain unclear. Here, we have analyzed total neutrophils and their low-density and normal-density (NDNs) subsets in patients with active TB disease, in terms of frequency, phenotype, functional features, and gene expression signature. Full-blood counts from Healthy Donors (H.D.), Latent TB infected, active TB, and cured TB patients were performed. Frequency, phenotype, burst activity, and suppressor T cell activity of the two different subsets were assessed by flow cytometry while NETosis and phagocytosis were evaluated by confocal microscopy. Expression analysis was performed by using the semi-quantitative RT-PCR array technology. Elevated numbers of total neutrophils and a high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio distinguished patients with active TB from all the other groups. PBMCs of patients with active TB disease contained elevated percentages of LDNs compared with those of H.D., with an increased expression of CD66b, CD33, CD15, and CD16 compared to NDNs. Transcriptomic analysis of LDNs and NDNs purified from the peripheral blood of TB patients identified 12 genes differentially expressed: CCL5, CCR5, CD4, IL10, LYZ, and STAT4 were upregulated, while CXCL8, IFNAR1, NFKB1A, STAT1, TICAM1, and TNF were downregulated in LDNs, as compared to NDNs. Differently than NDNs, LDNs failed to phagocyte live Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) bacilli, to make oxidative burst and NETosis, but caused significant suppression of antigen-specific and polyclonal T cell proliferation which was partially mediated by IL-10. These insights add a little dowel of knowledge in understanding the pathogenesis of human TB."

The development of an effective and sensitive detection method is urgently needed for bacterial load evaluation in vaccine development, early TB diagnosis, and TBtreatment. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is a newly developed sensitive PCR method for the absolute quantification of nucleic acid concentrations. Here, we used ddPCR to quantify the circulating virulent M. tb-specific CFP10 (10-kDa culture filtrate protein, Rv3874) and Rv1768 DNA copy numbers in the blood samples from Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-vaccinated and/or virulent M. tb H37Rv-challenged rhesus monkeys. We found that ddPCR was more sensitive compared to real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR), as the detection limits of CFP10 were 1.2 copies/l for ddPCR, but 15.8 copies/l for qPCR. We demonstrated that ddPCR could detect CFP10 and Rv1768 DNA after 3 weeks of infection and at least two weeks earlier than qPCR in M.tb H37Rv-challenged rhesus monkey models. DdPCR could also successfully quantify CFP10 and Rv1768 DNA copy numbers in clinical TB patients' blood samples (active pulmonary TB, extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), and infant TB). To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that ddPCR is an effective and sensitive method of measuring the circulating CFP10 and Rv1768 DNA for vaccine development, bacterial load evaluation in vivo, and early TB (including EPTB and infant TB) diagnosis as well."

METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 135 Warao indigenous individuals with newly diagnosed sputum culture-positive TB. Of these, 24 were diagnosed with active tuberculosis (ATB). The study comprised 111 participants, who were grouped as follows: 1) 14 tuberculin skin test (TST)-positive Warao indigenous individuals and 4 that were QuantiFERON-TB?Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT) test-positive, collectively comprising the latent TB infection group (LTBI), n = 18), and 2) healthy controls who were QFT-IT- and TST-negative, comprising the control group (CTRL, n = 93). Detection of the IFN  gene (IFNG) +874A/T polymorphism was performed via PCR and quantification of IFNG expression via qPCR. RESULTS: Relative to indigenous and white Americans, ATB and CTRL groups had a higher frequency of the IFNG SNP (+874A): 23 (95.8%) and 108 (97.3%), respectively. Indigenous Warao individuals homozygous for the IFNG (+874) A allele exhibited 3.59-fold increased risk of developing TB (95% confidence interval, 2.60-4.96, p =0.0001). A decreased frequency of the AT genotype was observed in individuals with pulmonary TB (4.16%) and controls (0.90%). The frequency of the TT genotype was decreased among controls (1.80%); none of the patients with TB were found to have this genotype. The differences in IFNG expression between the groups, under unstimulated and stimulated conditions, were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results demonstrate concordance between IFNG +874 A/A genotype and low expression of IFNG."

In 2015, there are estimated 950,000 cases of childhood TB. Since most TB in children is paucibacillary, this gives rise not only to problem in diagnosing but also in monitoring the response to anti-TB treatment as well. Soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein of various cells of immune system, is one of the potential biomarkers to be used in the management of TB. The objective of this study is to study the decrease of serum suPAR level after anti-TB treatment in children with TB and its association with patient characteristics. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study on children suspected of having TB due to a history of contact with active TB case and symptoms such as coughing, fever, and enlarged lymph nodes. The diagnosis of TB is established by history, physical examination including anthropometric examination. Tuberculin skin test using PPD RT-23 and interferon-gamma releasing assay with Quantiferon TB-Gold Plus was performed. Chest X-rays were read by two independent radiologists. Microbiological examination was performed using microscopic examination and Xpert MTB/RIF. The level of suPAR before and after anti-TB treatment was examined with the Elisa method. RESULTS: There was no significant difference of serum suPAR levels before and after anti-TB treatment (mean 0.71 [standard deviation 0.585] ng/mL; P = 0.072). There was no association between ages (P = 0.112), nutritional status (P = 0.228), diagnosis of pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB (P = 0.956), and radiological feature (P = 0.810) with serum suPAR levels decrease.

We sought to compare the sensitivity of two alternative method of pooling. METHODS: Patients referred for assessment for TB, whose initial sputum was Xpert MTB positive, were recruited and their sputum specimens were pooled for analysis with sputum specimens that were Xpert MTB negative. Two alternative pooling strategies were employed: one in which the concentration of sample reagent (buffer) was maintained at 2:1 (standard), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and another in which the concentration of sample reagent was reduced to 1:1. RESULTS: We tested 101 Xpert MTB positive sputum specimens. Among these, 96% of valid test results (95% confidence interval (CI) 89-99%) were positive using the ""standard buffer method"". Using the ""reduced buffer pooling"" method 94% of valid test results (95% CI 87-98%) were positive. McNemar's test for the difference in paired proportions did not reach statistical significance (P=0.56). CONCLUSION: We have confirmed that pooling of two sputum specimens for testing in a single cartridge is a valid method of reducing the number of cartridges required when using Xpert MTB to detect pulmonary tuberculosis. Two alternative pooling strategies tested here yielded similar results. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present study was conducted within the Active Casefinding in Tuberculosis (ACT3) Trial.

FCGR1A, FCGR1B variant 1, FCGR1B variant 2, APOL1, GBP5, PSTPIP2, STAT1, KCNJ15, MAFB and KAZN had significantly higher expression level in active TB individuals as compared with healthy controls and previous TB cases (P<0.01). A mathematical method was applied to calculate TB predictive score, which contains the level of expression of seven genes and this score can identify active TB cases with 82.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity as compared with conventional culture confirmation. In addition, TB predictive scores in active TB patients were reduced to normal after completion of standard short-course therapy, which was mostly in concordant with the disease outcome. These finding suggested that blood gene expression measurement and TB Sick Score could have potential value in terms of diagnosis of TB and anti-TB treatment monitoring."

DESIGN: Consecutive smear or Xpert MTB/RIF-positive adult (age 18 years) pulmonary TB patients were recruited between June 2015 and March 2016. Venous blood was tested using QFT-Plus. The sensitivity was defined as the number positive divided by the total number tested. Using logistic regression, factors associated with positive QFT-Plus results were explored. RESULTS: Of 108 patients (median age 32 years, interquartile range 27-38; 73% male; 63% human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] positive), 90 were QFT-Plus-positive, 11 were negative and seven had indeterminate results; sensitivity was 83% (95%CI 75-90).

In models adjusted for age alone, CD4 cell count <100 cells/l (OR 0.15, 95%CI 0.02-0.96; P = 0.05) and body mass index <18.5 kg/m2 (OR 0.27, 95%CI 0.08-0.91; P = 0.02) were associated with decreased odds of positive QFT-Plus results. CONCLUSION: Overall, the sensitivity of QFT-Plus is similar to that of the tuberculin skin test and other IGRAs. While overall sensitivity is not affected by HIV status, QFT-Plus sensitivity was lower among people living with HIV/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome with severe immunosuppression."

We calculated diagnostic yield, sensitivity, specificity, and other indicators for Xpert for each stratum of sputum quality in reference to a standard of mycobacterial culture. RESULTS: Patients with salivary sputum showed a trend towards a substantially higher proportion of samples that were Xpert-positive (54/286, 19%, 95% CI 15-24) compared with those with all other sputum sample types (221/1496, 15%, 95% CI 13-17). Blood-stained sputum produced the lowest sensitivity (28%; 95% CI 12-49) and salivary sputum the highest (66%; 95% CI 53-77). Specificity didn't vary meaningfully by sample types. Salivary sputum was significantly more sensitive than mucoid sputum (+13%, 95% CI +1 to +26), while blood-stained sputum was significantly less sensitive (-24%, 95% CI -42 to -5). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the need to exercise caution in collecting sputum for Xpert and in interpreting results because sputum quality may impact test yield and sensitivity. In particular, it may be wise to pursue additional testing should blood-stained sputum test negative while salivary sputum should be readily accepted for Xpert testing given its higher sensitivity and potentially higher yield than other sample types. These findings challenge conventional recommendations against collecting salivary sputum for TB diagnosis and could inform new standards for sputum quality."

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, sputum and blood samples were collected from 304 adult patients in rural Andhra Pradesh. Rifampin resistance was assessed by Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert), and diabetes status was based on self-report. Additionally, samples were assayed by acid-fast bacilli sputum smear microscopy (AFB) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-G), in order to compare relative diagnostic performances. RESULTS: Among patients with confirmed TB (n = 194), diabetes was associated with 3.0-fold higher risk of rifampin resistance (95 % CI 1.3-6.7). Considering Xpert MTB/RIF the gold standard, AFB had lower sensitivity (72.2 vs. 82.5 %) and higher specificity (96.4 vs. 37.0 %) compared to QFT-G for diagnosing TB. CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of rifampin resistance in patients with diabetes highlights the need for integrated diabetes surveillance in TB programs, particularly in settings undergoing the epidemiological transition."

Blood culture is currently the standard test for the detection of MTB in whole blood but results take weeks; patients deteriorate markedly and often die before a diagnosis of blood stream TB is made. Rapid molecular tests on whole blood, with potential for same day diagnosis of blood stream TB usually show low sensitivity due to the problem of insufficient MTB DNA template when extraction is performed directly on low blood volumes. This study assessed the influence of blood volume on the sensitivity of a HyBeacon PCR assay-the FluoroType MTB (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) on direct detection of MTB in whole blood. METHODS: Prospective recruitment of HIV-positive patients with clinical suspicion of blood stream TB but not on anti-TB or HIV drug treatment was done. Venous blood samples were collected and DNA extracted using the MolYsis (Molzym, Bremen, Germany) methods; for study A, from duplicate 1 ml (42 patients) and for study B (31 patients) from 9 ml EDTA blood samples. The FluoroType MTB PCR assay targeting an IS6110 sequence was performed and results compared with blood culture. RESULTS: The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the FluoroType MTB PCR in study A was 33% and 97%, respectively. Corresponding values in study B were 71% and 96%, respectively. In both studies, one case each of blood culture-negative blood stream TB was detected with the FluoroType MTB PCR assay. The median time to positivity of blood culture was 20.1 (range 12-32) for study A and 19.9 days (range 15-30) for study B. CONCLUSION: Larger blood volumes (9 ml) improved and gave acceptable sensitivity of direct PCR diagnosis of blood stream TB."

What has changed, and dramatically, is the importance of speedy and accurate TB diagnosis and the difficulty of achieving this. The disproportionate amount of smear-negative disease in sub-Saharan Africa, which shoulders two-thirds of the global burden of HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, has greatly complicated TB case detection and disease control. Now, 15 years after TB rates began to soar in countries where HIV infection is prevalent, we have learned that the conventional approach -- passively waiting for patients with advanced symptomatic disease to make their way to microscopy centers for diagnosis -- has disastrous consequences. Without better diagnostic tools for TB and effective strategies for their implementation, transmission will not be interrupted, mortality will not be checked, and TB will not be controlled in areas where HIV infection is prevalent. Fortunately, a number of technical opportunities exist for the creation of improved diagnostic tests. Developing and exploiting such tests to support TB control in HIV-infected populations is an urgent priority. A substantial public sector effort is under way to work in partnership with the biotechnology industry to accelerate progress toward that goal. In this article, we will define the need for better TB tests and describe technologies being developed to meet that need."

However, the factors contributing to the maintenance of latent infection vs. disease progression are poorly understood. In this study, we used a genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach to identify host factors associated with M. tuberculosis infection status and a novel gene signature that can distinguish active disease from latent infection. By RNA-seq, we characterized transcriptional differences in purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) among three groups: patients with active tuberculosis (ATB), individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI), and TB-uninfected controls (CON). A total of 401 differentially expressed genes enabled grouping of individuals into three clusters. A validation study by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed the differential expression of TNFRSF10C, IFNG, PGM5, EBF3, and A2ML1 between the ATB and LTBI groups. Additional clinical validation was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of these five biomarkers using 130 subjects. The 3-gene signature set of TNFRSF10C, EBF3, and A2ML1 enabled correct classification of 91.5% of individuals, with a high sensitivity of 86.2% and specificity of 94.9%. Diagnostic performance of the 3-gene signature set was validated using a clinical cohort of 147 subjects with suspected ATB. The sensitivity and specificity of the 3-gene set for ATB were 82.4 and 92.4%, respectively. In conclusion, we detected distinct gene expression patterns in PBMCs stimulated by PPD depending on the status of M. tuberculosis infection. Furthermore, we identified a 3-gene signature set that could distinguish ATB from LTBI, which may facilitate rapid diagnosis and treatment for more effective disease control."

MiRNAs (miRNAs) participate in TB progression by modulating the host-pathogen interaction. Bioinformatics advancements provide basis for exploring novel immunoregulatory miRNAs and their performance as diagnostic biomarkers. Gene and miRNA expression datasets, GSE29190 and GSE54992, were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Based on fold changes and statistical significance, a total of 7463 differentially expressed mRNAs (DE-mRNAs) and 38 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were screened. Function annotation and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were constructed to reveal underlying mechanisms of TB pathogenesis. Functional annotation identified the MAPK signalling pathway and leukocyte migration as the top enriched processes. The PPI and MGIP networks indicated that chemokine ligands like CXCL1/CXCL2 and receptors, like CCR7 were important down-regulated genes, implying that a protective mechanism against overdue inflammation induced cell death. MiRNA-gene-immune processes (MGIP) network enriched 7 deregulated miRNAs, and their expression was further examined with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), in PBMC samples of 20 active TB patients and 20 healthy donors. The diagnostic performance was evaluated with ROC curves. MiR-892b; miR-199b-5p and miR-582-5p were significantly deregulated in TB patients, compared with healthy participants. The best overall performance was from miR-892b, with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.77, 55% sensitivity and 90% specificity. AUC of miR-199b-5p and miR-582-5p were 0.71 and 0.70, respectively.

The yield of these tests used in combination for the diagnosis of active TB among HIV-infected TB suspects is unknown. DESIGN: Study of comparative diagnostic accuracy nested into a prospective study of HIV-infected individuals with signs and/or symptoms of TB in Uganda. METHODS: Xpert testing of archived sputum was conducted for culture-confirmed TB cases and TB suspects in whom a diagnosis of TB was excluded. Additional testing included sputum smear microscopy, sputum culture (solid and liquid media), mycobacterial blood culture, and urinary testing for LAM using a lateral flow test ('LF-LAM') and an enzyme-linked immunosorbance assay ('ELISA-LAM'). RESULTS: Among 103 participants with culture-confirmed TB, sensitivity of Xpert was 76% (95% confidence interval, CI 0.66-0.84), and was superior to that of LF-LAM (49%, 95% CI 0.39-0.59, P < 0.001). Specificity was greater than 97% for both tests among 105 individuals without TB. The combination of smear microscopy and LF-LAM identified 67% (95% CI 0.57-0.76) of culture-confirmed TB cases and approached sensitivity of Xpert testing alone (P = 0.15). The sensitivity of the combination of Xpert and LF-LAM was 85% (88/103 95% CI 0.77-0.92), which was superior to either test alone (P < 0.05) and approached sensitivity of sputum liquid culture testing (94%, 95% CI 0.88-0.98, P = 0.17).

The quantization of plasma DNA fragments was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Amplifying and quantifying shorter (115bp) and longer (247bp) fragments from abundant genomic ALU repeats. RESULTS: The level of cfDNA (ALU115) in patients with NSCLC [95.67 (51.28, 238.85) ng/l] was significantly higher than that in patients with tuberculosis [59.60 (34.25, 102.53) ng/l, P=0.001] and that in healthy controls [44.66 (24.56, 66.54) ng/l, P=0.001].

All Mtb-infected T2DM mice and 40% of uninfected T2DM mice died within 10 months, whereas all control mice survived. In Mtb-infected mice, T2DM increased the bacterial burden and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in the lungs relative to those in uninfected T2DM mice and infected control mice. Levels of IL-6 also increased. Anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody treatment of Mtb-infected acute- and chronic-T2DM mice increased survival (to 100%) and reduced pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. CD11c+ cells were the major source of IL-6 in Mtb-infected T2DM mice. Pulmonary natural killer (NK) cells in Mtb-infected T2DM mice further increased IL-6 production by autologous CD11c+ cells through their activating receptors. Anti-NK1.1 antibody treatment of Mtb-infected acute-T2DM mice increased survival and reduced pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression. Furthermore, IL-6 increased inflammatory cytokine production by T lymphocytes in pulmonary tuberculosis patients with T2DM. Overall, the results suggest that NK-CD11c+ cell interactions increase IL-6 production, which in turn drives the pathological immune response and mortality associated with Mtb infection in diabetic mice."

However, the test's clinical utility is poorly defined outside sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: The study enrolled consecutive HIV-positive adults at a tertiary referral hospital in Yangon, Myanmar. On enrolment, patients had a LF-LAM test performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clinicians managing the patients were unaware of the LF-LAM result, which was correlated with the patient's clinical course over the ensuing 6months. RESULTS: The study enrolled 54 inpatients and 463 outpatients between July 1 and December 31, 2015. On enrolment, the patients' median (interquartile range) CD4 T-cell count was 270 (128-443) cells/mm(3). The baseline LF-LAM test was positive in 201/517 (39%). TB was confirmed microbiologically during follow-up in 54/517 (10%), with rifampicin resistance present in 8/54 (15%). In the study's resource-limited setting, extrapulmonary testing for TB was not possible, but after 6months, 97/201 (48%) with a positive LF-LAM test on enrolment had neither died, required hospitalisation, received a TB diagnosis or received empirical anti-TB therapy, suggesting a high rate of false-positive results. Of the 97 false-positive tests, 89 (92%) were grade 1 positive, suggesting poor test specificity using this cut-off. Only 21/517 (4%) patients were inpatients with TB symptoms and a CD4 T-cell count of<100cells/mm(3). Five (24%) of these 21 died, three of whom had a positive LF-LAM test on enrolment. However, all three received anti-TB therapy before death - two after diagnosis with Xpert MTB/RIF testing, while the other received empirical treatment. It is unlikely that knowledge of the baseline LF-LAM result would have averted any of the study's other 11 deaths; eight had a negative test, and ofthe three patients with a positive test, two received anti-TB therapy before death, while one died from laboratory-confirmed cryptococcal meningitis. The test was no better than a simple, clinical history excluding TB during follow-up (negative predictive value (95% confidence interval): 94% (91-97) vs. 94% (91-96)). CONCLUSIONS: The LF-LAM test had limited clinical utility in the management of HIV-positive patients in this Asian referral hospital setting."

Implementation of urine-based, routine, point-of-care TB screening is an attractive intervention that might be facilitated by use of a simple, low-cost diagnostic tool, such as the Determine TB-LAM lateral-flow rapid test for HIV-associated TB. METHODS: Sputum, urine and blood samples were systematically obtained from unselected HIV-positive adults within 24hours of admission to a South African township hospital. Additional clinical samples were obtained during hospitalization as clinically indicated. TB was defined by the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in any sample using Xpert MTB/RIF or liquid culture. The diagnostic yield, accuracy and prognostic value of urine-lipoarabinomannan (LAM) testing were determined, but urine-LAM results did not inform treatment decisions. RESULTS: Consecutive HIV-positive adult acute medical admissions not already receiving TB treatment (n=427) were enrolled regardless of clinical presentation or symptoms. TB was diagnosed in 139 patients (TB prevalence 32.6%; median CD4 count 80 cells/L). In the first 24hours of admission, sputum (spot and/or induced) samples were obtained from 37.0% of patients and urine samples from 99.5% of patients (P<0.001). The diagnostic yields from these specimens were 19.4% (n=27/139) for sputum-microscopy, 26.6% (n=37/139) for sputum-Xpert, 38.1% (n=53/139) for urine-LAM and 52.5% (n=73/139) for sputum-Xpert/urine-LAM combined (P<0.01). Corresponding yields among patients with CD4 counts <100 cells/L were 18.9%, 24.3%, 55.4% and 63.5%, respectively (P<0.01). The diagnostic yield of urine-LAM was unrelated to respiratory symptoms, and LAM assay specificity (using a grade-2 cut-off) was 98.9% (274/277; 95% confidence interval [CI] 96.9-99.8). Among TB cases, positive urine-LAM status was strongly associated with mortality at 90days (adjusted hazard ratio 4.20; 95% CI 1.50-11.75). CONCLUSIONS: Routine testing for TB in newly admitted HIV-positive adults using Determine TB-LAM to test urine provides major incremental diagnostic yield with very high specificity when used in combination with sputum testing and has important utility among those without respiratory TB symptoms and/or unable to produce sputum. The assay also rapidly identifies individuals with a poor prognosis."

In India, Melghat is among the tribal regions which consist of highest number of malnutrition cases. Because of the paucity of TB data from these malnourished areas there is an urgent need for the development and evaluation of improved TB diagnostic tests. In the present study, three in house developed diagnostic tests namely TB-Ag(antigen) ELISA, Adenosine deaminase (ADA) estimation and IS6110 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay were investigated for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb.) infection. METHODS: For investigation, blood samples were collected from 128 study subjects from six villages of Melghat tribal area and evaluated using three in house developed assays, namely TB-Ag ELISA, ADA estimation and IS6110 PCR. RESULTS: The TB-Ag ELISA method yielded 83% sensitivity and 94% specificity. The ADA and PCR assay gave a sensitivity of 61% and 49% and specificity of 62% and 98% respectively. A considerable good agreement of 82.81% (k=0.472) between TB-Ag ELISA and PCR was observed. The overall sensitivity of TB-Ag ELISA was significantly higher (p<0.05) than the ADA and PCR while PCR yielded highest specificity among all the three evaluated tests. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the routine use of TB-Ag ELISA can be useful for screening of suspected TB patients in the malnourished population where sophisticated laboratory set up is difficult."

OBJECTIVE: To review the epidemiology, immunopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of pleural TB in HIV-infected patients. METHODS: A literature search from 1950 to June 2011 in MEDLINE was conducted. RESULTS: Two-hundred and ninety-nine studies were identified, of which 30 met the inclusion criteria. The immunopathogenesis as denoted by cells and cytokine profiles is distinctly different between HIV and HIV-uninfected pleural TB disease. Adenosine deaminase and interferon gamma are good markers of pleural TB disease even in HIV-infected patients. HIV-uninfected TB suspects with pleural effusions commonly have a low yield of TB organisms however the evidence suggests that in dually infected patients smear and cultures have a higher yield. The Gene Xpert MTB/RIF assay has significant potential to improve the diagnosis of pleural TB in HIV-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pleural TB in HIV-infected patients has a different immunopathogenesis than HIV-uninfected pleural TB and these findings in part support the differences noted in this systematic review. Research should focus on developing an interferon gamma-based point of care diagnostic test and expansion of the role of Gene Xpert in the diagnosis of pleural TB."

Secondary HLH due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is uncommon. We report a case of tuberculosis-associated HLH in an umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) recipient and discuss its clinical characteristics and challenges. METHODS: Hematologic investigations, bone marrow aspirates, Xpert MTB/RIF test of TB with peripheral blood were performed. Immune modulation with anti-TB therapy was initiated. RESULTS: Subsequent treatment with anti-TB treatment resulted rapid clinical response and disease remission. CONCLUSION: It is important to consider TB as one of the underlying cause of HLH in high-risk patients, particularly those in immunodeficient states. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve the survival rates of patients with tuberculosis-associated HLH."

Point-of-care testing offers rapid turn-around-times, facilitating same day clinical management decisions. To maximize the benefits of such POC testing programs, we need to understand how rapid tests are used in everyday clinical practice. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey study, 400 primary healthcare providers in two cities in South Africa were interviewed on their use of rapid tests in general, and tuberculosis diagnostic practices, between September 2012 and June 2013. Public healthcare facilities were selected using probability-sampling techniques and private healthcare providers were randomly selected from the Health Professional Council of South Africa list. To ascertain differences between the two healthcare sectors 2-sample z-tests were used to compare sample proportions. RESULTS: The numbers of providers interviewed were equally distributed between the public (n = 200) and private sector (n = 200). The most frequently reported tests in the private sector include blood pressure (99.5%), glucose finger prick (89.5%) and urine dipstick (38.5%); and in the public sector were pregnancy (100%), urine dipstick (100%), blood pressure (100%), glucose finger prick (99%) and HIV rapid test (98%). The majority of TB testing occurs in the public sector, where significantly more providers prefer Xpert MTB/RIF assay, the designated clinical TB diagnostic tool by the national TB program, as compared to the private sector (87% versus 71%, p-value >0.0001). Challenges with regard to TB diagnosis included the long laboratory turn-around-time, difficulty in obtaining sputum samples and lost results. All providers indicated that a new POC test for TB should be rapid and cheap, have good sensitivity and specificity, ease of sample acquisition, detect drug-resistance and work in HIV-infected persons. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The existing centralized laboratory services, poor quality assurance, and lack of staff capacity deter the use of more rapid tests at POC. Further research into the practices and choices of these providers is necessary to aid the development of new POC tests."

To prevent the spread of the disease, early diagnosis is crucial. However, current methods of detection require improvement in sensitivity, efficiency or specificity. In the present study, we conducted a microarray experiment, comparing the gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells among individuals with active TB, latent infection, and healthy conditions in a Taiwanese population. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed that most of the differentially expressed genes belonged to immune responses, inflammation pathways, and cell cycle control. Subsequent RT-PCR validation identified four differentially expressed genes, NEMF, ASUN, DHX29, and PTPRC, as potential biomarkers for the detection of active and latent TB infections. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the expression level of PTPRC may discriminate active TB patients from healthy individuals, while ASUN could differentiate between the latent state of TB infection and healthy condidtion. In contrast, DHX29 may be used to identify latently infected individuals among active TB patients or healthy individuals. To test the concept of using these biomarkers as diagnostic support, we constructed classification models using these candidate biomarkers and found the Nave Bayes-based model built with ASUN, DHX29, and PTPRC to yield the best performance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that gene expression profiles in the blood can be used to identify not only active TB patients, but also to differentiate latently infected patients from their healthy counterparts. Validation of the constructed computational model in a larger sample size would confirm the reliability of the biomarkers and facilitate the development of a cost-effective and sensitive molecular diagnostic platform for TB."

DESIGN: The study focused on the standardisation of the Blacklight Card as a new extraction tool and its evaluation using 130 blood samples randomly collected from patients with clinical symptoms of TB. RESULTS: Of 130 cases, PCR was positive in 22 samples (17%). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the PCR assay was respectively 95.7% and 100%; the positive and negative predictive values were respectively 85.1% and 99.2%. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the Blacklight Card may be a useful tool for the rapid diagnosis of disseminated and extra-pulmonary forms of TB as well as in difficult-to-diagnose cases in which a diagnosis is urgently needed due to the severity of the patient's status."

Left untreated, TB mortality is associated with a failure to resolve pulmonary immunopathology. There is currently widespread interest in using vitamin D3 (VitD3) as an adjunct therapy for TB because numerous in vitro studies have shown that VitD3 has direct and indirect mycobactericidal activities. However, to date, there have been no in vivo studies addressing whether VitD3 affects experimental TB outcome. In this study, we used C3HeB/FeJ mice to determine whether dietary VitD3 influences the outcome of experimental TB. We observed that although M. tuberculosis burdens did not differ between mice on a VitD3-replete diet (VitD(HI) mice) and mice on a VitD3-deficient diet (VitD(LO) mice), the inflammatory response in VitD(HI) mice was significantly attenuated relative to VitD(LO) controls. Specifically, the expression of multiple inflammatory pathways was reduced in the lungs at later disease stages as were splenocyte IL12/23p40 and IFN- levels following ex vivo restimulation. Dietary VitD3 also suppressed the accumulation of T cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes and lung granulomatous regions while concomitantly accelerating the accumulation of F4/80(+) and Ly6C/Ly6G(+) lineages. The altered inflammatory profile of VitD(HI) mice also associated with reductions in pulmonary immunopathology. VitD receptor-deficient (vdr(-/-)) radiation bone marrow chimeras demonstrate that reductions in pulmonary TB immunopathology are dependent on hematopoietic VitD responsiveness. Collectively, our data support a model wherein the in vivo role of VitD3 during TB is not to promote M. tuberculosis killing but rather to function through hematopoietic cells to reduce M. tuberculosis-elicited immunopathology."

We utilized transcriptomics analysis, in situ hybridization, and a macrophage/ T cell co-culture system to elucidate the role of  T cells in local immunity to M. bovis infection. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that  T cells upregulated expression of several novel, immune-associated genes in response to stimulation with M. bovis antigen. BCG-infected macrophage/ T cell co-cultures confirmed the results of our RNAseq analysis, and revealed that  T cells from M. bovis-infected animals had a significant impact on bacterial viability. Analysis of T cells within late-stage M. bovis granulomas revealed significant expression of IFN- and CCL2, but not IL-10, IL-22, or IL-17. Our results suggest  T cells influence local immunity to M. bovis through cytokine secretion and direct effects on bacterial burden."

The aim of this study is to explore the utility of dPCR for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA in PTB patient plasma. Total DNA was purified from plasma samples of newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive PTB patients. Copy numbers of MTB-specific genes in the samples were quantified with dPCR assays targeted for IS6110 or gyrB. A total of 33 PTB patients were enrolled. Significant differences between PTB patients and controls were observed in copy numbers of both targets: IS6110 meanSD, 144.8538.3 vs 0.440.49 (copies/20L, p=0.004; Mann-Whitney U test) and gyrB meanSD, 359.02116 vs 0.070.28 (copies/20L, p=0.011; Mann-Whitney U test), respectively.

In cattle infected with M. bovis it is also known that the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine can inhibit in vitro production of IFN- leading to a reduced response in the IFN- diagnostic test. In order to investigate this in greater detail, whole blood samples from tuberculin skin test positive and negative cattle were stimulated with bovine and avian tuberculin antigens and in parallel with a neutralising anti-IL-10 monoclonal antibody. The results showed that IFN- protein levels increased when IL-10 activity was suppressed by Anti - IL-10. By using a standard diagnostic interpretation, the elevated levels of IFN- were shown to change the level of agreement between the performance of the single intradermal comparative tuberculin test (SICTT) and IFN- assay, depending on the tuberculin treatment. A transcriptomic analysis using RT-qPCR investigated the influence of IL-10 activity on expression of a suite of cytokine genes (IFNG, IL12B, IL10 and CXCL10) associated with antigen-stimulated production of IFN-. The IFNG and IL12B genes both experienced significant increases in expression in the presence of Anti-IL-10, while the expression of IL10 and CXCL10 remained unaffected."

However, the performance of the Xpert assay as applied to other readily accessible body fluids such as exhaled breath condensate (EBC), saliva, urine, and blood has not been established. We used the Xpert assay to test EBC, saliva, urine, and blood samples from HIV-negative, smear- and culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients for the presence of M. tuberculosis. To compare the ability of the assay to perform bacterial load measurements on sputum samples with versus without sample processing, the assay was also performed on paired direct and processed sputum samples from each patient. The Xpert assay detected M. tuberculosis in none of the 26 EBC samples (sensitivity, 0.0%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.0%, 12.9%), 10 of the 26 saliva samples (sensitivity, 38.5%; 95% CI, 22.4%, 57.5%), 1 of 26 urine samples (sensitivity, 3.8%; 95% CI, 0.7%, 18.9%), and 2 of 24 blood samples (sensitivity, 8.3%; 95% CI, 2.3%, 25.8%). For bacterial load measurements in the different types of sputum samples, the cycle thresholds of the two M. tuberculosis-positive sputum types were well correlated (Spearman correlation of 0.834). This study demonstrates that the Xpert assay should not be routinely used to detect M. tuberculosis in EBC, saliva, urine, or blood samples from HIV-negative patients suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis. As a test of bacterial load, the assay produced similar results when used to test direct versus processed sputum samples. Sputum remains the optimal sample type for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative patients with the Xpert assay."

The lysis buffer was stable both at room temperature and at 4C for 2 months. The assay was tested with blood stored for 8 days without a change in sensitivity as measured by cycle threshold. This new assay format extends the capability of the Xpert MTB/RIF test, enabling up to 20 ml of blood to be tested rapidly for the presence of M. tuberculosis. This approach may be a useful method to detect extrapulmonary tuberculosis and the risk of death in immunocompromised patients."

To identify a set of such markers, we used Solexa sequencing to examine microRNA expression in the serum of patients with active disease, healthy individuals with latent TB, and those with or without prior BCG inoculation. We identified 24 microRNAs that are up-regulated (2.85-1285.93 fold) and 6 microRNAs that are down-regulated (0.003-0.11 fold) (P<0.05) in patients with active TB relative to the three groups of healthy controls.

Of interest, 134 microRNAs were differentially-expressed in BCG-inoculated relative to un-inoculated individuals (18 up-regulated 2.9-499.29 fold, 116 down-regulated 0.0002-0.5 fold), providing insights into the effects of BCG inoculation at the microRNA level. Target prediction of differentially-expressed microRNAs by microRNA-Gene Network analysis and analysis of pathways affected suggest that regulation of the host immune system by microRNAs is likely to be one of the main factors in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. qRT-PCR validation indicated that hsa-miR-196b and hsa-miR-376c have potential as markers for active TB disease. The microRNA differential-expression profiles generated in this study provide a good foundation for the development of markers for TB diagnosis, and for investigations on the role of microRNAs in BCG-inoculated and latent-infected individuals."

METHODS: Latency of TB infection among Vietnamese healthcare workers was estimated using interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), and serum GNLY concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The levels of GNLY expression in whole blood and the presence of GNLY alleles with the exon-4 polymorphism rs11127 were also determined using PCR-based methods. RESULTS: Among 109 study participants, 41 (37.6 %) were IGRA positive and had significantly lower serum GNLY concentrations compared with IGRA-negative participants (adjusted mean, 95 % confidence interval; 2.03, 1.72-2.44 vs. 2.48, 2.10-2.92 ng/ml, P = 0.0127; analysis of covariance).

Serum GNLY concentrations varied with GNLY genotypes even after adjustment for gender and age (adjusted P = 0.0015) and were moderately correlated with GNLY expression in blood cells (r = 0.40, P < 0.0001). In subsequent analyses, low serum GNLY concentrations were significantly associated with IGRA status (adjusted odds ratio and 95 % confidence interval, 0.55 and 0.31-0.98, respectively), although GNLY genotype and mRNA levels were not. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased GNLY, presumably at the protein level, is linked to the immunological condition of latent TB infection."

The technology for rapid diagnosis of TB and rifampicin (RMP) resistance in pulmonary sputum smear-positive specimens is well advanced, and assays have high specificity with good sensitivity. Nevertheless, the current sensitivity of TB detection means that these assays still cannot replace the standard diagnostic methods for TB or conventional drug susceptibility testing (DST). In extra-pulmonary specimens, the performance of molecular tools varies and should be considered separately for each specimen type. Evidence for the use of these assays for TB and drug resistance detection in individuals co-infected with TB and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is limited. As the positive predictive value for RMP resistance reaches  90% only when the prevalence of RMP resistance in new TB patients is >15%, which is rare globally, many cases with such resistance will be false-resistant, emphasising the need for a secondary confirmative test. Similarly, increased (or incorrect) diagnosis of TB may compromise programme effectiveness by increasing the numbers of individuals requiring anti-tuberculosis treatment, unless it is carefully planned. For the future, 1) assays with greater sensitivity for TB detection are needed; 2) rapid diagnostics for paediatric TB are important, and there is a need for carefully designed studies, including those involving HIV-positive children; 3) more clinical data need to be obtained from longitudinal studies, especially related to the influence of rapid diagnostics on disease outcome; and 4) point-of-care tests using untreated sputum, blood or urine and little or no equipment would be of immeasurable benefit. Although great progress has been made, we are not there yet."

Affinity chromatography was used to purify specific polyclonal antibodies against MTB antigen. Pleural samples after decontamination were treated with proteinase K. Rapid test for pleural fluids was prepared by specific antibody. Rapid test was performed on 85 pleural fluid patients. The patients had a mean age of 46.55  15.96 years and 38 were men. The performance of rapid test, using proteinase K, was found to be the most impressive: sensitivity 93%, specificity 94%, PPV 90%, and NPV 96% compared with adenosine deaminase test (ADA), PCR, smear, and culture. The present study did demonstrate that modified TB rapid test can substantially improve the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB."

In the absence of a functional IL12RB1 allele, individuals exhibit susceptibility to disseminated, recurrent mycobacterial infections that are associated with defects in both RAG1-dependent and RAG1-independent hematopoietic lineages. Despite this well-established association, a causal relationship between M. tuberculosis susceptibility and IL12RB1 deficiency in either RAG1-dependent or RAG1-independent lineages has never been formally tested. Here, we use the low-dose aerosol model of experimental tuberculosis (TB) to both establish that infected il12rb1(-/-) mice recapitulate important aspects of TB in IL12RB1 null individuals and, more importantly, use radiation bone marrow chimeras to demonstrate that restriction of il12rb1 deficiency solely to rag1-dependent lineages (i.e., T and B cells) allows for the full transfer of the il12rb1(-/-) phenotype. We further demonstrate that the protection afforded by adaptive lymphocyte il12rb1 expression is mediated partially through ifng and that, within the same infection, il12rb1-sufficient T cells exhibit dominance over il12rb1-deficient T cells by enhancing ifng expression in the latter population. Collectively, our data establish a basic framework in which to understand how IL12RB1 promotes control of this significant human disease."

However, there is little evidence to demonstrate the presence of MTB in the skin lesions. This study is aimed at evaluating the association between MTB infection and the development of EN and NV in a Chinese population. METHODS: A total of 107 patients (36 EN, 27 NV, and 44 others) with vasculitis and 40 control cases with other skin diseases were recruited and their skin lesion samples were subjected to real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the IS6110 and mpt64 gene fragments of MTB. Their blood mononuclear cells were tested for MTB antigen-specific IFN- responses by QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (IT) assays. RESULTS: PCR analysis revealed that 7/23 (30.4%) and 7/18 (38.9%) of the EN and NV samples were positive for the IS6110 DNA, respectively, which were significantly higher than 3/34 (8.8%) of other vasculitis (OV) and 3/40 (7.5%) of the control samples (p<0.05). The nested Real-Time PCR assay indicated that 6/7 (86%) of the IS6110-positive EN samples, all of the IS6110-positive NV and control samples, but only 1/3 of the IS6110-positive OV samples, were positive for the mpt64 gene. Similarly, 19/32 (59.4%) of the EN patients, 20/26 (76.9%) of the NV patients, and 17/36 (47.2%) of the OV patients were positive for MTB antigen-specific IFN- responses, which were significantly higher than 6/40 (15%) of the controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our data strongly suggest that MTB infection and active TB are associated with the development of NV and EN in Chinese."

Lack of concrete immune markers is still the obstacle to properly evaluate active TB. Therefore, identification of more validated biomarkers and phenotypic signatures is imperative. In particular, T cell-related biomarkers are more significant. METHODOLOGY: To understand the nature of CD4(+) T cell-derived signatures involved in infection and disease development, we examined and analyzed whole genome expression profiles of purified CD4(+) T cells from healthy individuals (HD), two distinct populations with latent infection (with low or high IFN- levels, LTB(L)/LTB(H)) and untreated TB patients. Following, we validated the expression profiles of genes in the peripheral CD4(+) T cells from each group and examined secretion levels of distinct cytokines in serum and pleural effusion. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our bio-informatic analyses indicate that the two latent populations and clinical TB patients possess distinct CD4(+) T cell gene expression profiles. Furthermore, The mRNA and protein expression levels of B cell activating factor (BAFF), which belongs to the TNF family, and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) were markedly up-regulated at the disease stage. In particular, the dramatic enhancement of BAFF and APRIL in the pleural effusion of patients with tuberculosis pleurisy suggests that these proteins may present disease status. In addition, we found that the BAFF/APRIL system was closely related to the Th1 immune response. Our study delineates previously unreported roles of BAFF and APRIL in the development of tuberculosis, and these findings have implications for the diagnosis of the disease. Our study also identifies a number of transcriptional signatures in CD4(+) T cells that have the potential to be utilized as diagnostic and prognostic tools to combat the tuberculosis epidemic."

However, very little information is available on the role of host genetic factors in HIV-TB coinfection. Hence, a longitudinal study was undertaken to investigate HLA associations in a cohort of HIV seropositive individuals with and without TB in Bangalore, South India. METHODS: A cohort of 238HIV seropositive subjects were typed for HLA-A, B, and DR by PCR-SSP and followed up for 5 years or till manifestation of Tuberculosis. HLA data of 682HIV Negative healthy renal donors was used as control. RESULTS: The ratio of males and females in HIV cohort was comparable (50.4% and 49.6%). But the incidence of TB was markedly lower in females (12.6%,) than males (25.6%). Further, HLA-B*57 frequency in HIV cohort was significantly higher among females without TB (21.6%, 19/88) than males (1.7%, 1/59); P = 0.0046; OR = 38. CD4 counts also were higher among females in this cohort. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that HIV positive women with HLA-B*57 have less occurrence of TB as compared to males."

Xpert MTB/RIF's accuracy for diagnosing extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) was investigated. EPTB specimens (n = 7,916) from hospitalized patients received over a 6-month period at a high-throughput TB referral laboratory in Johannesburg were investigated. Large-volume specimens were centrifuged, tissue biopsy specimens homogenized, and all specimens checked for growth of contaminating bacteria on blood agar. Contaminated samples received NALC-NaOH (N-acetyl-l-cysteine-sodium hydroxide) decontamination prior to liquid culture. Residual specimens (volumes > 1 ml) after inoculation of culture (n = 1,175) were tested using the Xpert MTB/RIF sputum protocol. Using culture as the reference, Xpert MTB/RIF's overall sensitivity was 59% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 53% to 65%) and specificity was 92% (CI, 90% to 94%), with the highest sensitivities of 91% (95% CI, 78% to 97%) for pus, 80% (95% CI, 56% to 94%) for lymph node aspirates, and 51% (95% CI, 44% to 58%) for fluids (ascitic, 59%; pleural, 47%). A difference in sensitivities was noticed between specimens classified as having a thick (87% [95% CI, 76% to 94%]) versus clear (watery) (48% [95% CI, 36% to 61%]) appearance. This was unchanged with traces of blood (52% [95% CI, 44% to 60%]) or precentrifugation (57% [95% CI, 28% to 82%]) among clear specimens. Xpert MTB/RIF generated an additional 124 specimen results that were contaminated by Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tubes (MGIT; 10.5%) and diagnosed rifampin (RIF) resistance earlier (9.6% [25/260]). Xpert MTB/RIF's performance on EPTB specimens provides very promising results and should be considered for incorporation into national TB guidelines. Xpert MTB/RIF is less affected by contaminating bacteria and reduces laboratory labor and diagnostic delay compared to traditional methods."

This study evaluated a Single tube nested-PCR (STNPCR) to detect genomic DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in blood and urine. METHODS: Biological samples were obtained from children (<15 years old) with clinical suspicion of pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB at public hospitals in Recife-Pernambuco, Brazil. Cultures yielded negative results in a majority of childhood TB cases, which are generally paucibacillary. A set of clinical, epidemiological, radiological, and laboratory criteria with evident clinical improvement after anti-TB treatment were frequently used to define childhood TB cases. RESULTS: Ninety children with clinical suspicion were enrolled in this study (44 with TB and 46 without TB). The pulmonary TB group had 20 confirmed cases and 46 negative controls, while the extrapulmonary TB group had 24 confirmed cases. The STNPCR showed sensitivities to pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB of 47.4% and 52.2% (blood) and 38.8% and 20% (urine), respectively. Considering the low performance of STNPCR on separate samples, we decided to perform a combined analysis (parallel sensitivity analysis) of the results from blood and urine samples. The parallel sensitivity increased to 65% in blood and 62.5% in urine. The specificity in both samples ranged from 93.5-97.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Although STNPCR showed moderate sensitivity, the specificity is high; therefore, the test can be used as an auxiliary tool to diagnose TB in children. It is a rapid test that demonstrated better performance than other diagnostic tests in paucibacillary samples as it does in childhood tuberculosis."

Acinetobacter baumannii can be isolated from various sites in the hospital environment like medical equipment, bed linen, medical personnel and indwelling catheters. It is difficult to treat A. baumannii infections because of their highly resistant antimicrobial profiles. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of -lactamase genes in multidrug-resistant (MDR) clinical A. baumannii isolates using Multiplex-PCR (M-PCR) assays. METHODS: One hundred MDR A. baumannii isolates were collected from the diagnostic division of the Department of Medical Microbiology after routine analysis of the submitted specimens. All collected isolates were identified and tested for susceptibility using the VITEK 2 system (bioMrieux, France). Six isolates were excluded from this study because the isolates were incorrectly identified as A. baumannii with the VITEK 2 system (bioMrieux, France). Molecular tests, namely M-PCR assays, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed. MLST analyses were performed on representative isolates from the four major pulsotypes (5 isolates with 80 % similarity) and selective isolates from each minor pulsotype. RESULTS: All the A. baumannii isolates showed 100 % resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, cefuroximine axetil, cefoxitin, cefotaxime and nitrofurantoin. Seven percent of the isolates were resistant to amikacin. Two percent of the isolates were classified as having intermediate susceptibility to tigecycline. A. baumannii isolates showed an antibiotic resistance profile of 67 % and higher to antibiotics, such as ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. None of the isolates were resistant to colistin. The M-PCR assays showed that 99 % of the isolates contained the OXA-51 gene and 77 % contained the OXA-23 gene. None of the isolates contained the GES, GIM, IMP, KPC, NDM, OXA-24, OXA-58, PER, SIM, SPM, VEB and VIM genes. Representative A. baumannii isolates were grouped into five existing sequence types (ST): ST106, ST258, ST339, ST502, ST758 and ST848. Isolates belonging to the pan-European clonal lineages I and II (EUI and EUII) were identified. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of MDR A. baumannii isolates has a severe impact on available treatment choices and this in return impacts on treatment outcomes in the studied healthcare facilities. The most dominant ST among the collected isolates was ST758, member of the EUI group. The presence of the OXA-23 gene was not restricted to a specific ST. Continuous research and surveillance is necessary to monitor the circulating -lactamase genes in clinical settings to guide infection control policies in order to try and curb the spread of this bacterium."

We have recently characterized a Wistar rat model of experimental tuberculosis (TB). In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of BCG vaccination in this model. Upon Mtb challenge, BCG vaccinated rats controlled growth of the bacilli earlier than unvaccinated rats. Histopathology analysis of infected lungs demonstrated a reduced number of granulomatous lesions and lower parenchymal inflammation in vaccinated animals. Vaccine-mediated protection correlated with the rapid accumulation of antigen specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the infected lungs. Immunohistochemistry further revealed higher number of CD8(+) cells in the pulmonary granulomas of vaccinated animals. Evaluation of pulmonary immune responses in vaccinated and Mtb infected rats by real time PCR at day 15 post-challenge showed reduced expression of genes responsible for negative regulation of Th1 immune responses. Thus, early protection observed in BCG vaccinated rats correlated with a similarly timed shift of immunity towards the Th1 type response. Our data support the importance of (i) the Th1-Th2 balance in the control of mycobacterial infection and (ii) the value of the Wistar rats in understanding the biology of TB."

This study evaluated single-tube nested polymerase chain reaction (STNPCR) as a molecular diagnostic test with low risk of cross contamination for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis in clinical samples. METHODS: Mycobacterium tuberculosis deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected in blood and urine samples by STNPCR followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In this system, reaction tubes were not opened between the two stages of PCR (simple and nested). RESULTS: STNPCR demonstrated good accuracy in clinical samples with no cross contamination between microtubes. Sensitivity in blood and urine, analyzed in parallel, was 35%-62% for pulmonary and 41%-72% for extrapulmonary TB. The specificity of STNPCR was 100% in most analyses, depending on the type of clinical sample (blood or urine) and clinical form of disease (pulmonary or extrapulmonary). CONCLUSIONS: STNPCR was effective in detecting TB, especially the extrapulmonary form for which sensitivity was higher, and had the advantage of less invasive sample collection from patients for whom a spontaneous sputum sample was unavailable. With low risk of cross contamination, the STNPCR can be used as an adjunct to conventional methods for diagnosing TB."

The conventional diagnostic tests are time-consuming and have a low sensitivity. Digital PCR is a novel technology which can detect target sequences with relatively low abundance and obtain the absolute copy numbers of the targets. METHODS: We assessed the accuracy of dPCR in TB diagnosis using more than 250 specimens, and for the first time, we selected M.tuberculosis-specific IS1081 in addition to widely used IS6110 as the amplification targets for dPCR. The quantification of target DNA was calculated using QuantaSoft Version 1.7.4.0917 (BioRad), and SPSS version 13.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: IS6110-dPCR was more sensitive than IS1081, with the sensitivity and specificity accounting for 40.6 and 93.4% respectively. When we classified the TB patients by personal factors for high copy number of M.tuberculosis derived DNA in plasma: bilateral TB, extrapulmonary TB and disseminated TB, the sensitivity of both IS6110- and IS1081- dPCR was the highest in patients with disseminated TB (IS6110, 100%; IS1081, 68.8%), while their sensitivity was a bit higher in patients with extrapulmonary TB (IS6110, 50.0%; IS1081, 39.3%) than that in bilateral TB (IS6110, 43.3%; IS1081, 33.3%). Compared with traditional TB diagnostic tests, joint detection IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR was not as sensitive as smear microscope or mycobacterial culture, but it was higher than IS6110 qPCR (p<0.05) and was able to detect 47.4% of smear-negative TB patients. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that plasma IS6110-dPCR is a rapid, moderate accurate and less-invasive method to detect M.tuberculosis DNA in plasma of TB patients and IS6110 & IS1081-dPCR has a potential to aid diagnosis of smear-negative TB."

We determined whether neutrophil counts in peripheral blood are associated with tuberculosis (TB) and with mycobacterial load in sputum in HIV-infected patients. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Adults enrolling in an antiretroviral treatment (ART) clinic in a Cape Town township were screened for TB regardless of symptoms. Paired sputum samples were examined using liquid culture, fluorescence microscopy, and the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. Absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were measured in blood samples. Of 602 HIV-infected patients screened, 523 produced one or more sputum samples and had complete results available for analysis. Among these 523 patients, the median CD4 count was 16910(9)/L (IQR, 96-232) and median ANC was 2.610(9)/L (IQR, 1.9-3.6). Culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 89 patients. Patients with TB had a median ANC of 3.410(9)/L (IQR, 2.4-5.1) compared to 2.510(9)/L (IQR, 1.8-3.4) among those who were culture negative (p<0.0001). In multivariable analyses, having pulmonary TB was associated with an adjusted risk ratio (aRR) of 2.6 (95%CI, 1.5-4.5) for having an ANC level that exceeded the median value (ANC 2.610(9)/L; p=0.0006) and an aRR of 6.8 (95%CI, 2.3-20.4) for having neutrophilia defined by a neutrophil count exceeding the upper limit of the normal range (ANC >7.510(9)/L; p=0.0005). Patients were then classified into four mutually exclusive groups with increasing sputum mycobacterial load as defined by the results of culture, Xpert MTB/RIF and sputum smear microscopy. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that increasing sputum mycobacterial load was positively associated with blood ANC 2.610(9)/L and with neutrophilia. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Increased blood neutrophil counts were independently associated with pulmonary TB and sputum mycobacterial burden in this HIV-infected patient group. This observation supports the growing body of literature regarding the potential role for neutrophils in the host response to TB."

These include regulatory cytokines such as IL-10 by regulatory B-cells. Furthermore, a rare regulatory subset of B-cells have the potential to express FasL, which is a death-inducing ligand. This subset of B-cells have a positive role during autoimmune disease, but has not yet been studied during tuberculosis. These FasL-expressing B-cells are induced by bacterial LPS and CpG, thus we hypothesized that this phenotype might be induced during tuberculosis as well. METHODS: B-cells from participants with TB (at diagnosis and during treatment) and controls were collected, and analyzed by means of real-time PCR and flow cytometry. In addition to this, BAL was collected from TB participants as well and analyzed by means of MAGPix (multi-cytokine) technology. RESULTS: Gene expression analysis show that FASL transcript levels increase by the end of treatment. Similarly, phenotypic analysis show that there is a higher frequency of FasL-expressing B-cells by the end of treatment. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results indicate that these FasL-expressing B-cells are being induced during anti-TB treatment, and thus may play a positive role. Further studies are required to elucidate this."

We prospectively evaluated the usefulness of PCR performed in blood and urine samples from patients with proved or probable TB compared with a control group of patients. The PCR technique was performed using IS6110 primers. We included in the study 57 patients (43 with definite TB and 14 with probable TB) and 26 controls. Blood and urine samples were drawn at the time of microbiologic diagnosis and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months later. Cultures were positive in the early period (<1 month after treatment) in 11 of 57 patients (19%) with probable or definite TB, in comparison with 42% of patients (24/57) who yielded a positive PCR (P = 0.02). Urine samples increased the sensitivity of PCR determination in blood samples by 10%. The PCR in blood and/or urine was positive in 41% of patients with pulmonary TB, in 36% of patients with extrapulmonary TB, and in 50% of patients with disseminated TB. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was still detectable by PCR in 5 of 13 patients with cured TB after 1 or more months of antituberculous treatment. The PCR detection of M. tuberculosis in blood and urine samples is useful for the diagnosis of different clinical forms of TB, mostly in those patients in which sample extraction is difficult or requires aggressive techniques. The sensitivity of this technique could be improved studying more than 1 sample in each patient, even after initiating an antituberculous treatment."

The lesions were characterized by smooth marginal zones and space-occupying mass appearance. The considerable loss of spongy bone in the thoracolumbar vertebrae resulted in angular deformity and fusion, characteristic of the healing stage of TB. Osteolytic lesions were also observed on the vertebral processes, ribs and sternum. On the endocranial surface, abnormal blood vessel impressions were revealed, indicating some kind of meningitis. The X-ray and CT analysis of the affected bones detected abnormal structures and cystic zones of destruction. The lesions were however not always bordered by areas of increased density, which is typical in cystic TB. Vertebral remains were also subjected to biomolecular analysis in two different laboratories, which attested the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) DNA and supported the paleopathological diagnosis of TB. Spoligotyping analysis confirmed the presence of MTBC DNA and more specifically an infection caused by bacteria belonging to the M. tuberculosis lineage. This case study provides new data for the paleoepidemiology of TB in this geographical area and historical period, and draws attention to the great variability of TB lesions in the human skeleton."

We assessed the prevalence of TB among those with HIV-related anemia and evaluated new means of rapid TB diagnosis. METHODS: Blood hemoglobin levels were measured in unselected antiretroviral treatment-naive patients in Cape Town, South Africa, and anemia was classified according to World Health Organization criteria. All patients were screened for TB by testing paired sputum samples using liquid culture (reference standard), fluorescence microscopy, and Xpert MTB/RIF. Urine samples were tested for lipoarabinomannan (LAM) using the Determine TB-LAM diagnostic assay. RESULTS: Of 602 adults screened, 485 had complete results. Normal hemoglobin levels were found in 44.5% (n = 216) of patients, and mild, moderate, or severe anemia were present in 24.9% (n = 121), 25.4% (n = 123) and 5.2% (n = 25) of patients, respectively. Culture-confirmed pulmonary TB was diagnosed in 8.8% (19/216) of those without anemia compared with 16.5% (20/121), 26.0% (32/123), and 40.0% (10/25) among those with mild, moderate, or severe anemia, respectively (P < 0.001). Anemia was a strong independent predictor of TB. The sensitivities of diagnostic assays were much higher among those with moderate/severe anemia compared with those with no/mild anemia using sputum microscopy (42.9% vs 15.4%), urine LAM (54.8% vs 0%), sputum microscopy plus urine LAM (71.4% vs 15.4%), and sputum Xpert (73.8% vs 41.0%) (P < 0.01 for all). CONCLUSIONS: A very high prevalence of undiagnosed TB was found in patients with moderate or severe anemia. Such patients should be prioritized for routine microbiological investigation using rapid diagnostic assays."

We undertook this study to compare nonculture amplification-based DNA analysis with conventional culture of disc aspirate. METHODS: Nineteen patients with spondylodiscitis, including 11 with a history of spinal surgery, presented with negative blood cultures and underwent percutaneous disc or epidural abscess puncture for bacterial diagnosis. Amplification by polymerase chain reaction was performed on 16S ribosomal DNA universal target genes and femA staphylococci-specific target genes in all patients, and on the upstream p34 mycobacterial gene in 1 patient. Species identification relied on amplicon sequencing and comparison with templates from GenBank. Amplification of the femA gene led to subsequent testing for methicillin resistance by amplification of the mecA gene. Further assessment using a staphylococci- and methicillin resistance-specific DNA array was performed on 3 samples. RESULTS: Microbiologic and molecular assays identified the causative organism in 14 of 19 patients (74%) and 19 of 19 patients (100%), respectively. In culture-positive patients, DNA-based and microbiologic results were highly correlated. Five agents (Staphylococcus simulans, Staphylococcus sciuri, Brucella species, Actinomyces israelii, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex) were identified only by DNA-based methods. In 1 sample, Corynebacterium jeikeium and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were both cultured, whereas DNA analysis identified only Staphylococcus hominis. CONCLUSION: DNA-based methods are highly sensitive and specific. They can usefully complement standard microbiologic methods for identifying the cause of infectious spondylodiscitis and contribute to species-specific therapeutic orientation in patients with negative blood and disc aspirate cultures."

In this study, we have evaluated the levels of selected miRNAs in serum of TB and MDR TB patients. In addition, we have studied their levels in serum of patients post-therapy. The levels of 4-miRNAs (miR-16, miR-29a, miR-125b and miR-155) were measured in 30 newly diagnosed TB patients, 19 Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) TB patients, 10 patients who completed TB therapy and were TB negative. 30 healthy individuals were recruited as controls. The levels of the miRNAs were estimated by qRT-PCR. Of the four miRNAs studied, the levels of miR-16 were significantly elevated and miR-155 were significantly reduced in serum of TB patients as compared to uninfected controls. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of miR-16 and miR-155 exhibited a significant distinguishing efficiency with an AUC value of 1 (95% CI, 1 to 1) and 0.967 (95% CI, 0.92-1.04) respectively. Following the therapy, the levels of miR-16 and miR-155 returned to those observed in healthy subjects. In patients with MDR TB, miR-155 was lower as compared to healthy controls and TB treated group but higher as compared to TB nave patients. miR-16 levels were lowest in serum of MDR TB patients compared to TB nave, TB treated group and healthy controls. In conclusion, miR-16 and miR-155 in serum may act as surrogate biomarker for studying TB infection, progression of therapy and MDR TB."

A soluble factor, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (D4GDI), produced by apoptotic CD4(+)CD25(+) (85% Foxp3(+)) cells is responsible for this inhibition of M. tb growth in human macrophages and in mice. M. tb-expanded CD4(+C)D25(+)Foxp3(+)D4GDI(+) cells do not produce IL-10, TGF- and IFN-. D4GDI inhibited growth of M. tb in MDMs by enhancing production of IL-1, TNF- and ROS, and by increasing apoptosis of M. tb-infected MDMs. D4GDI was concentrated at the site of disease in tuberculosis patients, with higher levels detected in pleural fluid than in serum. However, in response to M. tb, PBMC from tuberculosis patients produced less D4GDI than PBMC from persons with LTBI. M. tb-expanded CD4+CD25+ (85% Foxp3(+)) cells and D4GDI induced intracellular M. tb to express the dormancy survival regulator DosR and DosR-dependent genes, suggesting that D4GDI induces a non-replicating state in the pathogen. Our study provides the first evidence that a subpopulation of CD4(+)CD25(+) (85% Foxp3+) cells enhances immunity to M. tb, and that production of D4GDI by this subpopulation inhibits M. tb growth."

METHODS: Web-based survey of Paediatric-Tuberculosis-Network-European-Trialsgroup (ptbnet) and Tuberculosis-Network-European-Trialsgroup (TBnet) members conducted June to December 2013. Both networks comprise clinicians, microbiologists, epidemiologists and researchers predominately based in Europe. RESULTS: 191 healthcare professionals from 31 European countries participated. Overall, 26.8% of respondents did not have access to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay; only 44.6% had access to the assay in-house. However, a substantial proportion had access to other commercial and/or non-commercial PCR-based assays for TB (68.8% and 31.8%, respectively). Only 6.4% did not have access to any PCR-based assays for TB. A large proportion of participants with access to the Xpert MTB/RIF assay had used it for the analysis of non-respiratory samples [pleural fluid: 36.5%, gastric aspirates: 34.7%, cerebrospinal fluid: 34.7%, stool samples: 4.3%, blood/serum: 2.6%, 'other samples' (which included biopsy/tissue samples, lymph node aspirates, joint aspirates and urine samples): 16.5%]. Regarding interferon-gamma release assays, a greater proportion of respondents had access to the QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay (84.7%) than to the T-SPOT.TB assay (52.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Both immunological and molecular TB tests are widely available across Europe. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay is more widely used than the T-SPOT.TB assay, which may reflect the difficulties of integrating an ELISPOT assay into the routine laboratory setting. Although Xpert MTB/RIF assays are optimised and solely licensed for the analysis of sputum samples, in clinical practice they are commonly used for non-respiratory samples. Further research is needed to establish how current molecular TB tests impact on patient care and outcome in the routine clinical setting."

METHODS: A prospective double-blind study with 37 hospitalized patients of both sexes, aged over 15, was used to investigate the diagnosis of pleural effusion. The criteria used to define the cases included the demonstration of bacillus in biological samples by smear or culture or by a granulomatous finding in the histopathological examination, associated with an evident response to specific treatments to each clinical situation. Pleural fluid, blood and urine samples were collected and subjected to routine tests and the nested PCR technique to assess for M. tuberculosis amplification. RESULTS: In total, 37 pleural effusion patients took part in the study, of whom 19 (51.3%) had tubercular etiologies and 18 (48.7%) had etiologies from other causes. When the pleural fluid, blood and/or urine sample in-house nested-PCR sensitivities were evaluated simultaneously, the results were positive regardless of the biological specimen (the sensitivity was 84.2%); however, when the blood and/or urine samples were analyzed together, the sensitivity was 72.2%. When the pleural fluid samples were evaluated alone, the sensitivity was only 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of the diagnostic pleural tuberculosis nested-PCR was directly related to the diversity of the samples collected from the same patient. Additionally, this study may identify a need to prioritize non-invasive blood and urine collection for this diagnosis."

We hypothesized that PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 would be highly expressed in untreated tuberculosis patients compared to controls due to their chronic infection and would decrease with successful TB treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Untreated tuberculosis patients (n = 26) were recruited at diagnosis and followed up during treatment. Household contacts (n = 24) were recruited to establish baseline differences. Blood gene expression ex vivo was investigated using qRT-PCR. Flow cytometry was performed to establish protein expression patterns. RESULTS: PD-L1 gene expression was found to be elevated in active TB disease; however, this was not observed for PD-1 or PD-L2. The intensive phase of TB treatment was associated with a significant decline in PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 gene expression. PD-1 protein expression on the surface of NK cells, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was similar in patients with active TB disease compared to controls but declined with successful TB treatment, with the greatest decline occurring on the NK cells followed by CD8+ T cells and then CD4+ T cells. Granzyme B/PD-1 co-expression declined with successful intensive phase treatment. CONCLUSION: Modulation of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway through TB treatment indicates changes in the peripheral T cell response caused by live Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) followed by the response to dead bacilli, antigen-release and immuno-pathology resolution. The PD-1 axis could be a host drug target for immunomodulatory treatments in the future."

Recently, the Gene-Xpert platform, a rapid, PCR-based diagnostic platform, has been validated for the diagnosis of TB with sputum. We have evaluated the Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteremia and investigated its impact on clinical outcomes. Consecutive HIV-infected adults with fever and cough presenting to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, were recruited and followed up for 2 months. At presentation, three sputum samples were examined by smear, culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the presence of M. tuberculosis and blood was drawn for PCR with Xpert, for mycobacterial culture (Myco/F Lytic), and for aerobic culture. One hundred four patients were recruited, and 44 (43%) were sputum culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Ten were Xpert blood positive, for a sensitivity of 21% and a specificity of 100%. The 2-week mortality rate was significantly higher among patients who were Xpert blood positive than among those who were negative (40% versus 3%; multivariate odds ratio [OR] for death if positive, 44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3 to 662). This effect persisted on assessment of the mortality rate at 2 months (40% versus 11%; OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 24.6). When screening uncomplicated patients presenting with a productive cough for pulmonary TB, Xpert blood offers no diagnostic advantage over sputum testing. Despite this, Xpert blood positivity is highly predictive of early death and this test rapidly identifies a group of patients in urgent need of initiation of treatment."

A possible link between particulate air pollutant exposure and antimycobacterial immunity has not been explored in human primary immune cells. We hypothesized that exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP), a major component of urban fine particulate matter, suppresses antimycobacterial human immune effector cell functions by modulating TLR-signaling pathways and NF-B activation. We show that DEP and H37Ra, an avirulent laboratory strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, were both taken up by the same peripheral human blood monocytes. To examine the effects of DEP on M. tuberculosis-induced production of cytokines, PBMC were stimulated with DEP and M. tuberculosis or purified protein derivative. The production of M. tuberculosis and purified protein derivative-induced IFN-, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 was reduced in a DEP dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 remained unchanged. Furthermore, DEP stimulation prior to M. tuberculosis infection altered the expression of TLR3, -4, -7, and -10 mRNAs and of a subset of M. tuberculosis-induced host genes including inhibition of expression of many NF-B (e.g., CSF3, IFNG, IFNA, IFNB, IL1A, IL6, and NFKBIA) and IFN regulatory factor (e.g., IFNG, IFNA1, IFNB1, and CXCL10) pathway target genes. We propose that DEP downregulate M. tuberculosis-induced host gene expression via MyD88-dependent (IL6, IL1A, and PTGS2) as well as MyD88-independent (IFNA, IFNB) pathways. Prestimulation of PBMC with DEP suppressed the expression of proinflammatory mediators upon M. tuberculosis infection, inducing a hyporesponsive cellular state. Therefore, DEP alters crucial components of antimycobacterial host immune responses, providing a possible mechanism by which air pollutants alter antimicrobial immunity."

Due to limitations of the currently available model systems, there are still comparably large gaps in the knowledge about the pathogenesis of these chronic inflammatory diseases in particular with regard to the human host. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the initial phase of mycobacterial infections utilizing a human ex vivo lung tissue culture model designated STST (Short-Term Stimulation of Tissues). METHODS: Human lung tissues from 65 donors with a size of 0.5-1 cm(3) were infected each with two strains of three different mycobacterial species (M. tuberculosis, M. avium, and M. abscessus), respectively. In order to preserve both morphology and nucleic acids, the HOPE fixation technique was used. The infected tissues were analyzed using histo- and molecular-pathological methods. Immunohistochemistry was applied to identify the infected cell types. RESULTS: Morphologic comparisons between ex vivo incubated and non-incubated lung specimens revealed no noticeable differences. Viability of ex vivo stimulated tissues demonstrated by TUNEL-assay was acceptable. Serial sections verified sufficient diffusion of the infectious agents deep into the tissues. Infection was confirmed by Ziel Neelsen-staining and PCR to detect mycobacterial DNA. We observed the infection of different cell types, including macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and pneumocytes-II, which were critically dependent on the mycobacterial species used. Furthermore, different forms of nuclear alterations (karyopyknosis, karyorrhexis, karyolysis) resulting in cell death were detected in the infected cells, again with characteristic species-dependent differences. CONCLUSION: We show the application of a human ex vivo tissue culture model for mycobacterial infections. The immediate primary infection of a set of different cell types and the characteristic morphologic changes observed in these infected human tissues significantly adds to the current understanding of the initial phase of human pulmonary tuberculosis. Further studies are ongoing to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the early onset of mycobacterial infections in the human lung."

OBJECTIVE: We wanted to evaluate the usefulness of clinical findings, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), interferon-gamma-releasing assay (IGRA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of sputum in the diagnosis of smear-negative PTB. METHODS: From June 2006 to September 2008, 178 patients with suspected PTB on the basis of clinical and radiological findings visited our institute. After excluding smear-positive cases (n = 77) and cases with an inconclusive diagnosis (n = 17), we studied 84 patients. Their clinical records, HRCT, sputum TB-PCR assay and IGRA results were retrospectively evaluated. A QuantiFeron-TB Gold (QFT-G; Cellestis Ltd., Carnegie, Vic., Australia) assay was used for the IGRA. RESULTS: Active PTB was diagnosed in 40 (48%) of 84 patients; lack of sputum and young age were significantly associated with an increased risk of PTB. The sensitivities of sputum PCR assay, IGRA, and HRCT were 43.2, 84.4 and 80.0%, respectively, and the specificities were 97.7, 82.9 and 70.5%, respectively. Among the 38 patients suspected of having PTB based on HRCT, 24 patients showed positive results on the IGRA, and 23 of these were diagnosed with active PTB. Among the 35 patients suggested not to have TB based on HRCT, 25 showed negative results on the IGRA, and 23 (92%) of these were diagnosed as not to have TB. CONCLUSION: The combined results of HRCT and the IGRA could help decision-making for early initiation of treatment in smear-negative patients."

Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), a type of granulomatous disease, is accompanied by intense angiogenesis and VEGF levels have been reported to be elevated in serum or tissue inflamed by pulmonary tuberculosis. We investigated the expression of T4 in granulomatous lung tissues at various stages of active pulmonary tuberculosis, and we also examined the expression patterns of VEGF and HIF-1 to compare their T4 expression patterns in patients' tissues and in the tissue microarray of TB patients. T4 was highly expressed in both granulomas and surrounding lymphocytes in nascent granulomatous lung tissue, but was expressed only surrounding tissues of necrotic or caseous necrotic regions. The expression pattern of HIF-1 was similar to that of T4. VEGF was expressed in both granulomas and blood vessels surrounding granulomas. The expression pattern of VEGF co-localized with CD31 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule, PECAM-1), a blood endothelial cell marker, and partially co-localized with T4. However, the expression of T4 did not co-localize with alveolar macrophages. Stained alveolar macrophages were present surrounding regions of granuloma highly expressing T4. We also analyzed mRNA expression in the sputum of 10 normal and 19 pulmonary TB patients. Expression of T4 was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis than in normal controls. These data suggest that T4 is highly expressed in granulomatous lung tissue with active pulmonary TB and is associated with HIF-1- and VEGF-mediated inflammation and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the expression of T4 in the sputum of pulmonary tuberculosis patients can be used as a potential marker for diagnosis."

To address this we employed a mouse model to track the traffic of Dendritic cells (DCs) and mycobacteria from the BCG inoculation site in the skin to the DLN. Detection of BCG in the DLN was concomitant with the priming of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells at that site. We found EpCAMlow CD11bhigh migratory skin DCs to be mobilized during the transport of BCG to the DLN. Migratory skin DCs distributed to the T-cell area of the LN, co-localized with BCG and were found in close apposition to antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. Consequently, blockade of skin DC traffic into DLN dramatically reduced mycobacterial entry into DLN and muted T-cell priming. Interestingly, DC and mycobacterial entry into the DLN was dependent on IL-1R-I, MyD88, TNFR-I and IL-12p40. In addition, we found using DC adoptive transfers that the requirement for MyD88 in BCG-triggered migration was not restricted to the migrating DC itself and that hematopoietic expression of MyD88 was needed in part for full-fledged migration. Our observations thus identify a population of DCs that contribute towards the priming of CD4+ T cells to BCG infection by transporting bacilli into the DLN in an IL-1R-MyD88-dependent manner and reveal both DC-intrinsic and -extrinsic requirements for MyD88 in DC migration."

Despite its worldwide application, the IFN- assay has not been applied in Egypt. The aim of this study was to determine the appropriate cut-off value of IFN- assay to complement the skin test screening in Egypt. The relative sensitivity (Ser ) of PPD and antigen cocktail-based IFN- assays (IFN--BA and IFN--EC) was analysed retrospectively, relative to bTB confirmatory tests (culture and PCR), using single cervical tuberculin (SCT) test reactors during 2011-2013. The absolute specificity (Sp) was studied using blood samples collected from cattle from one bTB-free herd. Analysis of the bTB database-generated sheets indicates the infection rate had decreased from 2009 to 2012 and then increased in 2013. The disease is concentrated in the Egyptian Nile Delta and Valley relative to elsewhere in the country. The cut-offs for IFN--EC assay could be optimized to provide higher sensitivity, comparable to cut-offs for IFN--BA assay. Data analysis suggests (PPDbOD >0.1, PPDbOD -NILOD >0.05 and PPDbOD >PPDaOD ) and (ECOD -NILOD 0.1) cut-off strategies to get optimal IFN--BA and IFN--EC assays results respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the prevalence of bTB in cattle in Egypt and pointing out the appropriate cut-off criteria to optimize IFN- assay as a routine ancillary test for diagnosis of bTB in Egypt."

However, the constituents of the effective ""protective immunity"" against tuberculosis responsible for containing most infections remain unknown. Evaluating gene transcriptional profiles in tuberculosis clinical cohorts is one approach to understanding the spectrum of tuberculosis progression. It is clear that apoptosis plays a role in the control of tuberculosis but the utility of apoptosis-related genes as surrogate markers of protection against tuberculosis has not been well investigated. To characterize potential surrogate markers that could discriminate different phases of the clinical tuberculosis spectrum, we investigated gene expression of several TNF-alpha dependent apoptotic genes (TNFR1, TNFR2, FLICE, FLIPs) by real-time RT-PCR of peripheral blood cells from cohorts of individuals with active tuberculosis or potential exposure to tuberculosis. Newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients (n=23), their close household contacts (n=80), and community controls (n=46) were tested at intervals over a period of up to two years. Latent infection or previous Mtb contact was assessed by ELISPOT and TST and complete blood counts were performed during the follow up. Results showed significant upregulation of FLIPs expression by infected individuals regardless of clinical status at entry to the study. A higher percentage of lymphocytes was found in the infected household contacts that remained healthy. In contrast, in individuals with active TB, a significant upregulation of TNFR2 expression, a significantly higher percentage of monocytes and a significantly decreased lymphocyte count were seen, compared to subjects that remained healthy. Moreover, the household contacts who subsequently developed signs of TB also had a significantly high number of monocytes. These data suggest tuberculosis may be associated with decreased T-cell survival (perhaps due to apoptosis) while inhibition of apoptosis in monocytes could lead to a relative increase in these cells: a situation predicted to favour Mtb."

IP-10 and MCP-2 were determined in supernatants from whole blood stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens. Samples were obtained from 80 patients with culture- and/or PCR-proven tuberculosis (TB), and 124 unexposed healthy controls: 86 high school students and 38 high school staff. IP-10 and MCP-2 test cut-offs were established based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. TB patients produced significantly higher levels (median) of IP-10 (2158 pg x mL(-1)) and MCP-2 (379 pg x mL(-1)) compared with interferon (IFN)-gamma (215 pg x mL(-1)). The QFT-IT, IP-10 and MCP-2 tests detected 81, 83 and 71% of the TB patients; 0, 3 and 0% of the high school students and 0, 16 and 3% of the staff, respectively. Agreement between tests was high (>89%). By combining IP-10 and IFN-gamma tests, the detection rate increased among TB patients to 90% without a significant increase in positive responders among the students. In conclusion, interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 and monocyte chemotactic protein-2 responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens could be used to diagnose infection. Combining interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 and interferon-gamma may be a simple approach to increase the detection rate of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific in vitro tests."

The relationship between quantitative T-cell responses and mycobacterial load remains unclear. We hypothesised that, in a HIV-prevalent high burden setting, the magnitude of mycobacterial antigen-specific and non-specific T-cell IFN- responses would correlate with (a) bacterial load and (b) culture conversion in patients undergoing treatment. METHODS: We compared baseline (n=147), 2 (n=35) and 6 month (n=13) purified-protein-derivative (PPD) and RD1-specific (TSPOT.TB and QFT-GIT) blood RD1-specific (TSPOT.TB; QFT-GIT) responses with associates of sputum bacillary load in patients with culture-confirmed TB in Cape Town, South Africa. RESULTS: IFN- responses were not associated with liquid culture time-to-positivity, smear-grade, Xpert MTB/RIF-generated cycle threshold values or the presence of cavities on the chest radiograph in patients with culture-confirmed TB and irrespective of HIV-status. 2-month IGRA conversion rates (positive-to-negative) were negligible [<11% for TSPOT.TB (3/28) and QFT-GIT (1/29)] and lower compared to culture [60% (21/35); p<0.01].

The traditional view holds that inflammation in sarcoidosis is compartmentalized to involved organs. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether whole blood gene expression signatures reflect inflammatory pathways in the lung in sarcoidosis and whether these signatures overlap with tuberculosis. METHODS: We analyzed transcriptomic data from blood and lung biopsies in sarcoidosis and compared these profiles with blood transcriptomic data from tuberculosis and other diseases. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Applying machine learning algorithms to blood gene expression data, we built a classifier that distinguished sarcoidosis from health in derivation and validation cohorts (92% sensitivity, 92% specificity). The most discriminative genes were confirmed by quantitative PCR and correlated with disease severity. Transcript profiles significantly induced in blood overlapped with those in lung biopsies and identified shared dominant inflammatory pathways (e.g., Type-I/II interferons). Sarcoidosis and tuberculosis shared more overlap in blood gene expression compared with other diseases using the 86-gene signature reported to be specific for tuberculosis and the sarcoidosis signature presented herein, although reapplication of machine learning algorithms could identify genes specific for sarcoidosis. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that blood transcriptome analysis provides a noninvasive method for identifying inflammatory pathways in sarcoidosis, that these pathways may be leveraged to complement more invasive procedures for diagnosis or assessment of disease severity, and that sarcoidosis and tuberculosis share overlap in gene regulation of specific inflammatory pathways."

OBJECTIVE: To compare cytokine gene expression in colonic mucosa and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in TB with that in Crohn's disease. METHODS: Biopsies were obtained from normal and ulcerated colonic mucosa of 12 intestinal TB and 11 Crohn's disease patients, and PBMC from 15 intestinal TB and 12 Crohn's disease patients and 11 healthy volunteers. RNA was extracted, and the expression of selected cytokines, chemokines and pattern recognition receptors quantified by reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction using SYBR green. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), induced protein-10, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, IL-23 p19 and IL-12 p40, and Toll-like receptors (TLR) 1 and 2 in the ulcerated mucosa was increased in both intestinal TB and Crohn's disease. Expression of growth-related oncogene-alpha was increased in intestinal TB, while expression of interferon-gamma (IFN-) and TLR 4, 5 and 9 was increased in Crohn's disease. Expression of RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) was decreased in Crohn's disease. Secretion of IFN- or IL-10 from PBMC was not significantly altered in either disease. PBMC mRNA expression of IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA was upregulated in Crohn's disease, while that of IL-17 was upregulated in intestinal TB.

However, the mechanism of PD-1/PD-Ls pathway involved in negative regulation of anti-TB immunity has been still unclear. Recently, the study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection demonstrated that PD-1 could induce the expression of basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (BATF) to inhibit CD8(+) T cell function. While the mechanism of immune regulation of BATF in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) infection has not yet been elucidated. Methods: We enrolled 104 participants including ATB patients (n = 66), latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) (n = 16) and healthy control (HC) (n = 22). The expressions of BATF in peripheral blood CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells from enrolled subjects were determined using flow cytometry. Intervention with PD-1/PD-Ls pathway was performed by using blocking antibodies or human PD-L1 fusion protein. Silencing BATF in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by electroporation with siRNA. Real-time quantitative PCR, CFSE dilution assay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were employed to test T cell functions after BATF knockdown. Results: The percentages of BATF(+)CD4(+) (P = 0.0003 and P < 0.0001, respectively) and BATF(+)CD8(+) (P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0003, respectively) cells were significantly increased in ATB patients compared with LTBI and HC. BATF-expressing PD-1(+) T cells in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were much higher in ATB group than those in LTBI group (P = 0.0426 and 0.0104, respectively) and HC group (P = 0.0133 and 0.0340, respectively). There was a positive correlation between BATF expression and PD-1 expression in ATB patients (for CD4(+) T cells, r = 0.6761, P = 0.0158; for CD8(+) T cells, r = 0.6104, P = 0.0350). BATF knockdown could enhance IL-2 and IFN- secretions (P = 0.0485 and 0.0473, respectively) and CD4(+) T cells proliferation (P = 0.0041) in vitro. Conclusions: In the context of tuberculosis, BATF mediates negative regulation of PD-1/PD-Ls pathway on T cell functions. BATF knockdown can improve cytokine secretion and cells proliferation in vitro."

METHODS: We prospectively investigated severely malnourished young children (<5 years) with radiological pneumonia admitted over a 15-month period. Investigations included blood culture, sputa for microscopy and mycobacterial culture. Xpert MTB/RIF assay was introduced during the study. Study children were followed for 12 weeks following their discharge from the hospital. RESULTS: 405 eligible children were enrolled, with a median age of 10 months. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from blood culture in 18 (4.4%) children, of which 72% were Gram negatives. Tuberculosis was confirmed microbiologically in 7% (27/396) of children that provided sputum - 10 by culture, 21 by Xpert MTB/RIF assay, and 4 by both tests. The diagnostic yield from induced sputum was 6% compared to 3.5% from gastric aspirate. Sixty (16%) additional children had tuberculosis diagnosed clinically that was not microbiologically confirmed. Most confirmed tuberculosis cases did not have a positive contact history or positive tuberculin test. The sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF assay compared to culture was 67% (95% CI: 24-94) and 92% (95% CI: 87-95) respectively. Overall case-fatality rate was 17% and half of the deaths occurred in home following discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: TB was common in severely malnourished Bangladeshi children with pneumonia. X-pert MTB/RIF assay provided higher case detection rate compared to sputum microscopy and culture. The high mortality among the study children underscores the need for further research aimed at improved case detection and management for better outcomes."

We found that Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection induced marked upregulation of IDO-1 expression in both human and murine macrophages in vitro and in the lungs of mice following aerosol challenge with M. tuberculosis. The absence of IDO-1 in dendritic cells enhanced the activation of mycobacteria-specific T cells in vitro. Interestingly, IDO-1-deficiency during M. tuberculosis infection in mice was not associated with altered mycobacteria-specific T cell responses in vivo. The bacterial burden of infected organs, pulmonary inflammatory responses, and survival were also comparable in M. tuberculosis-infected IDO-1 deficient and wild type animals. Tryptophan is metabolised into either picolinic acid or quinolinic acid, but only picolinic acid inhibited the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro. By contrast macrophages infected with pathogenic mycobacteria, produced quinolinic, rather than picolinic acid, which did not reduce M. tuberculosis growth in vitro. Therefore, although M. tuberculosis induces robust expression of IDO-1 and activation of tryptophan metabolism, IDO-1-deficiency fails to impact on the immune control and the outcome of the infection in the mouse model of tuberculosis."

Fifteen childhood patients with tuberculosis and 15 healthy children were recruited. Sputa samples and venous blood were collected, and according to different procedures, IGRA, sputum smear, colloidal gold assay (CGA), fluorescence quantitation polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR), and tuberculosis skin test (TST) were, respectively, performed. Thirty healthy children vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) were also recruited, and the comparative test was carried out between IGRA and TST. In all of 15 childhood patients with TB, the positive rates were 86.7%, 20.0%, 26.7%, 40%, and 66.7% in IGRA, sputum smear, CGA, FQ-PCR, and TST, respectively. In the children vaccinated with BCG, the positive rate of IGRA was significantly lower than that of TST (6.7% vs 76.7%). From high to low, the specificities of the five methods were sputum smear (100%), IGRA (86.7%), FQ-PCR (86.7%), TST (40%), and CGA (26.7%). Although the specificities of sputum smear and FQ-PCR were more than or equal to that of IGRA, the relative sensitivities limited their applications in populations of children. IGRA is a sensitive and specific method, and could be taken as a first choice for detecting MTB infection in populations of children."

A putative explanation is the simultaneous presence of a subversive Th2 response. However, interpretation is confounded by interleukin 4delta2 (IL-4delta2), a splice variant and inhibitor of IL-4. OBJECTIVE: To study levels of mRNA encoding IL-4 and IL-4delta2, and their relationship to treatment and clinical parameters, in cells from lung lavage and blood from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. METHODS: IL-4delta2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and soluble CD30 (sCD30) levels were measured by polymerase chain reaction and relevant immunoassays in 29 patients and matched control subjects lacking responses to tuberculosis-specific antigens. RESULTS: mRNA levels for IL-4 and IL-4delta2 were elevated in unstimulated cells from blood and lung lavage of patients versus control subjects (p < 0.005). In control subjects, there were low basal levels of IL-4 and IL-4delta2 mRNA expressed mainly by non-T cells (p < 0.05). However, in patients, there were greater levels of mRNA for both cytokines in both T- and non-T-cell populations (p < 0.05 compared with control subjects). Radiologic disease correlated with the IL-4/IFN-gamma ratio and sCD30 (p < 0.005). After chemotherapy, IL-4 mRNA levels remained unchanged, whereas IL-4delta2 increased in parallel with IFN-gamma (p < 0.05). Sonicates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis upregulated expression of IL-4 relative to IL-4delta2 in mononuclear cell cultures from patients (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A Th2-like response, prominent in T cells and driven by tuberculosis antigen, is present in tuberculosis and modulated by treatment, suggesting a role for IL-4 and IL-4delta2 in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis and their ratio as a possible marker of disease activity. The specific antigens inducing the IL-4 response require identification to facilitate future vaccine development strategies."

Circulating miRNAs have been repeatedly and stably detected in blood and hold promise to serve as molecular markers for diverse physiological and pathological conditions. To date, the relationship between circulating miRNAs and active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) has not been reported. Using microarray-based expression profiling followed by real-time quantitative PCR validation, the levels of circulating miRNAs were compared between patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and matched healthy controls. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic effect of selected miRNA. Bioinformatic analysis was used to explore the potential roles of these circulating miRNAs in active pulmonary tuberculosis infection. Among 92 miRNAs significantly detected, 59 miRNAs were downregulated and 33 miRNAs were upregulated in the TB serum compared to their levels in the control serum. Interestingly, only two differentially expressed miRNAs were increased not only in the serum but also in the sputum of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared to the levels for the healthy controls. Upregulated miR-29a could discriminate TB patients from healthy controls with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. A number of significantly enriched pathways regulated by these circulating miRNAs were predicted, and most of them were involved in acute-phase response, inflammatory response, and the regulation of the cytoskeleton. In all, for the first time our results revealed that a number of miRNAs were differentially expressed during active pulmonary tuberculosis infection, and circulating miR-29a has great potential to serve as a marker for the detection of active pulmonary tuberculosis infection."

However, it is not known whether the quantity of LAM present in urine provides additional prognostic information. METHODS/FINDINGS: Consecutively recruited adult outpatients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africa were investigated for TB regardless of clinical symptoms using sputum smear microscopy and liquid culture (reference standard). Urine samples were tested using the Clearview TB-ELISA for LAM and the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. The ELISA optical densities (OD) were used as a quantitative assessment of urine LAM. Among 514 patients with complete sputum and urine LAM OD results, culture-confirmed TB was diagnosed in 84 patients. Twenty-three (27.3%) were LAM-positive with a median LAM OD of 0.68 (IQR 0.16-2.43; range, 0.10-3.29) and 61 (72.6%) were LAM negative (LAM OD <0.1 above background). Higher LAM ODs were associated with a range of prognostic indices, including lower CD4 cell counts, lower haemoglobin levels, higher blood neutrophil counts and higher mycobacterial load as assessed using both sputum and urine samples. The median LAM OD among patients who died was more than 6.8-fold higher than that of patients who remained alive at 3 months (P<0.001). The small number of deaths, however, precluded adequate assessment of mortality risk stratified according to urine LAM OD. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HIV-associated TB, concentrations of LAM in urine were strongly associated with a range of poor prognostic characteristics known to be associated with mortality risk. Urine LAM assays with a semi-quantitative (negative vs. low-positive vs. high-positive) read-out may have improved clinical utility over assays with a simple binary result."

As such, new tools for laboratory diagnosis are urgently needed to improve the case detection rate, especially in regions with a high prevalence of TB and HIV. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of two in house PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction): PCR dot-blot methodology (PCR dot-blot) and PCR agarose gel electrophoresis (PCR-AG) for the diagnosis of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) in HIV seropositive and HIV seronegative patients. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted (from May 2003 to May 2004) in a TB/HIV reference hospital. Sputum specimens from 277 PTB suspects were tested by Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear, Culture and in house PCR assays (PCR dot-blot and PCR-AG) and their performances evaluated. Positive cultures combined with the definition of clinical pulmonary TB were employed as the gold standard. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of PTB was 46% (128/277); in HIV+, prevalence was 54.0% (40/74). The sensitivity and specificity of PCR dot-blot were 74% (CI 95%; 66.1%-81.2%) and 85% (CI 95%; 78.8%-90.3%); and of PCR-AG were 43% (CI 95%; 34.5%-51.6%) and 76% (CI 95%; 69.2%-82.8%), respectively. For HIV seropositive and HIV seronegative samples, sensitivities of PCR dot-blot (72% vs 75%; p=0.46) and PCR-AG (42% vs 43%; p=0.54) were similar. Among HIV seronegative patients and PTB suspects, ROC analysis presented the following values for the AFB smear (0.837), Culture (0.926), PCR dot-blot (0.801) and PCR-AG (0.599). In HIV seropositive patients, these area values were (0.713), (0.900), (0.789) and (0.595), respectively. CONCLUSION: Results of this study demonstrate that the in house PCR dot blot may be an improvement for ruling out PTB diagnosis in PTB suspects assisted at hospitals with a high prevalence of TB/HIV."

Activation of host immune responses for containment of mycobacterial infections involves participation of innate immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are sentinels of the immune system and are important for eliciting both primary and secondary immune responses to pathogens. In this context, to understand the molecular pathogenesis of tuberculosis and host response to mycobacteria and to conceive prospective vaccine candidates, it is important to understand how cell wall Ags of M. tuberculosis and, in particular, the proline-glutamic acid_polymorphic guanine-cytosine-rich sequence (PE_PGRS) family of proteins modulate DC maturation and function. In this study, we demonstrate that two cell wall-associated/secretory PE_PGRS proteins, PE_PGRS 17 (Rv0978c) and PE_PGRS 11 (Rv0754), recognize TLR2, induce maturation and activation of human DCs, and enhance the ability of DCs to stimulate CD4(+) T cells. We further found that PE_PGRS protein-mediated activation of DCs involves participation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Priming of human DCs with IFN-gamma further augmented PE_PGRS 17 or PE_PGRS 11 Ag-induced DC maturation and secretion of key proinflammatory cytokines. Our results suggest that by activating DCs, PE_PGRS proteins, important mycobacterial cell wall Ags, could potentially contribute in the initiation of innate immune responses during tuberculosis infection and hence regulate the clinical course of tuberculosis."

M. tuberculosis DNA was detected with the PCR technique in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 9 of 11 (82%) HIV-infected patients and in 7 of 21 (33%) HIV-negative patients (P < 0.01), while M. tuberculosis blood cultures were positive in 1 of 8 (12.5%) and 1 of 18 (5.5%) patients, respectively. PCR was positive in all cases with disseminated disease in both HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients and also in the HIV-positive patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Seven samples from patients with documented illness other than tuberculosis and 12 specimens from healthy volunteers, including seven volunteers with a recent positive purified protein derivative test, were used as controls and had a negative PCR. These results suggest that detection of M. tuberculosis DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may be a useful tool for rapid diagnosis of disseminated and extrapulmonary forms of tuberculosis, especially in an HIV-positive population."

However, the relative contribution of various MHC Ib-restricted T cell populations to anti-mycobacterial immunity remains elusive. In this study, we used mice that lack MHC Ia (Kb-/-Db-/-), MHC Ia/H2-M3 (Kb-/-Db-/-M3-/-), or 2m (2m-/-) to study the role of M3-restricted and other MHC Ib-restricted T cells in immunity against Mtb. Unlike their dominant role in Listeria infection, we found that M3-restricted CD8+ T cells only represented a small proportion of the CD8+ T cells responding to Mtb infection. Non-M3, MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells expanded preferentially in the lungs of Mtb-infected Kb-/-Db-/-M3-/- mice, exhibited polyfunctional capacities and conferred protection against Mtb. These MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells recognized several Mtb-derived protein antigens at a higher frequency than MHC Ia-restricted CD8+ T cells. The presentation of Mtb antigens to MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells was mostly 2m-dependent but TAP-independent. Interestingly, a large proportion of Mtb-specific MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells in Kb-/-Db-/-M3-/- mice were Qa-2-restricted while no considerable numbers of MR1 or CD1-restricted Mtb-specific CD8+ T cells were detected. Our findings indicate that nonclassical CD8+ T cells other than the known M3, CD1, and MR1-restricted CD8+ T cells contribute to host immune responses against Mtb infection. Targeting these MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells would facilitate the design of better Mtb vaccines with broader coverage across MHC haplotypes due to the limited polymorphism of MHC class Ib molecules."

Strikingly, deficient TNF expression in T-cells resulted in early control but susceptibility and eventual mortality during chronic infection with increased pulmonary pathology. TNF inactivation in both myeloid and T-cells rendered mice critically susceptible to infection with a phenotype resembling complete TNF deficient mice, indicating that myeloid and T-cells are the primary TNF sources collaborating for host control of tuberculosis. Thus, while TNF from myeloid cells mediates early immune function, T-cell derived TNF is essential to sustain protection during chronic tuberculosis infection."

This study investigated expression patterns of the co-stimulation molecule NKG2D in human tuberculosis and treatment to determine its potential usefulness as a host biomarker of tuberculosis drug efficacy. METHODS: Tuberculosis patients (n=26) were recruited in Lahore, Pakistan, at diagnosis and followed up during treatment. Household contacts (n=24) were also recruited. NKG2D expression was measured by qRT-PCR in RNA samples both ex vivo and following overnight mycobacterial stimulation in vitro. Protein expression of NKG2D and granzyme B was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: NKG2D expression in newly diagnosed tuberculosis patients was similar to household contacts in ex vivo RNA, but was higher following in vitro stimulation. The NKG2D expression was dramatically reduced by intensive phase chemotherapy, in both ex vivo blood RNA and CD8(+) T cell protein expression, but then reverted to higher levels after the continuation phase in successfully treated patients. CONCLUSION: The changes in NKG2D expression through successful treatment reflect modulation of the peripheral cytotoxic T cell response. This likely reflects firstly in vivo stimulation by live Mycobacterium tuberculosis, followed by the response to dead bacilli, antigen-release and finally immunopathology resolution. Such changes in host peripheral gene expression, alongside clinical and microbiological indices, could be developed into a biosignature of tuberculosis drug-induced cure to be used in future clinical trials."

The immunopathogenesis of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and tuberculosis remains incompletely understood. We hypothesized that a deficiency of IL-10 and its homologs may contribute to the immunopathology of IRIS in these patients. METHODS: We performed a case-control analysis involving patients with HIV infection and tuberculosis who had IRIS at clinical presentation (tuberculosis-IRIS) and similar patients with HIV infection and tuberculosis who did not develop tuberculosis-IRIS (non-IRIS). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured in the presence or absence of heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 6 and 24 hours. Messenger RNA was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Cytokine concentrations in serum were also determined. RESULTS: Cultures of PBMCs stimulated with M. tuberculosis for 24 hours yielded higher IL-10 and interleukin 22 (IL-22) transcript levels for tuberculosis-IRIS patients, compared with non-IRIS patients. Analysis of corresponding serum samples showed significantly higher concentrations of IL-10 and IL-22 in tuberculosis-IRIS patients, compared with non-IRIS patients. CONCLUSIONS: IL-10 and IL-22 were differentially induced in PBMCs from tuberculosis-IRIS patients after in vitro stimulation, and higher concentrations of their corresponding proteins were detected in serum (in vivo). The higher levels of IL-10 observed in this study may represent a compensatory antiinflammatory response during tuberculosis-IRIS. The elevated levels of IL-22 suggest an association between this cytokine and immunopathology during tuberculosis-IRIS."

BACKGROUND: Recently, important advances regarding the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis have been introduced, which influence the decision to initiate anti-tuberculosis treatment. METHODS: To evaluate the impact of different methods for the presumed diagnosis of tuberculosis, individuals with suspected tuberculosis were prospectively enrolled following a specific algorithm including initial smear microscopy and Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) from sputum. In cases of negative initial test results, tuberculin skin testing, bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies and interferon- release assays (IGRAs) in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were performed. RESULTS: Amongst 135 individuals with suspected tuberculosis, 42 had tuberculosis, 10 had nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary infection/colonization (one had both tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria pulmonary infection/colonization) and 84 had an alternative final diagnosis. The sensitivity and specificity were 41% and 99% [positive likelihood ratio (LR+) = 40] for sputum microscopy and 31% and 98% (LR+) = 16) for BAL nucleic acid amplification, respectively. In patients with acid-fast bacilli smear-negative tuberculosis (25/42, 59.5%), M. tuberculosis-specific BAL fluid IGRA was 92% sensitive and 87% specific (LR+) = 7) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: None of the microbiological or immunological methods that aim to provide a rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis whilst waiting the confirmation of the M. tuberculosis culture results is on its own accurate enough to diagnose or exclude pulmonary tuberculosis. Negative sputum microscopy and M. tuberculosis-specific NAAT results should prompt bronchoscopy including BAL for M. tuberculosis-specific IGRA in individuals with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis."

The objective of this study was to profile a panel of serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of pulmonary TB infection. METHODS: Using TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA) analysis followed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validation, expression levels of miRNAs in serum samples from 30 patients with active tuberculosis and 60 patients with Bordetella pertussis (BP), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and enterovirus (EV) were analyzed. RESULTS: The Low-Density Array data showed that 97 miRNAs were differentially expressed in pulmonary TB patient sera compared with healthy controls (90 up-regulated and 7 down-regulated). Following qRT-PCR confirmation and receiver operational curve (ROC) analysis, three miRNAs (miR-361-5p, miR-889 and miR-576-3p) were shown to distinguish TB infected patients from healthy controls and other microbial infections with moderate sensitivity and specificity (area under curve (AUC) value range, 0.711-0.848). Multiple logistic regression analysis of a combination of these three miRNAs showed an enhanced ability to discriminate between these two groups with an AUC value of 0.863. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that altered levels of serum miRNAs have great potential to serve as non-invasive biomarkers for early detection of pulmonary TB infection."

On physical examination, the dog appeared quiet, responsive, and apyretic, with generalized and severe lymphadenomegaly. Hematologic abnormalities included neutrophilic leukocytosis with left shift, and lymphopenia. Blood smears revealed intracytoplasmic bacilli negatively stained with May-Grnwald-Giemsa in neutrophils and monocytes. Lymph node smears revealed pyogranulomatous adenitis with calcified deposits and many negative-staining rod structures, both within the cytoplasm of neutrophils and macrophages, and free in the background. An acid-fast stain (Ziehl-Neelsen) confirmed the diagnosis of mycobacterial infection. The dog was euthanized for public health and ethical reasons, and the postmortem examination revealed severe and generalized granulomatous and necrotizing lymphadenitis, panniculitis, and hepatitis, and infiltration of epithelioid macrophages in the lungs, colon, and spleen. Numerous acid-fast bacilli, consistent with mycobacterial infection, were observed both in the cytoplasm of epithelioid macrophages and giant cells, and free in the background. Mycobacterium bovis was first confirmed by conventional PCR of organ extracts. Mycobacterium avium was detected in a culture of the same organs. Further PCR amplifications and sequencing revealed a coinfection with 2 different species of mycobacterium, one belonging to the Mycobacterium avium complex and the other to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex."

Three calves from a bovine tuberculosis-free herd, scored avian reactors in the gamma-interferon assay for bovine tuberculosis, were sedated and inoculated endotracheally with a virulent Mycobacterium bovis strain. Then, three other avian reactors were housed with the above donor calves. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from the nasal swabs of the three endotracheally infected, donor calves. On these samples, TB complex-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for IS6110 were also positive, albeit with a different time kinetics. The three contact-infected calves showed clear immunological signs of infection; however, their nasal swabs were always PCR-negative and only Mycobacterium avium was isolated. In the endotracheally infected donor calves there was a rise of the gamma-interferon responses to avian and bovine purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculins, which reached the same stable plateau levels over the whole experiment. The above effect was also observed in the contact-infected calves, even though the response to avian PPD tuberculin always remained at a higher level. By using conventional bovine and avian PPD tuberculins, the comparative intradermal test was generally positive in endotracheally infected, as opposed to contact-infected calves; a positive intradermal test for M. bovis was obtained in two contact-infected calves by different bovine PPD tuberculins based on M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) secreted or somatic antigens. It was concluded that M. bovis infection may be concealed for some time in cattle sensitized by mycobacteria of the avium/intracellulare group and that different diagnostic procedures should be adopted for such animals."

Among the major challenges in the control of TB is the implementation of sensitive methods for detection of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Currently, in vitro interferon gamma release assays, yielding single value readout, are used as an alternative to the traditional tuberculin skin test for the diagnosis of LTBI. More complex characterization of immune status of LTBI individuals, however, is desirable for indication of LTBI subjects for preventative chemotherapy. Here we describe a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for determination of expression levels of 14 genes, additional to interferon gamma, which was applied for comparison of the specific Mtb-antigen immune response of blood cells from healthy, latently infected, and TB individuals. With the use of principal component analysis and discriminant analysis, a pattern of mRNA levels of 6 genes was identified, allowing discrimination of healthy individuals from active TB and LTBI subjects. These results open the way to development of multimarker qPCR for the detection of LTBI."

The expression profile of miRNA under PPD challenge was first measured using microarray analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from ATB patients and healthy controls (HC). The remarkably reactive miRNAs were then validated in a larger cohort by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the diagnostic value of the determined PPD-responsive miRNAs. The potential targets for those miRNAs were also predicted by computational programs. Fourteen of 866 human miRNAs exhibited at least 1.8-fold difference in the ratio of expression level before and after stimulation with PPD between the ATB and HC groups. The qRT-PCR study validated the findings from microarray-based screening, in which miR-155 exhibited a fold change of 1.4 in the HC group and 3.7 in the ATB group upon PPD stimulation (p < 0.0001); miR-155* exhibited a fold change of 1.9 in the HC and 4.6 in the ATB group (p < 0.005). In ROC plots, the area under the curve was 0.8972 for miR-155 and 0.7945 for miR-155*. The background expression of these 2 microRNAs exhibited no differences between the ATB and HC groups. miR-155 and miR-155* exhibited characteristic expression by TB-specific antigen, suggesting that they can be potential diagnostic markers under the challenge of specific MTB antigens."

Therefore, efficacy and diagnostic potential of different secretory antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (CFP-10, Ag85complex, Ag85 A, B, C) and their combinations along with ESAT-6 in the detection of antibody profiles of childhood tuberculosis cases were evaluated using ELISA technique and reactivity was compared with the gold standards (smear, culture and IS6110 targeted PCR). In the present study, 88 fresh, untreated childhood tuberculosis (TB) cases, 17 children undergoing anti-tubercular therapy, 17 children having disease other than TB and 25 healthy children were included. ROC curve analysis was used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of each antigen for antibody detection. Ag85C was found to be showing highest sensitivity of 89.77% and specificity of 92% among all the antigens used (P < 0.0001). Positivity with antigen was 95% in smear and culture negative patients. Antibody reactivity was noted in 92.62% of patients who were positive for IS6110 by PCR. Cocktail of all the antigens showed 67.1% sensitivity and 80% of specificity.

Low reactivity of 31.82% in patients and least specificity of 24% was noted with Ag85A. Our finding demonstrates the potential of Ag85C in the detection of antibody in childhood TB cases and this antigen showed good concordance with PCR positivity."

We aimed to identify a serum miRNA signature to be used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). To account for variations due to the genetic makeup, we enrolled adults from two study settings in Europe and Africa. The following categories of subjects were considered: healthy (H), active pulmonary TB (PTB), active pulmonary TB, HIV co-infected (PTB/HIV), latent TB infection (LTBI), other pulmonary infections (OPI), and active extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB). Sera from 10 subjects of the same category were pooled and, after total RNA extraction, screened for miRNA levels by TaqMan low-density arrays. After identification of ""relevant miRNAs"", we refined the serum miRNA signature discriminating between H and PTB on individual subjects. Signatures were analyzed for their diagnostic performances using a multivariate logistic model and a Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model. A leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) approach was adopted for assessing how both models could perform in practice. The analysis on pooled specimens identified selected miRNAs as discriminatory for the categories analyzed. On individual serum samples, we showed that 15 miRNAs serve as signature for H and PTB categories with a diagnostic accuracy of 82% (CI 70.2-90.0), and 77% (CI 64.2-85.9) in a RVM and a logistic classification model, respectively. Considering the different ethnicity, by selecting the specific signature for the European group (10 miRNAs) the diagnostic accuracy increased up to 83% (CI 68.1-92.1), and 81% (65.0-90.3), respectively. The African-specific signature (12 miRNAs) increased the diagnostic accuracy up to 95% (CI 76.4-99.1), and 100% (83.9-100.0), respectively. Serum miRNA signatures represent an interesting source of biomarkers for TB disease with the potential to discriminate between PTB and LTBI, but also among the other categories."

METHODS: Level of membrane CD14 (mCD14) and membrane TLR4 (mTLR4) were determined by flow cytometry, in 104 patients with pulmonary TB (before and after treatment), 67 household contacts, and 114 healthy control subjects. Genotype/allele frequencies in CD14 -159 and TLR4 Asp299Gly were obtained by polymerase chain reaction-restriction-fragment length polymorphism. Levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14) in sera were quantified by ELISA. RESULTS: Higher levels of mCD14/sCD14 and mTLR4 were observed in the patients and the household contacts than in the control subjects (P<.05) and decreased in the patients after the infection was resolved. The frequency of the CD14 -159TT genotype was higher in the patients than in the control subjects (35.6% vs. 12.3%, respectively). Patients who were homozygous for allele T of the CD14 promoter gene had a significantly higher risk for development of pulmonary TB, with an odds ratio of 2.267 (95% confidence interval, 1.5%-3.3%).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of M. tuberculosis on autophagy in human primary macrophages and the role of specific T cells in this process. METHODS: M. tuberculosis (H37Rv)-infected macrophages were incubated with naive or M. tuberculosis-specific T cells. Autophagy was evaluated at 4 hours and 8 hours after infection by analyzing the levels of LC3-II (a hallmark of autophagy) and p62 (a protein degraded by autophagy). M. tuberculosis survival was evaluated by counting the colony-forming units. RESULTS: M. tuberculosis infection of macrophages inhibited the autophagic process at 8 hours after infection. Naive T cells could not rescue this block, whereas M. tuberculosis-specific T cells restored autophagy degradation, accompanied by enhanced bacterial killing. Notably, the effect of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells was not affected by neutralization of endogenous IFN- and tumor necrosis factor  and was blocked by preventing contact between macrophages and T cells, suggesting that cell-cell interaction is crucial. CONCLUSIONS: M. tuberculosis inhibits autophagy in human primary macrophages, and specific T cells can restore functional autophagic flux through cell-cell contact."

Compared to Interferon- release assays (IGRA), IP-10 is released in high levels enabling novel approaches such as field friendly dried blood spots (DBS) and molecular detection. AIM: To develop a robust IP-10 based molecular assay for the diagnosis of infection with M. tubercuolsis from whole blood and DBS. METHOD: We developed a one-step probe based multiplex RT-qPCR assay for detecting IP-10 and IFN- mRNA expression from whole blood and DBS samples. The assay was validated and applied for the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection in DBS samples from 43 patients with confirmed TB, 13 patients with latent TB and 96 presumed uninfected controls. In parallel, IP-10 and INF- levels were measured in Quantiferon (QFT-TB) plasma supernatants. RESULTS: IP-10 mRNA upregulation was detectable at 4 hours after stimulation (6 fold upregulation) peaking at 8 hours (108 fold upregulation). IFN- expression occurred in concert but levels were lower (peak 6.7 fold upregulation). IP-10 gene expression level was significantly higher in patients with tuberculosis (median 31.2, IQR 10.7-67.0) and persons with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) (41.2, IQR 9.8-64.9) compared to healthy controls (1.6, IQR 1.1-2.4; p<0.0001). The IP-10 mRNA and protein based tests had comparable diagnostic accuracy to QFT-TB, sensitivity (85% and 88% vs 85%) and specificity (96% and 96% vs 97%, p = ns.). CONCLUSION: We developed a rapid, robust and accurate molecular immunodiagnostic test for M. tuberculosis infection. By combining DBS based sample acquisition, mail or currier based sample transport with centralized molecular detection, this immunodiagnostic test concept can reduce the local technological requirements everywhere and make it possible to offer highly accurate immunodiagnostic tests in low resource settings."

We therefore created a clinical algorithm for differentiating TBP from other diagnoses using peripheral blood and peritoneal fluid mononuclear cells (PBMC/PF-MC) along with conventional tests. METHODS: All adult patients with suspected TBP in whom enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays were performed both on PBMC and PF-MC were prospectively enrolled over a 6-year period. Confirmed TBP with positive cultures or Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR, probable TBP with PF changes consistent with TBP, caseating granuloma, and a successful response to anti-TB therapy, as well as possible TBP without exclusion of TBP, were each defined. RESULTS: A total of 74 patients were enrolled. Of these, 45 (61%) (19 confirmed, 16 probable, and 10 possible) were classified as TBP. The other 29 (39%) patients were classified as not TB. The sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of the tested methods for diagnosing TBP were as follows: PBMC ELISPOT (6 spots), 84% and 59%; PF-MC ELISPOT (6 spots), 87% and 86%; PF-MC/PBMC ratio (3), 69% and 97%; and PF-ADA level (21 U/L), 82% and 79%. The areas under the ROC curves were as follows: PF-MC ELISPOT, 0.90; PF-MC/PBMC ratio, 0.82; PBMC ELISPOT, 0.80; and PF-ADA, 0.80, respectively. When a 2-step algorithm ('PBMC ELISPOT 6 spots or PF-ADA 21 U/L' as a rule-out test and 'PF-MC/PBMC ratio 3' as a rule-in test) was applied, 67% (30/45) of the patients with TBP were accurately classified without undergoing invasive procedures. CONCLUSIONS: A 2-step algorithm using the PBMC/PF-MC ELISPOT assays and PF-ADA appears to be a promising rapid and non-invasive approach for diagnosing TBP."

We used an enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) to detect anti-Mycobacterium bovis BCG antibody-secreting cells in CSF and PBL, PCR to detect a repeated insertion sequence (IS6110) specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in CSF, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect anti-BCG antibodies in CSF and PBL. In the meantime, culture of CSF from every TBM and control patient was done on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. ELISPOT proved to be the most valuable test, with a sensitivity of 84.0% and a specificity of 91.8%, and showed a sensitivity of 100.0% with the CSF specimens obtained within 4 weeks after the onset of TBM. The numbers of CSF anti-BCG immunoglobulin-secreting cells tested by ELISPOT were even higher in the early phase of TBM and declined while the disease was going on (P = 0.008), which allowed an early diagnosis to be made. The sensitivities of PCR and ELISA were only 75.0% and 52.3%, respectively; and the specificities were 93.7% and 91.6%, respectively.

Detection of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis using conventional culture- and biochemical-based assays is time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, a simple and sensitive method for rapid detection has been anxiously awaited. In the present study, a visual loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was designed from the rimM (encoding 16S rRNA-processing protein) gene sequence and used to rapidly detect M. tuberculosis and M. bovis from clinical samples in South China. The visual LAMP reaction was performed by adding calcein and manganous ion, allowing the results to be read by simple visual observation of color change in a closed-tube system, and which takes less than 1 h at 65 degrees C. The assay correctly identified 84 M. tuberculosis isolates, 3 M. bovis strains and 1 M. bovis BCG samples, but did not detect 51 non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) isolates and 8 other bacterial species. Sensitivity of this assay for detection of genomic DNA was 1 pg. Specific amplification was confirmed by the ladder-like pattern of gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme HhaI digestion. The assay successfully detected M. tuberculosis and M. bovis not only in pure bacterial culture but also in clinical samples of sputum, pleural fluid and blood. The speed, specificity, sensitivity of the rimM LAMP, the lack of a need for expensive equipment, and the visual readout show great potential for clinical detection of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis."

Because ESAT-6 has a low inherent immunogenicity, we used Hepatitis B virus core (HBc) protein as an immune carrier to enhance ESAT-6 immunogenicity. The ESAT-6 gene was inserted into the major immunodominant region of the HBc molecule by fusion PCR. The recombinant protein, HBc-ESAT-6 (HE6), was expressed in Escherichia coli, and electron microscopy confirmed the formation of virus-like particles. The immunogenicity of the chimeric particles was assessed in mice. Serological assays and in vitro Th1-biased cytokine assays found that immunization with HE6 particles elicited significantly higher ESAT-6-specific antibodies and CD4/CD8 T cell responses in mice compared to immunization with recombinant ESAT-6 protein. These data demonstrate the feasibility of HBc particles serving as an efficient immune carrier for ESAT-6 and suggest that HE6 has potential for use in a tuberculosis subunit vaccine."

Their role in tuberculosis (TB) is unknown. We classified 1272 healthy TB contacts according to their tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon (IFN)-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) results and 128 TB cases, and studied the expression of FOXP3 and interleukin (IL)-10 in blood samples. Compared to the uninfected contact group (TST(-), ELISPOT(-)), we observed higher levels of FOXP3 mRNA in blood from TB patients (< 0.001), but IL-10 expression was slightly lower (P = 0.04). In contrast, FOXP3 expression levels were significantly lower (P = 0.001) in the recently infected contacts (TST(+), ELISPOT(+)) but there was no difference for IL-10 (P = 0.74). We hypothesize that during early/subclinical TB, most of which will become latent, FOXP3(+) T(regs) may be sequestered in the lungs, but when TB becomes progressive, FOXP3 reappears at increased levels in the periphery. While these findings do not reveal the role, beneficial or harmful, of T(regs) in TB, they emphasize the probable importance of these cells."

This may lead to early discharge of TB patients, resulting in an increased risk of disease transmission and drug resistance. Plasma lncRNAs might act as potential biomarkers to evaluate TB cure in an efficient and precise manner. METHODS: A lncRNA microarray assay was used to screen differentially expressed plasma lncRNAs in untreated TB and cured TB subjects. The expression levels of lncRNAs were verified by qPCR. Target genes of lncRNAs were predicted using a coding-non-coding gene co-expression network and mRNA-lncRNA-miRNA interaction network analysis. RESULTS: The expression levels of lncRNAs uc.48+ (p < 0.001) and NR_105053 (p = 0.03) were found to differ significantly between the untreated TB group and the cured TB group. The predicted target genes of uc.48+ were EP300, BAI1 and NR_105053 were TLR9, MYD88, BAI1, respectively. A predictive model for cured TB was established by the combination of uc.48+ and NR_105053 expression, with a sensitivity of 90.00% and specificity of 86.36%, and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.945. CONCLUSIONS: lncRNAs uc.48+ and NR_105053 may serve as potential biomarkers to distinguish between untreated TB patients and cured TB subjects. This study provides an experimental basis to evaluate the effect of TB treatment and may also provide new clues to the pathological mechanisms of TB."

Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Model performance was tested in a validation cohort of 36 children from the UK.

Even though mycobacteria are cleared, mycobacterial antigens may persist in infected tissues, causing sustained inflammation and chronicity of the disease. The aim of this study was to explore various mycobacterial antigens in pleural effusions, the impact of HIV infection and CD4+ T-cell depletion on the presence of antigens, and the diagnostic potential of antigens for improved and rapid diagnosis of pleural TB. METHODS: Pleural fluid specimens were collected from patients presenting with clinically suspected pleural TB, and processed routinely for culture, cytology, and adenosine deaminase activity analysis. HIV status and CD4+ T-cell counts were recorded. Pleural fluid mononuclear cells (PFMC) were isolated, and cell smears were stained with acid-fast staining and immunocytochemistry for various mycobacterial antigens. Real-time and nested-PCR were performed. Patients were categorized as pleural TB or non-TB cases using a composite reference standard. Performance of the mycobacterial antigens as diagnostic test was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 41 patients were enrolled, of which 32 were classified as pleural TB and 9 as non-TB. Thirteen patients had culture confirmed pleural TB, 26 (81%) were HIV-TB co-infected, and 64% had <100 CD4+ T-cells/microL. Both secreted and cell-wall mycobacterial antigens were detected in PFMC. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM) was the most frequently detected antigen. There was no direct correlation between positive culture and antigens. Cases with low CD4+ T-cell counts had higher bacterial and antigen burden. By combining detection of secreted antigen or LAM, the sensitivity and specificity to diagnose pleural TB was 56 and 78%, respectively, as compared to 41 and 100% for culture, 53 and 89% for nested PCR, and 6 and 100% for real-time PCR. CONCLUSION: Mycobacterial antigens were detectable in PFMC from tuberculous pleural effusions, even in cases where viable mycobacteria or bacterial DNA were not always detected. Thus, a combination of secreted antigen and LAM detection by immunocytochemistry may be a complement to acid-fast staining and contribute to rapid and accurate diagnosis of pleural TB."

This study was to understand the yield of BC using different testing strategies and patient-level factors associated with BC among pulmonary TB patients in Tianjin, China during 2017-2018. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted, enrolling pulmonary TB patients reported to National TB Information Management System (TBIMS) in Tianjin during 2017-2018. BC was defined as a positive result by any of the followings: smear microscopy, culture, or nucleic acid amplification test. Individual characteristics were compared between patients with positive and negative bacteriological results using contingency tables and (2) test. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to analyze factors associated with BC, calculating adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) (=0.05). RESULTS: Of 6364 reported patients, 4181 (65.7%) were bacteriologically confirmed. Positivity proportion was 43.1% (2746/6364) for smear microscopy, 57.7% (3380/5853) for culture, 61.7% (1608/2605) for Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) and 73.4% (1824/2484) for combination of the three. The unemployed (aOR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-2.2) and farmers (aOR=1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.8) compared with students; diagnosis by inpatient hospitals compared with TB clinics (aOR=3.4, 95% CI: 2.6-4.4); having symptoms for 2weeks (aOR=1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.8); cough (aOR=2.2, 95% CI: 1.8-2.8); blood sputum (aOR=1.5, 95% CI: 1.0-2.2); cavitation on chest X-ray (aOR=3.3, 95% CI: 2.5-4.3); bilateral lung lobes affected (aOR=1.7, 95% CI: 1.4-2.2) were factors associated with BC. CONCLUSIONS: Combination test was an effective way to improve BC among pulmonary TB patients. Being unemployed, farmers, having prolonged symptoms, and more severe in TB condition were factors associated with BC. We recommend combination of tests to improve BC for pulmonary TB patients, especially who are in early stage of the disease or with conditions tend to be bacteriologically negative."

METHODS: One-hundred patients with culture and/or PCR confirmed M. tuberculosis infection and 168 volunteers with no risk factors for M. tuberculosis infection were tested to estimate sensitivity and specificity, respectively. RESULTS: Analysis of data from the tuberculosis (TB) patients with valid results found the sensitivity of QFT-GIT (92.6%, 87/94) to be significantly higher than that for the QFT-G test (81.4%, 79/97; p=0.023). The specificity of both QFT-GIT and QFT-G was 98.8% (CI: 95.1%-99.8%) with 2 of the 160 low risk subjects with valid results for both tests being positive. Data analysis confirmed the manufacturer's recommended test cut-off as being optimal, but identified higher sensitivity could be obtained by using a lower cut-off, with only a moderate decrease in specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The QFT-GIT test had enhanced sensitivity for detection of M. tuberculosis infection over the QFT-G test, whilst maintaining equivalent high specificity. The logistic benefits of the QFT-GIT test format, as well as its higher sensitivity, should enable enhanced TB control."

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of the cytokine genotype interferon (IFN)-gamma +874T/A on T cell in vitro assays in BCG nonresponders (negative to either in vivo or in vitro test with purified protein derivative or both). METHODS: Ninety healthy children who were without any clinical evidence of the disease, 45 with a BCG-scar and the remaining 45 without scar were assessed for in vitro T cell responses. CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts were measured by flow cytometry. r32kDaBCG (Ag85A-BCG) protein was used to stimulate T cells and IFN-gamma cytokine concentration in the cultures were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Polymorphism in IFN-gamma (+874T/A) region was detected by amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: T cell subsets were within the normal range in all subjects. Children with TT genotype showed significantly higher antigen-induced IFN-gamma (P < 0.001) as compared with those with AT/AA genotype. The highest values were observed in children with TT genotype combined with positive antigen-specific peripheral blood mononuclear cells proliferation. Seventy-five percent of the vaccinated children with TT genotype showed high amounts of stimulated IFN-gamma compared with 66% of scar negative and 16% of scar positive but with AA genotype. CONCLUSIONS: IFN-gamma (+874T/A) polymorphism seemed to be a strong and independent predictor for clinical outcome of both scar-positive and scar-negative children. These results may help in planning future vaccination strategies. The ability to mount in vitro lymphoproliferation did not distinguish the success or failure of BCG vaccination nor predict susceptibility to the disease."

The levels of IFN-gamma mRNA in blood cultures stimulated with either bovine or avian tuberculin or specific mycobacterial antigens were compared with those in a nonstimulated control blood culture as the basis for determining the tuberculosis (TB) status of live badgers. The assay was validated by testing 247 animals for which there were matching data from postmortem examination and culture of tissues. Relative changes in the levels of IFN-gamma mRNA in response to bovine tuberculin and specific antigens were found to be greater among badgers with tissues positive for TB on culture. The test was at its most accurate (87% of test results were correct) by using blood cultures containing bovine tuberculin as the antigen and when the response to avian tuberculin was taken into account by subtracting the avian tuberculin response from the bovine tuberculin response. At a specificity of 90.7%, the test was 70.6% sensitive. At the same specificity, the current serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for TB in badgers was only 53% sensitive. This work demonstrates that measurement of IFN-gamma mRNA by real-time PCR is a valid method for the detection of TB in live badgers and may provide an alternative to the current serological methods of diagnosis, the Brock test. The testing procedure can be completed within 5 h of receipt of the blood culture samples. In addition, the use of a molecular biology-based test offers the potential to fully automate the testing procedure through the use of robotics."

However, approximately 5% subsequently have a repeat disease episode, usually within 2 years of successful combination therapy. Presently, there is no way of predicting which patients will experience a relapse. METHODS: We identified 10 subjects who had previously experienced recurrent tuberculosis and carefully matched them to cured subjects who had had only 1 episode of tuberculosis, to patients with active tuberculosis, and to latently infected healthy subjects. We compared their ex vivo whole-blood gene-expression profiles by use of DNA array technology and confirmed the results by use of quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS: The 4 clinical tuberculosis groups exhibited distinct patterns of gene expression. The gene-transcript profiles of the patients with recurrent tuberculosis were more similar to those of the patients with active tuberculosis than to those of the cured or latently infected subjects. Discriminant analysis of a training data set showed that 9 genes were sufficient to classify the subjects. We confirmed that measurement of the expression of these genes by qRT-PCR can accurately discriminate between subjects in a test set of samples. CONCLUSIONS: A simple test based on gene-expression patterns may be used as a biomarker of cure while identifying patients who are at risk for relapse. This would facilitate the introduction of new tuberculosis drugs."

Recent changes in tuberculosis epidemiology in developed countries, including a large increase in incidence in children from certain ethnic minorities, have prompted interest in newer diagnostic methods. Liquid-based culture detection systems offer improved sensitivity and speed of diagnosis, although the time taken for detection of growth is still upwards of 1 week. Nucleic acid amplification techniques offer more rapid results, but perform best on smear-positive samples; sensitivities may be as low as 50% in smear-negative specimens. Although these newer techniques are widely used in some developed countries, in others, they are not perceived as offering sufficient benefit to justify their routine use. The diagnostic accuracy of mycobacteriophage and serologic methods is insufficient to justify their wide use even in developing countries. Despite recent developments, there is still no panacea for diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis."

However, TLR9 KO or TLR2 KO spleen cells displayed normal M. avium-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and gamma interferon (IFN-) responses. This finding was confirmed by determining the number of splenic CD4(+) T cells producing IFN- by flow cytometry. Furthermore, TLR2 and MyD88, but not TLR9, played a major role in interleukin-12 and TNF- production by M. avium-infected macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). We also found that major histocompatibility complex class II molecule expression on DCs is regulated by TLR2 and MyD88 signaling but not by TLR9. Finally, lack of TLR9, TLR2, or MyD88 reduced the numbers of macrophages, epithelioid cells, and lymphocytes in M. avium-induced granulomas but only MyD88 deficiency affected the number of liver granulomas.

Type-1 T cell immunity has been shown to be critical for host defence against tuberculosis infection, but the role of dendritic cell (DC) subsets in pathogenesis of mycobacterial infection remains unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined the effectiveness of dendritic cell (DC) subsets in BCG-infected mice in generating immune responses beneficial for pathogen clearance and reduction of pathological reactions in the tissues following challenge infection. Our data showed that only the adoptive transfer of the subset of CD8alpha+ DC isolated from infected mice (iCD8+ DC) generated significant protection, demonstrated by less mycobacterial growth and pathological changes in the lung and liver tissues in iCD8+ DC recipients than sham-treated control mice. The adoptive transfer of the CD8alpha(-)DC from the infected mice (iCD8(-) DC) not only failed to reduce bacterial growth, but enhanced inflammation characterized by diffuse heavy cellular infiltration. Notably, iCD8(-) DC produced significantly higher levels of IL-10 than iCD8+ DC and promoted more Th2 cytokine responses in in vitro DC-T cell co-culture and in vivo adoptive transfer experiments. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The data indicate that in vivo BCG-primed CD8+ DC is the dominant DC subset in inducing protective immunity especially for reducing pathological reactions in infected tissues. The finding has implications for the rational improvement of the prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for controlling tuberculosis infection and related diseases."

These studies surprisingly identified no gross defects in uptake or immune control of M. tuberculosis in SP-A-, SP-D-, and SP-A/-D-deficient mice. While both SP-A- and SP-D-deficient mice exhibited evidence of immunopathologic defects, the CD11b(high) CD11c(high) dendritic cell populations and the gamma interferon (IFN-)-dependent CD4(+) T cell response to M. tuberculosis were unaltered in all genotypes tested.

Utilizing decade-long TCR expertise, we previously developed a useful method to isolate clonotypic TCR sequences from Ag-specific IFN--producing T cells and to specifically measure clonotypic TCR frequencies in the T cell pool. In this study, we investigated TCR V repertoires/CDR3 usage, clonal expansion or dominance, and pulmonary trafficking or accumulation for purified protein deritative (PPD)-specific T effector cells producing IFN- during bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination and subsequent M. tuberculosis challenge of macaques. We found that while PPD-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T effector clones employed diverse TCR V repertoires, 30-33% of IFN-(+)CD4(+) T cell clones from three M. tuberculosis-infected macaques expressed TCR bearing a conserved residue leucine in CDR3. Many Ag-specific IFN-(+) CD4(+) and few CD8(+) T effector cells emerged as dominant clones during mycobacterial infections and underwent major recall expansion after pulmonary M. tuberculosis infection of BCG-vaccinated macaques. PPD-specific T cell clones readily trafficked to the airway or lung after BCG vaccination or M. tuberculosis infection, and some of them continuously accumulated in lungs during M. tuberculosis infection even after they became undetectable in the circulation. Importantly, remarkable recall expansion and pulmonary accumulation of T effector cells coincided with BCG-induced protection against tuberculosis. Thus, rapid clonal expansion and pulmonary accumulation of Ag-specific T effector cells appear to be one of the immune mechanisms underlying immunity against tuberculosis."

To better understand how BCG extends time to death after pulmonary infection with M. tuberculosis, we examined cytokine responses postvaccination and recruitment of activated T cells and cytokine response postinfection. At 10 weeks postvaccination, splenic gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) mRNA was significantly elevated compared to the levels at 5 weeks in ex vivo stimulation assays. At 15, 40, 60, and 120 days postinfection, T-cell activation (CD4+ CD62Llow and CD8+ CD62Llow) and mRNA expression of IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-10, IL-12, and eomesodermin were assessed. Our data show that at day 40, BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs had significantly increased levels of IFN-gamma mRNA expression but decreased TNF-alpha mRNA expression in their lungs compared to the levels in nonvaccinated animals. At day 120, a time when nonvaccinated guinea pigs succumbed to infection, low levels of IFN-gamma mRNA were observed even though there were increasing levels of IL-1, IL-12, and IL-10, and the numbers of activated T cells did not differ from those in BCG-vaccinated animals. BCG vaccination conferred the advantage of recruiting greater numbers of CD4+ CD62Llow T cells at day 40, although the numbers of CD8+ CD62Llow T cells were not elevated compared to the numbers in nonvaccinated animals. Our data suggest that day 40 postinfection may be a pivotal time point in determining vaccine efficacy and prolonged survival and that BCG promotes the capacity of T cells in the lungs to respond to infection."

Three different methods of extracting mycobacterial DNA from blood culture fluid were compared for use with the multiplex PCR. Mycobacterial cells were pelleted from a small aliquot of blood culture fluid by centrifugation, and the DNA was extracted from cells by heat lysis or a sodium iodide-isopropanol or a phenol-chloroform method. DNAs of different sizes were amplified from a region of the MPB70 gene of M. tuberculosis (372 bp) and from a region of the 16S rRNA gene of members of the genus Mycobacterium (1,030 bp), M. intracellulare (850 bp), or M. avium (180 bp) as a multiplex PCR in a single tube. The amplified DNA products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining in all 41 (100%) positive cultures after sodium iodide-isopropanol extraction, in 18 (44%) after heat lysis, and in 5 (12%) after phenol-chloroform extraction. Of the 41 positive cultures, 38 were identified as M. avium and 2 were identified as M. intracellulare by both routine methods and multiplex PCR. The remaining mycobacterium was identified as M. intracellulare by routine methods and as M. avium by the multiplex PCR. Another six blood cultures that were negative for the presence of acid-fast bacilli after Ziehl-Neelson staining were also negative by PCR. The study shows that the multiplex PCR is a useful method for the detection and identification of either M. avium or M. intracellulare in small samples of cultured BACTEC 13A fluid with positive GIs ranging from 21 to 999 U. The average time to positive GI was 18 days (median, 13 days) and ranged between 8 and 42 days. The multiplex PCR may permit cultured mycobacteria to be identified at an earlier stage than the routine methods which have been adapted for use with the BACTEC system. The results also show that the method selected for extracting mycobacterial DNA from blood culture fluids is crucial for providing sensitive and accurate PCR results."

Whilst the intradermal injection of partially purified derivatives of tuberculin (PPD) represents the classic test assessing the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response used in both humans and cattle for diagnosing TB, it has been suggested that the test may modulate host CMI responses. To investigate the kinetics of the development of the DTH response and its subsequent effect on CMI responses, groups of 6-month old calves were inoculated intranasally with 8 x 10(4) cfu of Mycobacterium bovis, subjected to the comparative intradermal tuberculin test (TT) using bovine and avian PPD (PPD-B, PPD-A) at various time intervals post-infection, and immune responses compared. These included DTH, lymphocyte proliferation, IgG production, and synthesis of the cytokines: IFNgamma, IL-10, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-13. All animals were subjected to post-mortem examination. The kinetics of the development of the DTH response assessed in the TT was such that infected cattle could be identified as early as 3 weeks post-infection, which correlated with the detection of an antigen-specific IFNgamma response. Transient increases in plasma-derived IFNgamma as a result of TT during an established TB infection were more pronounced when blood was stimulated with PPD-A compared with PPD-B stimulation. This has the potential to mask diagnosis of infection as a result of the stronger avian-bias if the IFNgamma test is used the week following TT. Disease pathology was not affected by TT. A transient failure to a second TT was observed in 1 of 30 animals and the time (post-infection) at which the TT is administered may be of significance. In serum, IgG responses to PPD-B, which were undetectable prior to TT, were elevated after TT and were most pronounced in cattle that were TT at 6 weeks post-infection. Other cytokines were also affected by the TT; IL-4 mRNA levels increased and IL-6 mRNA levels decreased, whilst PPD-B specific IL-10 protein synthesis was enhanced. These observations may offer the potential for further diagnostic assays that could complement the TT and IFNgamma test."

Because Mycobacterium tuberculosis control is affected by starvation and diabetes, we studied the role of the leptin receptor in regulating distinct immune cells during chronic infection. Infected db/db mice, bearing a natural mutation in the leptin receptor, have a markedly increased bacterial load in their lungs when compared with that of their wild-type counterparts. In response to M. tuberculosis infection, db/db mice exhibited disorganized granulomas, neutrophilia, and reduced B cell migration to the lungs, correlating with dysfunctional lung chemokine responses that include XCL1, CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL13. In a db/db lung, myeloid cells were delayed in their production of inducible NO synthase and had reduced expression of MHC I and II. Although the Th1 cell response developed normally in the absence of leptin signaling, production of pulmonary IFN- was delayed and ineffective. Surprisingly, a proper immune response took place in bone marrow (BM) chimeras lacking leptin receptor exclusively in BM-derived cells, indicating that leptin acts indirectly on immune cells to modulate the antituberculosis response and bacterial control. Together, these findings suggest that the pulmonary response to M. tuberculosis is affected by the host's nutritional status via the regulation of non-BM-derived cells, not through direct action of leptin on Th1 immunity."

This study was undertaken to estimate the number needed to screen (NNS) to identify a case of DM among those with TB symptoms and those with confirmed TB disease, and to identify factors predicting treatment outcomes of TB patients with and without DM. METHODS: Persons attending public-private model screening centres in urban Dhaka for the evaluation of TB were offered free blood glucose testing in addition to computer-aided chest X-ray and sputum Xpert MTB/RIF. RESULTS: Among 7647 people evaluated for both TB and DM, the NNS was 35 (95% confidence interval (CI) 31-40) to diagnose one new case of DM; among those diagnosed with TB, the NNS was 21 (95% CI 17-29). Among those with diagnosed TB, patients with DM were more likely to have cavitation on chest X-ray compared to those without DM (31% vs 22%). Treatment failure (odds ratio (OR) 18.9, 95% CI 5.43-65.9) and death (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.11-3.90) were more common among TB patients with DM than among TB patients without DM. DM was the most important predictor of a poor treatment outcome in the classification analysis for TB patients aged 39 years and above. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable burden of DM was found among patients accessing TB diagnostics through a public-private model in urban Bangladesh, and DM was associated with advanced TB disease and a high rate of poor treatment outcome."

Relatively little work has been done to characterize the immune response of WTD to M. bovis infection; however, an understanding of the immune response to infection and pathogenesis may be critical to the development of an effective vaccine. Immunological responses to infection were characterized by monitoring cytokine gene expression in M. bovis-infected and uninfected deer. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from infected WTD expressed more gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), interleukin-12p40 (IL-12p40), granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, and IL-4 mRNA than did PBL from uninfected deer; however, differences were not detected in expression of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta mRNA. Infected animals could be divided into two groups based on pathology. Lesions were confined primarily to the lymph nodes of the head in animals with less severe pathology.

More robust IFN-gamma mRNA expression correlated with pathology early in infection. These findings indicate that IFN-gamma expression likely plays a role in both protection and pathogenesis."

Infected TLR9(-/-) but not TLR2(-/-) mice displayed defective mycobacteria-induced interleukin (IL)-12p40 and interferon (IFN)-gamma responses in vivo, but in common with TLR2(-/-) animals, the TLR9(-/-) mice exhibited only minor reductions in acute resistance to low dose pathogen challenge. When compared with either of the single TLR-deficient animals, TLR2/9(-/-) mice displayed markedly enhanced susceptibility to infection in association with combined defects in proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro, IFN-gamma recall responses ex vivo, and altered pulmonary pathology. Cooperation between TLR9 and TLR2 was also evident at the level of the in vitro response to live M. tuberculosis, where dendritic cells and macrophages from TLR2/9(-/-) mice exhibited a greater defect in IL-12 response than the equivalent cell populations from single TLR9-deficient animals. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for TLR9 in the host response to M. tuberculosis and illustrate TLR collaboration in host resistance to a major human pathogen."

Diagnosis of leprosy is a major obstacle toward ultimate disease control and has been compromised in the past by the lack of specific markers. Comparative bioinformatic analysis among mycobacterial genomes identified potential M. leprae-specific proteins called ""hypothetical unknowns."" Due to massive gene decay and the prevalence of pseudogenes, it is unclear whether any of these proteins are expressed or are immunologically relevant. In this study, we performed cDNA-based quantitative real-time PCR to investigate the expression status of 131 putative open reading frames (ORFs) encoding hypothetical unknowns. Twenty-six of the M. leprae-specific antigen candidates showed significant levels of gene expression compared to that of ESAT-6 (ML0049), which is an important T cell antigen of low abundance in M. leprae. Fifteen of 26 selected antigen candidates were expressed and purified in Escherichia coli. The seroreactivity to these proteins of pooled sera from lepromatous leprosy patients and cavitary tuberculosis patients revealed that 9 of 15 recombinant hypothetical unknowns elicited M. leprae-specific immune responses. These nine proteins may be good diagnostic reagents to improve both the sensitivity and specificity of detection of individuals with asymptomatic leprosy."

This Th1 cytokine/mRNA synthesis was accompanied by an earlier accumulation of Mtb-specific Th1 cells in the lungs and the presence of CD4 T cells in lesions. An earlier generation of immunity was associated with an earlier inhibition of Mtb growth when infection was at a 1-log lower level. However, inhibition of Mtb growth in immunized, as well as in naive, mice was not followed by resolution of the infection, but by stabilization of the infection at a stationary level.

PARTICIPANTS: Serum, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-blood, and body fluid samples were obtained from 51 patients with active TB and 71 control subjects. The clinical diagnosis of TB was supported by a positive culture (n = 6), detection of acid-fast bacilli on smear (n = 35), or both (n = 10). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: IgA antibodies were detected in sera and/or body fluid samples from 82% of patients with TB and 10% of controls. M tuberculosis DNA was detected in body fluid sample of 96% and blood sample of 49% of patients with TB by PCR. None of the blood and 5.6% of the body fluid specimens from controls were PCR-positive. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-Kp 90 IgA antibodies were detected using ELISA in 78% of serum and 69% of body fluids from patients with TB, therefore, this test is promising for the diagnosis of active TB and appears to be more reliable, particularly for body fluid samples."

At the time of his hospital admission, his serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was elevated. After we started treatment using antituberculosis drugs, the infiltration shadow in his lung fields disappeared, and the serum CEA level decreased. The results suggest that the serum CEA level reflects the extent of the development of pulmonary tuberculosis lesions."

By adoptive transfer into nude mice of highly purified CD4+ T cells harvested during the recall of protective immunity it was confirmed that this population mediated both manifestations. However, the specificity of the T cells recruited during these processes were found to differ markedly; T cells involved in protection to a challenge with live tuberculosis bacilli recognized predominantly low-mass culture filtrate antigens below 15 000 MW, while cells recruited during DTH to PPD were directed to molecular mass fractions between 15 000 and 31 000. Using single purified antigens we showed that the latter cells recognized the secreted mycobacterial protein Ag85B and the heat-shock proteins, DnaK and GroEL.

A novel, rapid lateral flow assay, Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM (SILVAMP-LAM), detects the presence of TB lipoarabinomannan (LAM) in urine, and is substantially more sensitive for diagnosing TB in PLHIV than an earlier LAM assay (Alere Determine TB LAM lateral flow assay [LF-LAM]). Here, we present an individual participant data meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of SILVAMP-LAM in adult PLHIV, including both published and unpublished data. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult PLHIV (18 years) were assessed in 5 prospective cohort studies in South Africa (3 cohorts), Vietnam, and Ghana, carried out during 2012 to 2017. Of the 1,595 PLHIV who met eligibility criteria, the majority (61%) were inpatients, median age was 37 years (IQR 30-43), 43% had a CD4 count  100 cells/l, and 35% were receiving antiretroviral therapy. Most participants (94%) had a positive WHO symptom screen for TB on enrollment, and 45% were diagnosed with microbiologically confirmed TB, using mycobacterial culture or Xpert MTB/RIF testing of sputum, urine, or blood. Previously published data from inpatients were combined with unpublished data from outpatients. Biobanked urine samples were tested, using blinded double reading, with SILVAMP-LAM and LF-LAM. Applying a microbiological reference standard for assessment of sensitivity, the overall sensitivity for TB detection was 70.7% (95% CI 59.0%-80.8%) for SILVAMP-LAM compared to 34.9% (95% CI 19.5%-50.9%) for LF-LAM. Using a composite reference standard (which included patients with both microbiologically confirmed as well as clinically diagnosed TB), SILVAMP-LAM sensitivity was 65.8% (95% CI 55.9%-74.6%), and that of LF-LAM 31.4% (95% CI 19.1%-43.7%). In patients with CD4 count  100 cells/l, SILVAMP-LAM sensitivity was 87.1% (95% CI 79.3%-93.6%), compared to 56.0% (95% CI 43.9%-64.9%) for LF-LAM. In patients with CD4 count 101-200 cells/l, SILVAMP-LAM sensitivity was 62.7% (95% CI 52.4%-71.9%), compared to 25.3% (95% CI 15.8%-34.9%) for LF-LAM. In those with CD4 count > 200 cells/l, SILVAMP-LAM sensitivity was 43.9% (95% CI 34.3%-53.9%), compared to 10.9% (95% CI 5.2%-18.4%) for LF-LAM. Using a microbiological reference standard, the specificity of SILVAMP-LAM was 90.9% (95% CI 87.2%-93.7%), and that of LF-LAM 95.3% (95% CI 92.2%-97.7%). Limitations of this study include the use of biobanked, rather than fresh urine samples, and testing by skilled laboratory technicians in research laboratories, rather than at the point of care. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that SILVAMP-LAM identified a substantially higher proportion of TB patients in PLHIV than LF-LAM. The sensitivity of SILVAMP-LAM was highest in patients with CD4 count  100 cells/l. Further work is needed to demonstrate accuracy when implemented as a point-of-care test."

Protective efficacy of piperine was tested in a mice infection model of M. tuberculosis for the activation of Th-1 response and synergistic combination efficacy with rifampicin. Murine splenocytes exposed to piperine exhibited proliferation of T and B cell, increased Th-1 cytokines and enhanced macrophage activation. Piperine (1 mg/kg) in mice infected with M. tuberculosis activated the differentiation of T cells into Th-1 sub-population (CD4+ / CD8+ subsets). There was an increase in secretion of Th-1 cytokines (IFN- and IL-2) by these cells. The qRT-PCR studies revealed corresponding increases in the mRNA transcripts of IFN- and IL-2 in the infected lung tissues. Combination of piperine and rifampicin (1 mg/kg) exhibited better efficacy of and resulted in additional 1.4 to 0.8 log reduction in lung cfu as compared to rifampicin alone. The up-regulation of Th1 immunity by piperine can be synergistically combined with rifampicin to improve its therapeutic efficacy in immune-compromised TB patients."

Among TB patients, 10 (58.8%) of 17 HIV-2-infected persons had detectable plasma RT activity compared with 30 (75%) of 40 HIV-1-infected persons (p =.342). In contrast, among patients with CD4+ cell counts >500 x 106/L, none of 26 HIV-2-infected persons had detectable RT activity compared with 13 (52%) of 25 HIV-1-infected persons (p <.001). Our data suggest that unlike HIV-1 infection, HIV-2 infections with CD4+ cell counts >500 x 106/L are associated with a low level of viral replication, which may explain the longer clinical latency and lower transmissibility seen in HIV-2 infection."

Its diagnosis is based on the detection of cell mediated immunity under the exposure to protein purified derivative tuberculin (PPD), a complex and poorly characterized reagent. The cross-reactivity to non-tuberculous mycobacterium species (false-positive results) has been crucial to develop a more proper antigen. In the present study, we selected six M.bovis Open Reading Frames (Mb1992, Mb2031c, Mb2319, Mb2843c, Mb2845c and Mb3212c) by in-silico analysis and evaluated them in experimental and natural infection; none of these antigens had been previously assessed as diagnostic antigens for bTB. The reactivity performance was tested in animals with both positive and negative Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) results as well as in cattle infected with Mycobacterium avium subesp. paratuberculosis (MAP). The six recombinant antigens individually induced an IFN- response, with overall responder frequency ranging from 18.3 to 31%. Mb2845c was the most valuable antigen with the potential to discriminate TST-positive cattle from either TST-negative or MAP infected animals. Mb2845c showed similar performance to that observed with ESAT-6 and PPD-B among TST and MTC specific-PCR positive animals, although this result needs to be proven in further studies with a higher sample size. Our data confirm the feacibility to implement bioinformatic screening tools and suggest Mb2845c as a potential diagnostic antigen to be tested in protein cocktails to evaluate their contribution to bTB diagnosis."

We report that  T cells from virulent M. bovis-infected cattle respond specifically and directly to complex, protein, and nonprotein mycobacterial Ags. Importantly, to our knowledge, we demonstrate for the first time that bovine  T cells specifically recognize peptide Ags derived from the mycobacterial protein complex ESAT6:CFP10 and that this recognition requires direct contact with APCs and signaling through the T cell Ag receptor but is independent of MHC class I or II. Furthermore, we show that M. bovis infection in cattle induces robust IL-17A protein responses. Interestingly, in contrast to results from mice, bovine CD4 T cells, and not  T cells, are the predominant source of this critical proinflammatory mediator. Bovine  T cells are divided into subsets based upon their expression of Workshop Cluster 1 (WC1), and we demonstrate that the M. bovis-specific  T cell response is composed of a heterogeneous mix of WC1-expressing populations, with the serologically defined WC1.1(+) and WC1.2(+) subsets responding in vitro to mycobacterial Ags and accumulating in the lesions of M. bovis-infected animals. The results described in this article enhance our understanding of  T cell biology and, because virulent M. bovis infection of cattle represents an excellent model of tuberculosis in humans, contribute to our overall understanding of the role of  T cells in the mycobacterial-specific immune response."

METHODS: A systematic sample of adults attending for HIV care, regardless of symptomatology, were enrolled in the XPHACTOR study, which tested a novel algorithm for prioritising investigation with Xpert MTB/RIF. In this substudy, restricted to participants with enrolment CD4<200x106/l, urine was stored at enrolment for later testing with LF-LAM. Sputum was sent for immediate Xpert MTB/RIF if any of: current cough, fever 3 weeks, body mass index (BMI)<18.5kg/m2, CD4<100x106/l (or <200x106/l if pre-ART), weight loss 10% or strong clinical suspicion were present; otherwise, sputum was stored for Xpert testing at study completion. Participants were reviewed monthly, with reinvestigation if indicated, to 3 months, when sputum and blood were taken for mycobacterial culture. We defined tuberculosis as ""confirmed"" if Xpert, line probe assay or culture for M. tuberculosis within six months of enrolment were positive, and ""clinical"" if tuberculosis treatment started without microbiological confirmation. RESULTS: Amongst 424 participants, 61% were female and 57% were taking ART (median duration 22 months); median age, CD4 and BMI were 39 years, 111x106/l, and 23 kg/m2. 56/424 (13%) participants had tuberculosis (40 confirmed, 16 clinical). 24/424 (5.7%) vs. 8/424 (1.9%) were LAM-positive using grade 1 vs. grade 2 cut-off. Using grade 1 cut-off, sensitivity for confirmed TB (all clinical TB excluded) was 12.5% (95% CI 4.2%, 26.8%) and in CD4<100x106/l vs. CD4 100x106/l was 16.7% (95% CI 4.7%, 37.4%) vs. 6.3% (95% CI 0.2%, 30.2%).

PPD- and live M.tb-induced IFN-gamma-production were observed in CD4(+), CD8(+), gammadeltaTCR(+), and CD56(+) alveolar T cell subpopulations and NK cells (CD3(-)CD56(+)). IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) T cells (mostly CD45RO(+)) were more abundant (p<0.05). M.tb-induced IL-12p70, but interestingly also IL-4, was increased (p<0.05) in BACs from TB patients.

However, in the last years there has been an increase of bovine tuberculosis cases, particularly in the southern part of Germany, in the Allgu region. As a consequence a one-time tuberculosis surveillance program was revisited with different premortal and postmortal tests. The aim of this paper was to estimate diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of the different tests used within this surveillance program. In the absence of a perfect test with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, thus in the absence of a gold standard, a Bayesian latent class approach with two different datasets was performed. The first dataset included 389 animals, tested with single intra-dermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test, PCR and pathology; the second dataset contained 175 animals, tested with single intra-dermal cervical tuberculin (SICT) test, Bovigam assay, pathology and culture. Two-way conditional dependencies were considered within the models. Additionally, inter-laboratory agreement (five officially approved laboratories) of the Bovigam assay was assessed with Cohen's kappa test (21 blood samples). The results are given in posterior means and 95% credibility intervals. The specificities of the SICT test, SICCT test, PCR and pathology ranged between 75.8% [68.8-82.2%] and 99.0% [96.8-100%]. The Bovigam assay stood out with a very low specificity (6.9% [3.6-11.1%]), though it had the highest sensitivity (95.7% [91.3-99.2%]). The sensitivities of the SICCT test, PCR, SICT test, pathology and culture varied from 57.8% [48.0-67.6%] to 88.9% [65.5-99.7%]. The prevalences were 19.8% [14.6-26.5%] (three-test dataset) and 7.7% [4.2-12.3%] (four-test dataset). Among all pairwise comparisons the highest agreement was 0.62 [0.15-1]). In conclusion, the specificity of the Bovigam assay and the inter-laboratory agreement were lower than expected."

Analysis of IL-5 mRNA in spleen cell preparations by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed the presence of message for this cytokine in uninfected severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. This message was increased following Mycobacterium avium infection. Normal BALB/c mice had higher levels of expression of IL-5 but the expression of this cytokine was reduced during M. avium infection. Anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody administration in vivo to SCID mice reduced the number of peritoneal and splenic eosinophils. Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) had an inhibitory effect of eosinophilopoiesis during infection of SCID mice by M. avium since neutralization of this cytokine increased the number of eosinophils detected in the peritoneal cavity of infected animals. Our results suggest that IL-5 may be produced by cells other than T cells that are both able to respond to infection and are under the control of IFN-gamma.

Expression of PRLr isoforms in lymphoid tissues has been associated with immunomodulatory function of prolactin. Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is characterized by chronic inflammation caused by the persistent infection of lymphoid tissues with Mycobacterium bovis. To test the hypothesis of the influence of PRLr in the pathogenesis of bTB, the aim of this study was to identify PRLr isoforms expressed during bTB in different tissues and to analyze their association with the pathogenesis of bTB. We examined lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues ex vivo from experimentally and naturally infected cattle, as well as from bTB-free cattle, by Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IH). In vitro, monocytes from exposed, infected, and healthy cattle were stimulated with M. bovis antigens and then analyzed by WB. To detect transcriptional levels of PRLr in macrophages (M) exposed to M. bovis, real time PCR was performed. WB revealed diversity of PRLr isoforms in tissues from infected cattle but not in tissues from bTB-free cattle. PRLr isoforms 100 kDa 75, 50 and 40 were found expressed in tissues of animals infected with M. bovis, while only the short isoform of 40 kDa correlated with the immunopathology and ability to infect M. We confirmed the synthesis of PRLr mRNA in M after M. bovis exposure and propose that molecular pathogen patterns of M. bovis might modulate inflammation during bTB through expression of the PRLr isoform in M."

In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric gene vaccine. The Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pCI-neo. C57BL/6N mice were vaccinated with Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric gene vaccine for three times at 3 weeks intervals. Four weeks after the final inoculation, three mice per group were sacrificed to assess cytokine response and CTL induction and the other five mice per group were challenged intravenously in a lateral tail vein with 1 x 10(6) CFU of virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Spleen and the left lung were harvested from each mouse at 4 weeks after infection and homogenized in sterile saline. Serial dilutions of organ homogenates were plated on L-J agar and incubated 37 degrees C until colonies were visible 4 weeks later. Protective efficacies in each experiment were expressed as reduced CFU and were compared with the negative control group. The right lung was obtained from each mouse and immediately inflated with and stored in 10% formalin saline. Tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric gene vaccine induced the secretion of more of Th1 cytokines, but not IL-4 and enhanced CTL activity. Mice immunized with Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric gene vaccine had fewer and smaller tubercles than control groups. As expected, control mice had the highest bacterial loads in both lung and spleen. Immunization with Mtb8.4/hIL-12 chimeric gene vaccine could remarkably reduced CFU counts in organs. When it was used to construct the chimeric gene vaccine, hIL-12 could improve the immune efficacy of Mtb8.4 gene vaccine."

Multiple aneurysms caused by tuberculosis (TB) are difficult to treat. Here, we discuss a treatment modality using a microcore stent graft. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 73-year-old man with pain in the back and on the right side of the chest associated with dry cough, presented with an inability to walk since 1-month. DIAGNOSES: A diagnosis of multiple aneurysms caused by TB was made, based on computed tomography (CT) scan and positive T-spot and Xpert tests. INTERVENTIONS: We administered the empirical anti-TB regimen (pyrazinamide, isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol) and performed endovascular repair using microcore stent graft. OUTCOMES: The post-operative hemodynamic analysis indicated that the patient's aneurysms no longer had a risk of rupture, and blood flow in the major branches of the aorta had been maintained. However, the patient could not survive due to a pulmonary infection acquired during recuperation at a local hospital. LESSONS: For multiple tuberculous mycotic aneurysms, anti-TB therapy is inadequate and the microcore stent graft is a feasible option that can improve the hemodynamics in the aneurysms."

Furthermore, the possibility of shedding of the vaccine strain and the influence of the vaccination on the tuberculin skin test was determined. In addition to standard procedures recently developed diagnostic methods (antibody enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, interferon-gamma test, polymerase chain reaction) were used. A cell-mediated immune reaction, reflected in an increased, specifically induced, interferon-gamma production developed much earlier (1-2 weeks post-immunization) than humoral immunity (8-16 weeks post-gamma immunization). While the increase in antibody titres was transient, declining to extremely low levels 48-60 weeks post-immunization, cell-mediated immunity remained detectable until the end of the investigation. Spread of the vaccine strain into the body and shedding were never detected during the whole course of the study except for one colon site in one calf. As late as 2 years after vaccine application positive or doubtful skin reactions against M. bovis purified protein derivative were measured, reflecting possible interference of the immunization with the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis. At the end of the investigation, a positive cell-mediated immune reaction was detected the control animal although clinical, pathological and bacteriological examinations gave no indication for a mycobacterial infection."

METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 2710 dairy cows from 11 herds in six Governorates were tested by SCT and 444 (164%) were TB reactors. Only 65 cows responded to M. bovis antigen by RT and TB-Feron. A postmortem examination showed that 49 (754%) of slaughtered cows have visible lesions. Testing of 215 out 444 SCT reactor cows by culture and PCR using blood and milk samples revealed that M. bovis were more frequently identified in the blood (61-205%) than milk (23-56%) samples. Additionally, in this study, we investigated the prevalence and potential risk factors associated with M. bovis infection in dairy farm workers. Overall, 100 dairy farm workers were tested using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) and 35 (35%) were positive. In all, 23 (23%) of MTC positive were M. bovis positive using PCR. Mycobacterium bovis positive cases were associated with workers who had respiratory signs and did not wash or disinfect their hands after handling cows. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of M. bovis in dairy cows and dairy farm workers under the intensive dairy production system in Egypt is high. It is therefore essential to disseminate effective prevention and control measures to prevent the spread of M. bovis between dairy cows and dairy workers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed that the use of RT or TB-Feron as an ancillary test of SCT reactor cows resulted in a significant reduction in the SCT false-positive slaughtered cows. A high prevalence of M. bovis infection among farm workers provides evidence of occupational risk in the intensive dairy production system in Egypt."

METHODS: The unstimulated WB and PBMC from 1417 individuals with active pulmonary TB patients, other lung diseases and healthy participants were analyzed using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The WB cohort test demonstrates that the combination of GBP5 and KLF2 can differentiate active TB versus HC with sensitivity and specificity of 77.8% and 87.1%, respectively; but most importantly active TB versus OD with sensitivity and specificity of 96.1% and 85.2%, respectively. Again during treatment course, the TB score of GBP5 and KLF2, analytes secretion and clinical parameters were found to be associated in disease progression. In the PBMC cohort test, we found that the only and best discriminatory combination was GBP5, DUSP3 and KLF2 inthe active TB versus HC with a sensitivity and specificity of 76.4% and 85.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that GBP5 and KLF2 may be useful as a diagnostic tool for active TB, also the two-gene set may serve as surrogate biomarkers for monitoring TB therapy."

The impact of this molecule in the context of chronic infections remains unknown. We found that specific Sirt2 deletion in the myeloid lineage transiently increased Mycobacterium tuberculosis load in the lungs and liver of conditional mice. Sirt2 did not affect long-term infection since no significant differences were observed in the bacterial burden at days 60 and 120 post-infection. The initial increase in M. tuberculosis growth was not due to differences in inflammatory cell infiltrates in the lung, myeloid or CD4+ T cells. The transcription levels of IFN-, IL-17, TNF, IL-6 and NOS2 were also not affected in the lungs by Sirt2-myeloid specific deletion. Overall, our results demonstrate that Sirt2 expression has a transitory effect in M. tuberculosis infection. Thus, modulation of Sirt2 activity in vivo is not expected to affect chronic infection with M. tuberculosis."

Western blot results were examined for reactivity patterns associating humoral response with infection status, severity and type of lesions (diffuse vs. multifocal granulomatous inflammation) and phenotype (white vs. non-white). A sensitivity of 88.24% and a specificity of 100% were achieved utilizing Western blot analysis to detect M. a. avium infection in ring-neck doves, offering a negative predictive value of 93% and a positive predictive value of 100%. While Western blot analysis results did not reflect lesion severity, lesion type did partially correspond with the humoral response. The findings of the present study indicate that serologic testing can be used as a valuable ante mortem screening tool for identifying ring-neck doves infected with M. a. avium."

Our previous study showed interferon (IFN)- and CD3 T cell impairment in patients with severe cavitary pulmonary TB (PTB). However, the cause of the change in immune responses during the progression of TB is still poorly understood. In this study, eight newly diagnosed patients with severe cavitary and mild lesion non-cavity PTB were recruited, and three healthy volunteers were recruited as the control. RNA extracted from blood was tested by whole genome oligo microarrays. A PCR array was used to further test the same samples. Two additional groups of patients were recruited according to the same criteria with healthy control(HC) recruited as well and subjected to peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation (PBMC)and analysis of TCF-7, -catenin, cyclin D2, IFN-, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- expression in CD14- cells (lymphocytes) and CD14+ cells by quantitative PCR. The changes of expression of -catenin, CD69+ and IFN- by CD3+, CD14- and CD14+ cells in vitro with stimulation of LiCl were tested by flow cytometry. Whole genome oligo microarrays showed a significant decrease in expression of the Wnt signaling pathway in severe PTB patients. Further analysis of the Wnt pathway by PCR array indicated that TCF-7, -catenin, and cyclin D2 expression was significantly reduced in severe PTB patients compared with mild PTB patients. In the additionally recruited patients, TCF-7, -catenin, and cyclin D2 were expressed in both CD14+ and CD14- cells, while -catenin was decreased significantly in CD14- cells compared with CD14+ cells in severe PTB patients, and IFN- and TNF- expression in CD14- cells was also reduced significantly in severe PTB patients. -catenin can directly trigger T cell activation and IFN-secretion in PBMCs stimulated for 24 hours. These findings indicate that Wnt pathway and its key genes, such as -catenin, were impaired in blood cells of patients with severe PTB. Therefore, Wnt/-catenin pathway is closely associated with T cell proliferation and TB lesion deterioration."

From an epidemiological study in Colombia, we selected three Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with meningeal tuberculosis, and used them to infect BALB/c mice through the intratracheal route. These strains showed a distinctive spoligotype pattern. The course of infection in terms of strain virulence (mice survival, bacillary loads in lungs), bacilli dissemination and extrapulmonary infection (bacilli loads in blood, brain, liver, kidney and spleen), and immune responses (cytokine expression determined by real time PCR in brain and lung) was studied and compared with that induced by the laboratory strain H37Rv and other five clinical strains isolated from patients with pulmonary TB. All the clinical isolates from meningeal TB patients disseminated extensively through the hematogenous route infecting the brain, producing inflammation in the cerebral parenchyma and meninges, whereas H37Rv and clinical isolates from pulmonary TB patients showed very limited efficiency to infect the brain. Thus, it seems that mycobacterial strains with a distinctive genotype are able to disseminate extensively after the respiratory infection and infect the brain."

This research aimed to investigate the effect of CS on PA-824 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infected mice (female CBA/J mice, 6 to 8 weeks of age and 202 g of weight). Mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups: PA-824, CS, PA-824+CS, and control. To verify the effect of PA-824 and CS on M.tb, after drug administration, mice lungs were harvested and bacterial colony formations were measured. Cells were isolated from infected lungs and spleens to analyze the percentage of CD4+ T cells (CD11a positive). Lung cells were cultured to detect the secretion of interferon- (IFN-) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) by ELISA. IFN- and IL-10 double-positive CD4+ cells in peripheral blood were measured by flow cytometry. The expression levels of IL-2 and IL-10 in mice lungs were analyzed by real-time PCR and western blot. Results showed that PA-824 combined with CS led to the lowest lung colony-forming units (CFU) counts among treated groups. Furthermore, this beneficial outcome might be associated with the decreased CD11a on CD4+ cells in mice lungs and spleens. Moreover, the suppressed secretion of IFN- and IL-10, and IL-10 expressions, as well as the decreased IFN- and IL-10 double-positive CD4+ cells in blood, could also be associated with the positive effect. However, no significant effect on IL-2 production was found. The combination of PA-824 and CS had more effective bacteriostatic and immunomodulatory effects on M.tb infected mice than PA-824 alone. In conclusion, CS has the potential to be an effective adjuvant in TB treatment."

We investigated the sample processing and assay parameters necessary for highly-sensitive detection of bloodstream bacteria, using Staphylococcus aureus as a model pathogen and an automated fluidic sample processing-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform as a model diagnostic system. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared a short 128 bp amplicon hemi-nested PCR and a relatively shorter 79 bp amplicon nested PCR targeting the S. aureus nuc and sodA genes, respectively. The sodA nested assay showed an enhanced limit of detection (LOD) of 5 genomic copies per reaction or 10 colony forming units (CFU) per ml blood over 50 copies per reaction or 50 CFU/ml for the nuc assay. To establish optimal extraction protocols, we investigated the relative abundance of the bacteria in different components of the blood (white blood cells (WBCs), plasma or whole blood), using the above assays. The blood samples were obtained from the patients who were culture positive for S. aureus. Whole blood resulted in maximum PCR positives with sodA assay (90% positive) as opposed to cell-associated bacteria (in WBCs) (71% samples positive) or free bacterial DNA in plasma (62.5% samples positive). Both the assays were further tested for direct detection of S. aureus in patient whole blood samples that were contemporaneous culture positive. S. aureus was detected in 40/45 of culture-positive patients (sensitivity 89%, 95% CI 0.75-0.96) and 0/59 negative controls with the sodA assay (specificity 100%, 95% CI 0.92-1). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated a highly sensitive two-hour assay for detection of sepsis causing bacteria like S. aureus directly in 1 ml of whole blood, without the need for blood culture."

However, there are several reports that serum CA-125 is elevated in tuberculosis. This study investigated the clinical significance of serum CA-125 measurements in patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Between September 2008 and March 2011, Serum CA-125 was measured in patients with active pulmonary TB before treatment (baseline), and 6 and 12 months after initiation of anti-TB treatment. Patients with pulmonary TB confirmed by culture or polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB-PCR) were included. The study enrolled 100 patients. The mean serum CA-125 was 38.941.4U/ml (reference value, <35U/ml). Thirty-eight patients showed elevated CA-125. Significantly more of those with elevated CA-125 were female (p<0.001), and had a positive sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) (p=0.030). They also significantly more showed extensive pulmonary lesions on chest X-ray (p=0.004). Elevated CA-125 was independently associated with female gender (OR=12.5, 95% CI: 3.4-45.2), positive acid-fast staining of sputum (OR=6.0, 95% CI: 1.8-19.7), cavitary lung lesion (OR=4.0, 95% CI: 1.2-12.9), and involvement of more than one lung on chest X-ray (OR=9.4, 95% CI: 2.2-40.1). The CA-125 level decreased with anti-TB treatment (p=0.001). Serum CA-125 was related to the activity and severity of pulmonary TB, and it may be useful in the monitoring of therapeutic responses in certain cases of active pulmonary TB, especially in female patients of active pulmonary TB."

METHODS: Details of the cases of a total of 124 TB patients were collected at Qilu Hospital of Shandong University between April 2014 and April 2015. Fifty-three of these patients had sputum positive for bacteria and a cavity on imaging (group A), 20 patients had sputum negative for bacteria and a cavity on imaging (group B), and 51 patients had sputum negative for bacteria and no cavity on imaging (group C). One hundred seventeen healthy people who attended the hospital for a physical examination were recruited as controls. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the levels of sputum and serum miR-144 before anti-TB treatment and at 1 month after treatment. RESULTS: Before treatment, sputum and serum miR-144 expression levels in the TB patients were both higher than those of the controls (both p<0.05). After treatment, sputum and serum miR-144 levels in the TB patients were significantly lower than those measured before treatment (both p<0.05). The levels of sputum and serum miR-144 in the improved TB patients decreased significantly after treatment compared to those measured before treatment (both p<0.001). Significant differences were found in sputum and serum miR-144 levels in the TB patients, with or without improvement, compared with the healthy controls (all p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Sputum and serum miR-144 levels were significantly upregulated in the TB patients, but were found to decrease significantly after anti-TB treatment."

Clinical data were collected from 254 spinal TB patients and 262 healthy controls participating in the study. The genotype of the MIF-173G/C gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and genotyped by DNA sequencing technology. The level of mRNA expression was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and MIF plasma levels were measured by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The frequency of the C allele and GC+CC genotype in MIF-173G/C was over-represented in spinal TB patients. The mean MIF mRNA level in spinal TB patients and patients with the GG and GC+CC genotype were significantly lower than controls; however, our study also indicated that the MIF concentration in spinal TB patients and patients with the GG and GC+CC genotypes were significantly higher than controls. Spinal TB patients with the GG genotype had higher MIF plasma levels than patients with the GC+CC genotype. The C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was correlated with the MIF plasma level. In summary, the association between the MIF-173G/C genetic polymorphism, reduced transcript and increased plasma levels of MIF in spinal TB patients, and MIF may play an important role in the occurrence, development, and damage of spinal TB in the northern Province population of China."

Therefore, we determined the prevalence of MAP in patients with CD and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and its association with clinical course. METHODOLOGY: Blood and intestinal biopsies were taken from 69 CD, 32 ITB patients and 41 patients with haemorrhoidal bleed who served as controls. qPCR targeting of MAP-specific IS900 gene was used to detect the presence of MAP DNA. qPCR results were further validated by sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the presence of MAP antigen in biopsy specimens. CD and ITB patients were followed-up for disease course and response to therapy. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The frequency of MAP-specific DNA in biopsies by qPCR was significantly higher in CD patients (23.2%, p = 0.03) as compared to controls (7.3%). No significant difference in intestinal MAP presence was observed between ITB patients (12.5%, p = 0.6) and controls (7.3%). MAP presence in blood of CD patients was 10.1% as compared to 4.9% in controls while no patients with ITB were found to be positive (p = 0.1). Using IHC for detection of MAP antigen, the prevalence of MAP in CD was 2.9%, 12.5% in ITB patients and 2.4% in controls. However, long-term follow-up of the patients revealed no significant associations between clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes with MAP positivity. CONCLUSION: We report significantly high prevalence of MAP in intestinal biopsies of CD patients. However, the presence of MAP does not affect the disease course and treatment outcomes in either CD or ITB patients."

We screened the differentially expressed serum microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. METHODS: In this study, serum miRNAs were screened using the Solexa sequencing method as the potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. The stem-loop quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay was used to verify differentially expressed serum miRNAs. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and logistic regression model were used to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of the single miRNA and a combination of miRNAs for diagnosis, respectively. Using the predicted target genes, we constructed the regulatory networks of miRNAs and genes that were related to pulmonary TB. RESULTS: The Solexa sequencing data showed that 91 serum miRNAs were differentially expressed in pulmonary TB patients, compared to healthy controls. Following qRT-PCR confirmation, six serum miRNAs (hsa-miR-378, hsa-miR-483-5p, hsa-miR-22, hsa-miR-29c, hsa-miR-101 and hsa-miR-320b) showed significant difference among pulmonary TB patients, healthy controls (P<0.001) and differential diagnosis groups (including patients with pneumonia, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) (P<0.05). The logistic regression analysis of a combination of six serum miRNAs revealed that the sensitivity and the specificity of TB diagnosis were 95.0% and 91.8% respectively. The miRNAs-gene regulatory networks revealed that several miRNAs may regulate some target genes involved in immune pathways and participate in the pathogenesis of pulmonary TB. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that a combination of six serum miRNAs have great potential to serve as non-invasive biomarkers of pulmonary TB."

METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-eight HIV-exposed Indian infants at a median age of 5 months (range 1-18) had DNA PCR and CD4, CD8 counts performed. RESULTS: Fifty five infants tested positive by HIV-1 DNA PCR whereas 203 were negative. Median CD4 count, CD4% and CD4/CD8 ratio were significantly lower in DNA PCR+ infants. Overall sensitivity and specificity of CD4/CD8 ratio <1.0 in predicting HIV was 91 and 92% with a negative predicted value (NPV) and positive predicted value (PPV) of 97 and 76%, respectively. CONCLUSION: CD4/CD8 ratio <1.0 is a more sensitive surrogate marker of HIV infection in Indian infants than a CD4 count <1500 cells/l or CD4% <25%."

Bacterial load and histopathological lesions in lungs or spleens of mice challenged with Myco. tuberculosis H37Rv strain were analysed. Compared with incomplete Freund's adjuvant, CpG7909 induced more potent production of Pe685a-specific IgG2a/IgG1 antibody and higher expression of IFN- in sera, stimulated more generation of antigen-specific IFN--secreting splenocytes, enhanced frequencies of CD3(+) CD4(+) and CD3(+) CD8(+) T-lymphocytes in spleen and increased transcription of TNF-, IFN-, IL-6 and TLR9 in lung. However, lower bacterial load in lung and less severe lung pathology were not observed in CpG7909 group mice. CONCLUSIONS: CpG7909 is able to enhance immunological effects of Pe685a subunit vaccine, but does not confer significant protective efficacy against Myco. tuberculosis infection. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: CpG7909 as an adjuvant of subunit vaccine against Myco. tuberculosis is worthy of further investigation."

We undertook a study to identify host factors associated with such clinical variability. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A comparative study between groups of active TB patients vs. clinically normal household contacts, family members living under the same roof with the patients for a long period of time, was carried out. We screened 22 candidate cytokines and chemokines in the plasma of 119 pairs (""discovery set"") of TB patients and their asymptomatic household contacts. Identified associations were validated in an independent cohort of 78 patient-household contact pairs (""validation set""). Validated associations were further cross-validated by gene expression assays using RT-PCR and in-vitro whole blood stimulation by mycobacterial antigens ESAT6 and Rv2031c, two well-characterized antigens that are expressed in active and latent phases of disease, respectively. In a concomitant SNP association study, we have sequenced the validated gene in these patients and household contacts. RESULT: CXCL10 was found to be the most significantly (p=0.0002) elevated chemokine - discovered and validated -- in patients' plasma compared to their household contacts. We found that CXCL10 was overexpressed by 5-fold at the RNA level in patients compared to asymptomatic household contacts (p=0.004). On stimulation of whole blood collected from normal healthy volunteers with mycobacterial antigens ESAT6 and Rv2031c, we found that production of CXCL10 by ESAT6 was significantly higher (p=2.810(-12)) than Rv2031c. The production of CXCL10 was 20-fold more than IFN-, the most widely validated cytokine, by ESAT6 stimulation (p=4.610(-8)). One of the polymorphisms in promoter of CXCL10, rs4508917 (-1447 A>G), was identified as a proteinQTL (pQTL). Reduced expression of CXCL10 was observed among individuals with GG genotype, but the reduction was statistically significant only among controls, but not among patients. Among patients, the expression level was very high compared to the controls irrespective of the genotypes at this locus. CONCLUSION: Plasma level of CXCL10 is predictive of the active phase of TB infection."

DNA fragments encoding TB16.3 and echA1 gene regions corresponding to proteins TB16.3 and echA1 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis were amplified through PCR. Through a series of restrictions and ligations two novel fusion constructs TB16.3-echA1 and TB16.3-tnPstS1 were produced and expressed in Escherichia coli. These were screened for detection of antibodies in human plasma. The individual antigens TB16.3, echA1 and tnPstS1 and the fusion protein TB16.3-tnPstS1 and TB16.3-echA1 showed sensitivities of 29%, 25.5%, 42.8%, 40.0% and 47.2%, respectively. Lower sensitivity in case of TB16.3-tnPstS1 seems to be due to the structural arrangement between the two proteins, which is likely to mask several of their epitopes. The higher sensitivity of TB16.3-echA1 appears to be due to lesser interaction between the two proteins thus allowing free availability of epitopes for binding antibodies. 64% of TB patients were found positive for either one of the two fusion proteins TB16.3-echA1 and TB16.3-tnPstS1. This study indicates that the novel fusion protein TB16.3-echA1 has a potential in serodiagnosis of TB with improved sensitivity and reliability."

Pleural effusions (PEs) in TB are representative of lymphocytic PEs which are dominated by T cells. However, the mechanism underlying T lymphocytes homing and accumulation in PEs is still incompletely understood. Here we performed a comparative analysis of cytokine abundance in PEs from TB patients and non-TB patients by protein array analysis and observed that MCP-2/CCL8 is highly expressed in the TB-PEs as compared to peripheral blood. Meanwhile, we observed that CCR5, the primary receptor used by MCP-2/CCL8, is mostly expressed on pleural CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Furthermore, we found that infection with either Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv induced production of MCP-2/CCL8 at both transcriptional and protein level in Raw264.7 and THP-1 macrophage cells, mouse peritoneal macrophages as well as human PBMC monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). The induction of MCP-2/CCL8 by mycobacteria is dependent on the activation of TLR2/PI3K/Akt and p38 signaling pathway. We conclude that accumulation of MCP-2/CCL8 in TB-PEs may function as a biomarker for TB diagnosis."

In the present study, the immunomodulatory effect of MIP in conjunction with chemotherapy against M.tb infection was evaluated by colony forming units (CFUs) following aerosol infection to guinea pig and by measuring CXCL12 chemokine expression using q-PCR and in situ RT-PCR. Different experimental groups included, infection (Rv), immunoprophylaxis (RvMw), chemotherapy (RvCh) and combination of immunoprophylaxis+chemotherapy (RvChMw) group and normal healthy (NH) group. In the combination of immunoprophylaxis+chemotherapy (RvChMw) group, the CFU counts reduced significantly (p<0.001) at 4th week of infection as compared to other treated groups (RvMw and RvCh group). The expression of CXCL12 was recorded in all the treated groups of animals. The study demonstrated suppressed expression of CXCL 12 in both immunoprophylaxis as well as chemotherapy groups (6th and 8th week) that become elevated in immunoprophylaxis plus chemotherapy group (10th week), at which time point no CFUs were detected in RvCh and RvChMw group. The findings indicate that the expression of CXCL12 is associated with good response to anti - tubercular treatment. Thus, prior immunization with MIP appears to show good immunomodulatory effect to release CXCL12 chemokine during infection and also correlates with enhanced effect to chemotherapy."

METHODS: We assessed the performance of published TB transcriptomic signatures in Haiti, and identified transcriptomic biomarkers of TB bacterial load in sputum as measured by Xpert MTB/RIF molecular testing. People in Port au Prince, Haiti, with untreated pulmonary TB (n = 51) formed the study cohort: 19 people with low and 32 with high sputum Mycobacterium tuberculosis load. Peripheral whole blood transcriptomes were generated using RNA sequencing. RESULTS: Twenty of the differentially expressed transcripts in TB vs. no TB were differentially expressed in people with low vs. high sputum mycobacterial loads. The difference between low and high bacterial load groups was independent of radiographic severity. In a published data set of transcriptomic response to anti-tuberculosis treatment, this 20-gene subset was more treatment-responsive at 6 months than the full active TB signature. CONCLUSION: We identified genes whose transcript levels in the blood distinguish active TB with high vs. low M. tuberculosis loads in the sputum. These transcripts may reveal mechanisms of mycobacterial control of M. tuberculosis during active infection, as well as identifying potential biomarkers for bacterial response to anti-tuberculosis treatment."

Forty-eight New Zealand white rabbits were collected and divided into four groups: experimental group (n=30, spinal tuberculosis model was established), the sham group (n=15, sham operation was performed) and the blank group (n=3). The qRT-PCR assay and western blotting were applied to detect the mRNA and protein expressions of MCP-1 and NF-B in peripheral blood. ELISA was used to measure serum levels of MCP-1, NF-B, IFN-, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10. Flow cytometry was adopted to assess the distributions of CD4+, CD8+ lymphocytes and CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3 lymphocyte subsets. Compared with the sham and blank groups, the mRNA and protein expressions of MCP-1 and NF-B in the experimental group were significantly increased. The experimental group had lower serum levels of IL-2 and IFN- and higher serum level of IL-10 than the sham and blank groups. In comparison to the sham and blank groups, CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets percentage, CD4+/CD8+ ratio and CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ Tregs subsets accounting for CD4+ lymphocyte in the experimental group were lower, while percentage of CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets was higher. Our study provided evidence that higher expression of MCP-1 and NF-B may be associated with decreased immune function of spinal tuberculosis, which can provide a new treatment direction for spinal tuberculosis."

However, the mechanisms for Th1/Th2 imbalance are still not well determined. Notch signaling pathway is involved in the peripheral T cell activation and effector cell differentiation. However, whether it affects Th1/Th2 imbalance in TB patients is still not known. Here, we used -secretase inhibitor (DAPT) to treat the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy people or individuals with latent or active TB infection in vitro, respectively. Then, the Th1/Th2 ratios were determined by flow cytometry, and cytokines of IFN-, IL-4, IL-10 in the culture supernatant were measured by CBA method. The Notch signal pathway associated proteins Hes1, GATA3 and T-bet were quantitated by real-time PCR or immunoblotting. Our results showed that DAPT effectively inhibited the protein level of Hes1. In TB patients, the Th2 ratio increased in the PBMCs, alone with the high expression of GATA3 and IL-4, resulting in the high ratios of Th2/Th1 and GATA3/T-bet in TB patients. However, Th2 cells ratio decreased after blocking the Notch signaling pathway by DAPT and the Th2/Th1 ratio in TB patients were DAPT dose-dependent, accompanied by the decrease of IL-4 and GATA3. But, its influence on Th1 ratio and Th1 related T-bet and IFN- levels were not significant. In conclusion, our results suggest that blocking Notch signaling by DAPT could inhibit Th2 responses and restore Th1/Th2 imbalance in TB patients."

The accuracy of current tools for the rapid diagnosis of TBM is suboptimal. We sought to develop a clinical-prediction rule for the diagnosis of TBM in a high HIV prevalence setting, and to compare performance outcomes to conventional diagnostic modalities and a novel lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen detection test (Clearview-TB) using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). METHODS: Patients with suspected TBM were classified as definite-TBM (CSF culture or PCR positive), probable-TBM and non-TBM. RESULTS: Of the 150 patients, 84% were HIV-infected (median [IQR] CD4 count = 132 [54; 241] cells/l). There were 39, 55 and 54 patients in the definite, probable and non-TBM groups, respectively. The LAM sensitivity and specificity (95%CI) was 31% (17;48) and 94% (85;99), respectively (cut-point  0.18). By contrast, smear-microscopy was 100% specific but detected none of the definite-TBM cases. LAM positivity was associated with HIV co-infection and low CD4 T cell count (CD4<200 vs. >200 cells/l; p = 0.03). The sensitivity and specificity in those with a CD4<100 cells/l was 50% (27;73) and 95% (74;99), respectively. A clinical-prediction rule  6 derived from multivariate analysis had a sensitivity and specificity (95%CI) of 47% (31;64) and 98% (90;100), respectively. When LAM was combined with the clinical-prediction-rule, the sensitivity increased significantly (p<0.001) to 63% (47;68) and specificity remained high at 93% (82;98). CONCLUSIONS: Despite its modest sensitivity the LAM ELISA is an accurate rapid rule-in test for TBM that has incremental value over smear-microscopy. The rule-in value of LAM can be further increased by combination with a clinical-prediction rule, thus enhancing the rapid diagnosis of TBM in HIV-infected persons with advanced immunosuppression."

METHODS: Albumin in CSF and serum was assayed by IMMAGE. The CSF/serum albumin ratio (QALB) was used to evaluate the permeability of the BCB. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect the amount of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA, and an MTBDRplus reagent kit was used to determine the type of drug resistance of the M. tuberculosis. RESULTS: The correlation analysis showed that significant correlation existed between the grade of severity of tuberculous meningitis and the QALB, and the grade of severity and the total leukocyte count in the CSF, for which the correlation coefficients were 0.366 (p < 0.05) and 0.365 (p < 0.05), respectively. The QALB in the group of patients who recovered was significantly higher than that in those patients who experienced disease progression (p = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the permeability of the BCB correlated with the cure rate in tuberculous meningitis. Specifically, in the treatment of tuberculous meningitis, it is of key importance to utilize the benefit of the permeability of the BCB to achieve a better outcome."

New cases are now mainly caused by the progression of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Thus, methods to diagnose and treat LTBI are urgently needed to prevent the development of active TB in infected individuals and the subsequent spread of the disease. In this study, a systems biology approach was utilized to obtain numerous microarray data sets for mRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of TB patients and individuals with LTBI. Within these data sets, we identified the differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs and further investigated which differentially expressed genes and miRNAs were uniquely expressed during LTBI. The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was employed to analyze the functional annotations and pathway classifications of the identified genes. To further understand the unique miRNA-gene regulatory network of LTBI, we constructed a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network for the targeted genes. The PPI network included 39 genes that were differentially and uniquely expressed in PBMCs of individuals with LTBI, and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that these genes were predominantly involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which plays an important role in chronic inflammation. DIANA TOOLs-mirPath analysis revealed that the identified miRNAs in the miRNA-gene regulatory network for LTBI were mainly associated with the Hippo signaling pathway, which functions in the development of inflammation. Quantitative real-time PCR verified the up expression of hsa-miR-212-3p and its predicted target gene -MAPK1 which had low expression and was a major component of the PPI network, and MAPK1 expression was correlated with the clinicopathological characteristics of LTBI by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Therefore, MAPK1 has potential to be a new investigable marker during LTBI, which merits our further study and solution. The unique aberrant miRNA-gene regulatory network and the related PPI network identified in this study provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of the immune response to LTBI, and thus, may aid in the development of a novel treatment strategy."

T cell receptor (TCR) reflects the status and function of T cells. However, the features of the TCR beta variable (TCRBV) repertoire used against ESAT-6 and CFP-10 from MTB subjects have not been well described. The molecular profiles of TCRBV complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) in PBMCs with or without ESAT-6 or CFP-10 stimulation were assayed using a gene melting spectral pattern (GMSP) assay developed in our previous study. The average number of skewed TCRBV family in PBMCs stimulated with ESAT-6 or CFP-10 was significantly higher than that in unstimulated PBMCs. TCRBV3, BV5.1, BV12, BV13.1, BV13.2, BV20 and BV24 were used more frequently than other TCRBV members in PBMCs from MTB subjects, and TCRBV3, BV5.1 in stimulated PBMCs have a preference in the usage of variable (V) and joining (J) segments and CDR3. The results indicate that the T cell immune response in MTB subjects involves a few of specific T cells. The preferred usage of certain V and J segments and CDR3s of TCRBV3 or BV5.1 may be related to ESAT-6 or CFP-10 respectively, which would help clinical differential diagnosis and treatment of MTB-infected subjects."

The majority of data has been obtained from mouse models, thus the aim of this study was to determine the impact of Flu co-infection on host immunity and disease severity in TB patients at diagnosis. Methods: Sputum from 282 patients with active TB were analyzed for presence of FluA/FluB RNA at presentation using multiplex PCR. Sputum RNA was also analyzed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) load using (16)S RNA amplification. Supernatants from digested sputum and Mtb antigen-stimulated whole blood were analyzed using multiplex cytokine arrays and PBMC were analyzed for cytokine production from CD4+ T, CD8+ T and Mucosal Associated Invariant T cells (MAITs). Results: 12 (4.3%) of TB patients were found to have FluA or FluB viral RNA present in their sputum at the time of TB diagnosis. The TB/Flu co-infected patients had a significantly higher bacterial load compared to those with TB mono-infection (p = 0.0026). They had lower levels of IL17A in ex vivo sputum (p = 0.0275) and higher MCP-1 (CCL2) levels in the blood following PPD stimulation (p = 0.0267). TB/Flu co-infected subjects had significantly higher IFN-+IL-17+CD4+ and IFN-+IL-17-CD8+ cells compared to TB mono-infected subjects. Conclusions: These data show that Flu co-infection at time of TB diagnosis is associated with a higher bacterial load and differential cellular and soluble profiles. These findings show for the first time the impact of TB/Flu co-infection in a human cohort and support the potential benefit of Flu vaccination in TB-endemic settings."

Because filterability is one of the characteristics of L-forms, considerable interest has been shown in their capacity to cross the maternal-fetal barrier. The current study demonstrated isolation of mycobacterial L-form cultures from umbilical cord blood of 5 healthy newborns of healthy mothers vaccinated previously with BCG. The isolated cultures showed distinctive growth characteristics of cell wall deficient L-form bacteria. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated presence of L-bodies with extremely small size of 100nm and revealed morphological transformations, typical for L-forms. IS6110 Real Time PCR assay confirmed that all L-form isolates were of mycobacterial origin and belonged to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex which includes vaccinal BCG substrains. In conclusion, we could suggest that reproductive filterable L-bodies of BCG origin are able to fall in blood circulation of the fetus by vertical transmitted pathway and colonize newborns."

The TSC1 and TSC2 genes have been identified as pathogenic genes. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, we are discussing a novel frameshift mutation and a novel missense mutation in the TSC2 gene. DIAGNOSES: The two cases discussed in this study met the latest diagnostic criteria for TSC published by the International Tuberculosis Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference in 2012. INTERVENTIONS: High-throughput sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) were used to examine tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-related genes (TSC1 and TSC2) and their splicing regions using peripheral blood DNA from two probands in two families with TSC and to identify the genetic mutation sites. Amplification primers were designed for the mutation sites, and polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing were used to verify the peripheral blood DNA sequences from the probands and their parents. OUTCOME: Proband 1 had the c.1228 (exon 12)_c.1229 (exon 12) insG (p.L410RfsX11) heterozygous mutation in the TSC2 gene (chr16), which was a new frameshift mutation. Proband 2 had the c.4925G>A (exon 38) (p.G1642D) heterozygous mutation in the TSC2 gene (chr16), which was a new missense mutation.

However, current methods to estimate TB-related deaths are inadequate and most autopsy studies do not adequately represent those attending primary health clinics (PHCs). This study aimed to determine the autopsy prevalence of TB and other infections in adults enrolled at South African PHCs in the context of a pragmatic trial of empiric TB treatment (""TB Fast Track""). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adults with CD4 150 cells/L, not on ART or TB treatment, were enrolled to TB Fast Track and followed up for at least six months. Minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) was conducted as soon as possible after death. Lungs, liver, and spleen were biopsied; blood, CSF, and urine aspirated; and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained. Samples underwent mycobacterial, bacterial, and fungal culture; molecular testing (including Xpert MTB/RIF); and histological examination. 34 MIAs were conducted: 18 (53%) decedents were female; median age was 39 (interquartile range 33-44) years; 25 (74%) deaths occurred in hospitals; median time from death to MIA was five (IQR 3-6) days. 16/34 (47%) had evidence of TB (14/16 [88%] with extrapulmonary disease; 6/16 [38%] not started on treatment antemortem); 23 (68%) had clinically important bacterial infections; four (12%) cryptococcal disease; three (9%) non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease; and two (6%) Pneumocystis pneumonia. Twenty decedents (59%) had evidence of two or more concurrent infections; 9/16 (56%) individuals with TB had evidence of bacterial disease and two (13%) cryptococcal disease. CONCLUSIONS: TB, followed by bacterial infections, were the leading findings at autopsy among adults with advanced HIV enrolled from primary care clinics. To reduce mortality, strategies are needed to identify and direct those at highest risk into a structured pathway that includes expedited investigation and/or treatment of TB and other infections."

Three different strategies were used for generating the constructs expressing the recombinant fusion M. tuberculosis proteins with luciferase: synthetic gene synthesis, Gateway recombination cloning, and custom PCR synthesis. A pilot cohort of African pulmonary TB patients was used for initial antibody screening and confirmatory studies with selected antigens were performed with a cohort from Thailand and healthy US blood donors. In addition to testing M. tuberculosis antigens separately, a mixture that tested seven antigens simultaneously was evaluated for diagnostic performance. RESULTS: LIPS testing of a pilot set of serum samples from African pulmonary TB patients identified a potential subset of diagnostically useful M. tuberculosis antigens. Evaluation of a second independent cohort from Thailand validated highly significant antibody responses against seven antigens (PstS1, Rv0831c, FbpA, EspB, bfrB, HspX and ssb), which often showed robust antibody levels up to 50- to 1000-fold higher than local community controls. Marked heterogeneity of antibody responses was observed in the patients and the combined results demonstrated 73.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detection of pulmonary TB. A LIPS test simultaneously employing the seven M. tuberculosis antigen as a mixture matched the combined diagnostic performance of the separate tests, but showed an even higher diagnostic sensitivity (90%) when a cut-off based on healthy US blood donors was used. CONCLUSION: A LIPS immunoassay employing multiple M. tuberculosis antigens shows promise for the rapid and quantitative serological detection of pulmonary TB."

In the present study, an 82-kDa protein antigen was isolated by affinity chromatography and was identified by peptide mass fingerprinting as isocitrate dehydrogenase II, which is encoded by the icd2 gene of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The icd2 gene of BCG was cloned by PCR, and the product of recombinant gene expression was purified and analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant protein, named rICD2, was tested for its recognition by immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from the sera of 16 patients with tuberculosis (TB) and 23 healthy individuals by Western blotting. The results showed that rICD2 is recognized by IgG antibodies from the sera of all TB patients tested at serum dilutions of > or = 1:640. At a serum dilution of 1:1,280, the sensitivity was 50% and the specificity was 86.9%. These results indicate that rICD2 might represent a candidate for use in a new assay for the serodiagnosis of TB."

Here we describe a comprehensive multi-center comparison of the most commonly used protocols for cytokine analysis: ELISA, ELISPOT and RT-PCR, in cohorts of TB patients, their household contacts and community controls. In particular, we have studied the effect on these protocols of conditions that commonly prevail in field studies, such as delays between sample collection and analysis, or different source material, such as whole blood or frozen PBMC. The results clearly show that while there is good correlation between the methods under optimal conditions, each method has strengths and weaknesses that render them more or less suitable for particular types of analyses.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed cerebrospinal fluid real time PCR and serological testing for Toxoplasma gondii in archived samples from a well-characterized cohort of 64 HIV-infected patients presenting with subacute meningitis in a referral hospital in Indonesia. Neuroradiology was only available for 6 patients. At time of presentation, patients mostly had newly diagnosed and advanced HIV infection (median CD4 count 22 cells/mL), with only 17.2% taking ART, and 9.4% PJP-prophylaxis. CSF PCR for T. Gondii was positive in 21 patients (32.8%). Circulating toxoplasma IgG was present in 77.2% of patients tested, including all in whom the PCR of CSF was positive for T. Gondii. Clinically, in the absence of neuroradiology, toxoplasmosis was difficult to distinguish from tuberculosis or cryptococcal meningitis, although CSF abnormalities were less pronounced. Mortality among patients with a positive CSF T. Gondii PCR was 81%, 2.16-fold higher (95% CI 1.04-4.47) compared to those with a negative PCR.

METHODS: The mRNA and protein expression levels of MRP8 or MRP14 were measured by real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Role of MRP8/14 was tested by overexpression or RNA interference assays. Flow cytometry and colony forming unit were used to test the phagocytosis and the survival of intracellular Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG), respectively. Autophagy mediated by MRP8/14 was detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence. The colocalization of BCG phagosomes with autophagosomes or lysosomes was by detected by confocal microscopy. ROS production was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: MRP8/14 expressions were up-regulated in human monocytic THP1 cells and primary macrophages after mycobacterial challenge. Silencing of MRP8/14 suppressed bacterial killing, but had no influence on the phagocytosis of BCG. Importantly, silencing MRP8/14 decreased autophagy and BCG phagosome maturation in THP1-derived macrophages, thereby increasing the BCG survival. Additionally, we demonstrated that MRP8/14 promoted autophagy in a ROS-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed a novel role of MRP8/14 in the autophagy-mediated elimination of intracellular BCG by promoting ROS generation, which may provide a promising therapeutic target for tuberculosis and other intracellular bacterial infectious diseases."

Latent yaws represents a diagnostic challenge, and current tools cannot adequately distinguish between individuals with true latent infection and individuals who are serofast following successful treatment. PCR on blood has previously been shown to detect T. pallidum DNA in patients with syphilis, suggesting that this approach may be of value in yaws. We performed real-time PCR for Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue on blood samples from 140 children with positive T. pallidum Particle Agglutination (TPPA) and Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) tests and 7 controls (negative serology), all collected as part of a prospective study of yaws in the Solomon Islands. All samples were also tested by a nested PCR for T. pallidum. 12 patients had clinical evidence of active yaws whilst 128 were considered to have latent yaws. 43 children had high titre rapid plasma reagins (RPRs) of 1:32. PCR testing with both assays gave negative results in all cases. It is possible that the failure to detect T. pallidum ssp. pertenue in blood reflects lower loads of organism in latent yaws compared to those in latent infection with T. pallidum ssp. pertenue, and/or a lower propensity for haematogenous dissemination in yaws than in syphilis. As the goal of the yaws control programme is eradication, a tool that can differentiate true latent infection from individuals who are serofast would be of value; however, PCR of blood is not that tool."

A simple, reproducible and definitive diagnostic procedure is therefore indispensable for the early and accurate detection of parasites in VL, Relapsed VL (RVL) and Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) patients, all of whom are potential reservoirs of Leishmania parasites. To overcome the limitations of current diagnostic approaches, a novel quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method based on Taqman chemistry was devised for the detection and quantification of L. donovani in blood and skin. The diagnostic efficacy was evaluated using archived peripheral blood buffy coat DNA from 40 VL, 40 PKDL, 10 RVL, 20 cured VL, and 40 cured PKDL along with 10 tuberculosis (TB) cases and 80 healthy endemic controls. Results were compared to those obtained using a Leishmania-specific nested PCR (Ln-PCR). The real time PCR assay was 100% (95% CI, 91.19-100%) sensitive in detecting parasite genomes in VL and RVL samples and 85.0% (95% CI, 70.16-94.29%) sensitive for PKDL samples. In contrast, the sensitivity of Ln-PCR was 77.5% (95% CI, 61.55-89.16%) for VL samples, 100% (95%CI, 69.15-100%) for RVL samples, and 52.5% (95% CI, 36.13-68.49%) for PKDL samples. There was significant discordance between the two methods with the overall sensitivity of the qPCR assay being considerably higher than Ln-PCR. None of the assay detected L. donovani DNA in buffy coats from cured VL cases, and reduced infectious burdens were demonstrated in cured PKDL cases who remained positive in 7.5% (3/40) and 2.5% (1/40) cases by real-time PCR and Ln-PCR, respectively. Both assays were 100% (95% CI, 95.98-100) specific with no positive signals in either endemic healthy control or TB samples. The real time PCR assay we developed offers a molecular tool for accurate detection of circulating L. donovani parasites in VL, PKDL and RVL patients, as well as being capable of assessing response to treatment. As such, this real time PCR assay represents an important contribution in efforts to eliminate VL."

Because of its special growth requirements (it grows at 30-32 degrees C and requires iron-supplemented medium), the organism cannot be isolated using routine culture techniques for other mycobacteria. Only a few developed countries have reported infection with this mycobacterium. We report the first two cases diagnosed in Venezuela. METHODS: The diagnosis of the first case was established using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction endonuclease analysis of the gene encoding the 65-kDa heat shock protein (hsp65) for the direct identification of M. haemophilum in a clinical specimen in which bacilli were observed on acid-fast smear, but growth was not detected by standard culture procedures. RESULTS: After recognizing this bacterium as a possible cause of infection in our setting, clinical samples of cutaneous lesions were routinely cultured on blood agar at 30 degrees C for at least 6 weeks, which resulted in the diagnosis of the second case. CONCLUSIONS: Dermatologists should consider this bacterium in immunocompromised patients with cutaneous ulcerating lesions. Material from the lesions can be screened for mycobacteria using an acid-fast stain and, if acid-fast bacilli are seen, PCR analysis of mycobacterial hsp65 can be an effective tool for early diagnosis. Appropriate culture methods are required for bacteriologic confirmation of infection with M. haemophilum."

Thus, the CD1-reactive TCR repertoire is composed of at least two compartments: high-affinity GEM TCRs, and more-diverse TCRs with low affinity for CD1b-lipid complexes. We found high interdonor conservation of TCRs that probably resulted from selection by a nonpolymorphic antigen-presenting molecule and an immunodominant antigen."

RESULTS: Xpert HIV-1VL demonstrated 100% concordance with predicate platforms on a standardised frozen, plasma panel (n = 42) and low overall percentage similarity CV of 1.5% and 0.9% compared to Taqmanv2 and Abbott HIV-1 RT, respectively. On paired plasma clinical specimens, Xpert HIV-1VL had low bias (SD 0.32-0.37logcp/ml) and 3% misclassification at the 1000cp/ml threshold compared to Taqmanv2 (fresh) and Abbott HIV-1 RT (frozen), respectively. Xpert HIV-1VL on whole blood and DBS increased misclassification (upward) by up to 14% with increased invalid rate. All specimen testing was easy to perform and compatible with concurrent Xpert MTB/RIF Tuberculosis testing on the same instrument. CONCLUSION: The Xpert HIV-1VL on plasma can be used interchangeably with existing predicate platforms in South Africa. Whole blood and DBS testing requires further investigation, but polyvalency of the GeneXpert offers a solution to extending VL testing services."

The occurrence of BOOP in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients has rarely been described, and there have been no clinical case reports in Korea. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old female who had been diagnosed with HIV ten years prior was admitted due to a 1-year history of cough and sputum production and a 3-day history of fever. She had poor adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) due to gastrointestinal troubles. At the time of admission, her CD4 T-cell count was 5 cells/mm(3). A high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan showed tiny centrilobular nodules with a tree-in-bud pattern in both lungs. Bacterial culture, Pneumocystis jirovecii polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Aspergillus galactomannan antigen (Ag) assay, and respiratory virus PCR were negative. Rapid chest x-ray improvement was seen after a 7-day treatment with anti-tuberculosis medication, ceftriaxone, and clarithromycin. Miliary tuberculosis seemed unlikely considering the rapid radiologic improvement and negative tuberculosis PCR results. Due to the unknown etiology, we performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to determine the cause of the diffuse lung infiltration. Pathologic findings were consistent with BOOP, while tissue acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain and tuberculosis PCR results were negative. Tuberculosis medication and intravenous ceftriaxone were discontinued, while treatment with clarithromycin monotherapy was sustained. Five months after discharge, the patient was asymptomatic with a normal chest x-ray and as her adherence to ART improved, her CD4 T-cell count rose to 181 cells/mm(3). Clarithromycin was discontinued at that time and the patient is currently receiving regular outpatient follow-up. CONCLUSION: This case suggests that macrolides are a potential treatment option in HIV-infected patients with mild BOOP. In cases that are otherwise unexplained or unresponsive to treatment, BOOP should be taken into consideration and surgical biopsy performed to confirm a diagnosis of BOOP."

However, the effects of BCG vaccination over time on the T helper subpopulation and the microRNAs involved in adulthood have not been studied. In the present study, we explored the involvement of microRNAs, transcription factors and multifunctional cytokines in BCG vaccination by examining their levels both before and after vaccination of healthy adults. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained at 0, 2 and 6 months after vaccination. Cells were cultured in the presence or absence of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 or M. tuberculosis filtrate. The expression levels of miRNAs and transcription factors were evaluated using qRT-PCR. Cytokine production in supernatants and serum samples was evaluated using ELISA. Multifunctional CD4+ T cells were analyzed using multiparametric flow cytometry. We observed a decrease in the expression levels of T-BET, GATA3 and FOXP3 at 2 months and miR-146a, miR-326 and miR-155 at 6 months after receiving the vaccine. In the supernatant, the production of IL-17 was increased after 6 months, with both stimuli. In contrast, IL-10, TNF- and IFN- increased at 2 months. In the serum, high levels of IL-10 were found after 2 months compared to time 0 and 6 months. The production of multifunctional cells that expressed the cytokine profiles CD4+TNF-+IFN--IL-10-, CD4+TNF-+IL-1IFN--, CD4+IL-10+IFN--TNF-- and CD4+IL-17+IFN-- predominantly increased after 2 months with and without the stimulus. Correlation analysis revealed a negative association between FOXP3 and miR-155 (r=-0.5120, p=0.0176) and between IL-17 and miR-326 (r=-0.5832, p=0.0364). This study is the first to demonstrate roles for microRNAs, transcription factors and cytokines in the T helper differentiation lineage and to describe the possible mechanism by which their expression is modulated by the presence of the BCG vaccine in adulthood. In conclusion, our results suggest that the BCG vaccine induces a modulation in transcription factors and miRNAs with high production of multifunctional cells CD4+TNF-+IL-10+IFN--."

TLR-induced secretion of IL-27 was significantly reduced in the NDD group compared to the control (Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT)) and KDM groups. On the other hand, the expression of CD80 was significantly upregulated in both the monocytes and B cells in KDM group. This was associated with increased T cell activation (CD3+CD69+HLA-DR+) with increased IL-17 and reduced TNF- secretion in this group. Impaired TLR-induced IL-27 secretion and augmented expression of antigen presentation molecules result in chronic T cell activation which may fuel T cell-mediated inflammation in type-2 diabetes."

In addition, there is a lack of accurate diagnostic indices with which to evaluate the activity of the disease. The aim of this study was to identify UC-associated proteins as biomarkers for the diagnosis, and objective assessment of disease activity. METHODS: Differential expression of serum proteins from UC patients compared to normal controls was analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The expression of heat shock factor 2(HSF2)in colonic mucosa in Crohn's disease, Behcet's disease, ulcerative colitis, intestinal tuberculosis, infective enteritis, intestinal lymphoma, and normal controls was investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The expression of the HSF2 in colonic mucosa of UC subjects with varying severity of disease was measured by real time-PCR and Western Blots. The expression of HSF2 was inhibited by HSF2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection in Caco-2 cells. The concentrations of HSF2, IL-1, and TNF- in serum and IL-1, and TNF- in the supernatants of transfected Caco-2 cells were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: HSF2 was differentially expressed in UC patients compared to normal controls. HSF2 expression was significantly higher in the intestinal mucosa of UC patients compared to other six groups. The results of immunohistochemistry, real time-PCR, Western Blots, and ELISA showed that the expression of HSF2 increased in parallel with the severity of UC. The serum concentration of HSF2 also positively correlated with levels of IL-1 and TNF-. After down-regulation expression of HSF2 in Caco-2 cells by RNA interference, the productions of IL-1 and TNF- stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased dramatically. CONCLUSIONS: HSF2 appears to be a potential novel molecular marker for UC activity, and may provide a basis for studies on the pathogenesis and novel therapeutic targets for UC."

The reactions of the cytotoxic and helper T lymphocyte subsets after BCG vaccination were analyzed by cytofluorometry and in functional tests. The relative number of CD8(+) T cells in the spleen increased substantially after injection of BCG. In vitro restimulation after immunization induced a strong proliferative response but no cytotoxic reactions of CD8(+) T cells against BCG-infected macrophages. A specific induction of IFN-gamma and RANTES mRNA was observed after vaccination particularly in CD8(+) but not in CD4(+) T cells of the lymph nodes.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and T cell lines from old and young healthy individuals were therefore analyzed for their production of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin 4 (IL-4). Tetanus toxoid (TT), purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, inactivated influenza virus and OKT-3 were used as stimuli. RT-PCR and ELISA determinations were performed. When stimulated with TT, PBMC from young and old individuals expressed IL-4, but produced little IFN-gamma. All other stimuli induced a pronounced IFN-gamma production, while little or no IL-4 was expressed. T cell lines, regardless of their specificity or the donor age, produced IFN-gamma and IL-4. The quantities of cytokines produced did not significantly differ between the age groups. The capacity of the immune system to trigger type 1 and type 2 T cell responses is thus well preserved in old age."

Spoligotyping and MIRU/VNTR-typing performed to assess the genetic similarity revealed identical molecular characteristics of the isolates from all animals involved. Anti-tuberculosis antibodies were detected using ELISA and a recently developed serological rapid test. The study shows that: (i) using molecular methods, the assessment of the genetic relationship of infectious agents helps to confirm the routes of infection, and that (ii) immunological tests may help to detect tuberculosis infections ante mortem more reliably and early. This would prevent the transfer of tuberculosis by asymptomatic animals."

DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: Anti-retroviral Therapy (ART) Centers/ Integrated Counseling and Testing Centers (ICTC) at four government Obstetrics Institutes in an urban area. PARTICIPANTS: 100 HIV-positive pregnant women and their infants delivered in the study centers. METHODS: Triple drug ART to HIV-positive pregnant women was started for maternal indications only. Rest of the pregnant women were given single dose Nevirapine (200 mg) at the onset of labor. All infants were given single dose Nevirapine (2 mg/kg) prophylaxis, according to National AIDS Control Organization guidelines. Mothers were counseled regarding breastfeeding and artificial feeding, and the choice was left to them. Whole blood HIV 1 DNA PCR was done for all infants at 6 weeks of life. A second PCR was done at 6 months or 6 weeks after stopping breastfeeds. PCR-positive infants were started on ART, and were followed-up till18 months of life. RESULTS: Four infants were PCR-positive for HIV. All of them were breastfed. They were born to mothers of HIV stage 1 or 2 who were not on ART as CD4 counts were >350 cells/mm3. Among the mothers in Stage 3 or 4 or CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 and on ART, none of the infants was HIV-positive. The cumulative HIV-free survival at 18 months was 94%. CONCLUSIONS: Parent-to-child transmission rate in HIV was low with the currently used strategies. Triple drug ART to mother reduces mother-to-child transmission despite advanced maternal stage or low CD4 counts."

In a preliminary evaluation, we compared the results of mPCR/RLB with those of single (uniplex) PCRs and culture of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 100 children under 5 years, admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital between October 2004 and May 2005, with pneumonia. RESULTS: Reference strains and clinical isolates of all 12 target species were correctly identified by mPCR/RLB. Potential pathogens were isolated from one blood culture and 26% of respiratory cultures. One or more pathogens were identified in 70% of respiratory specimens--by mPCR/RLB in 63%, uPCR only in another 3%, culture only in 2%, and culture plus uPCR in 2%. The species most commonly identified were S. pneumoniae (54%) and H. influenzae (38%, including type b, 4%). Cultures were not performed for B. pertussis, M. tuberculosis, C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae but each was identified by mPCR/RLB in between one and four specimens. Two or more potential pathogens were identified in 35% of specimens. Ten of 14 S. pneumoniae isolates belonged to serotypes represented in the 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The mPCR/RLB assay is a sensitive tool for identification of respiratory pathogens, including mixed infections and bacteria requiring special culture methods."

In addition, the utility of an internal control in monitoring amplification inhibitors was studied. Of 545 respiratory and 325 nonrespiratory specimens (a total of 870 specimens), 58 (6.7%) showed the presence of amplification inhibitors, as determined by a negative result for the internal control. Of these 58 specimens, 31 (53%) were stool specimens; other material, even citrate blood after lysis of erythrocytes, did not pose a problem with regard to inhibition of PCR amplification. Eighty-one of the remaining 812 specimens had a positive Mycobacterium culture result. Of these culture-positive specimens, 58 (71.6%) showed a positive result with the Mycobacterium genus-specific probe. Seventy-two samples had a positive result with the Mycobacterium-specific probe but a negative culture result. Of these 72 samples, 26 samples were regarded as true positive, either because the M. tuberculosis- or M. avium-specific probe was also positive at the same time or because other specimens from the same patient taken at the same time were culture positive. The sensitivity of the Mycobacterium-specific probe was 78.5% and the specificity was 93.5%. This study showed that pretesting of clinical specimens for mycobacteria to the genus level with a Mycobacterium-specific probe offers the routine clinical laboratory the possibility of detecting tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria with one test. Furthermore, specimens testing positive with the genus-specific probe can be immediately identified with species-specific probes."

Co-infections in immunocompetent patients are not frequently proved with traditional serologic-diagnostic tools. METHODS: Descriptive transversal study, in a Uveitis Service of an Ophthalmology Reference Center, in Bogot, Colombia, from July 2014 to February 2016. Aqueous humor (AH) and/or vitreous fluid, blood and serum samples were collected from consecutive patients suspected of having infectious uveitis. The diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT) was confirmed by the Goldmann-Witmer coefficient (GWC) and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Differential diagnosis by PCR in AH was done for viral origin such as Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV2), Varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. RESULTS: In 66 Colombian patients with uveitis of presumed infectious origin: 22 (33.3%) were confirmed as OT, 16 (24.2%) as undetermined OT, five (7.5%) as co-infections and 23 (34.8%) as other uveitis. Toxoplasma coinfection with M. tuberculosis was identified in one case by PCR and in four cases with HSV by GWC. The initial clinical diagnosis changed, after laboratory examination, in 21 cases (31.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical diagnosis can be changed by laboratory examination in a significant proportion of cases of uveitis. Diagnosis of OT should combine the use of PCR and GWC to reach the maximum of confirmation of cases. The use of multiple laboratory methods is necessary to identify co-infections and viral infections that can mimic OT in immunocompetent patients."

The study enrolled 334 patients with newly diagnosed infiltrative and disseminated PTB. Cultivation of mDCs was performed from non-proliferating progenitors of CD14(+) blood monocytes. Cytokine secretion was evaluated by measuring cytokine concentration in the mDC culture supernatants using enzyme-linked immunosorbent essay (ELISA). To study cytokine gene polymorphisms, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLP) were performed. Reduced secretion of IL-18 and IL-27 by mDCs in PTB patients was associated with 105A/C polymorphisms of the IL18 gene, and 2905T/G, 4730T/, and -964A/G of the IL27 gene, respectively. Polymorphism IL12B/insertion had a bidirectional influence on the secretion of IL-12p70, being associated with decreased levels of the cytokine in infiltrative PTB and increased levels in disseminated PTB patients."

JD has a high herd prevalence and causes serious animal health problems and significant economic loss in domesticated ruminants throughout the world. Since serological detection of MAP infected animals during the early stages of infection remains challenging due to the low sensitivity of extant assays, we screened 180 well-characterized serum samples using a whole proteome microarray from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), a close relative of MAP. Based on extensive testing of serum and milk samples, fecal culture and qPCR for direct detection of MAP, the samples were previously assigned to one of 4 groups: negative low exposure (n = 30, NL); negative high exposure (n = 30, NH); fecal positive, ELISA negative (n = 60, F+E-); and fecal positive, ELISA positive (n = 60, F+E+). Of the 740 reactive proteins, several antigens were serologically recognized early but not late in infection, suggesting a complex and dynamic evolution of the MAP humoral immune response during disease progression. Ordinal logistic regression models identified a subset of 47 candidate proteins with significantly different normalized intensity values (p<0.05), including 12 in the NH and 23 in F+E- groups, suggesting potential utility for the early detection of MAP infected animals. Next, the diagnostic utility of four MAP orthologs (MAP1569, MAP2942c, MAP2609, and MAP1272c) was assessed and reveal moderate to high diagnostic sensitivities (range 48.3% to 76.7%) and specificity (range 96.7% to 100%), with a combined 88.3% sensitivity and 96.7% specificity. Taken together, the results of our analyses have identified several candidate MAP proteins of potential utility for the early detection of MAP infection, as well individual MAP proteins that may serve as the foundation for the next generation of well-defined serological diagnosis of JD in cattle."

The immunomodulatory protein, lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) decreases Th1-type immune responses in T-cells. LAG-3 expression is significantly induced in the lungs of macaques with active TB and correlates with increased bacterial burden. Overproduction of LAG-3 can greatly diminish responses and could lead to uncontrolled Mtb replication. To assess the effect of LAG-3 on the progression of Mtb infection, we developed a co-culture system wherein blood-derived macrophages are infected with Mtb and supplemented with macaque blood or lung derived CD4+ T-cells. Silencing LAG-3 signaling in macaque lung CD4+ T-cells enhanced killing of Mtb in co-cultures, accompanied by reduced mitochondrial electron transport and increased IFN- expression. Thus, LAG-3 may modulate adaptive immunity to Mtb infection by interfering with the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Better understanding this pathway could allow us to circumvent immune features that promote disease."

Proofreading PCR (PR-PCR) was developed for mutation detection in 1998 but is rarely applied due to its low efficiency in allele discrimination. Here we developed a modified PR-PCR method using a ddNTP-blocked primer and a mixture of DNA polymerases with and without the 3'-5' proofreading function. The ddNTP-blocked primer exhibited the best blocking efficiency to avoid nonspecific primer extension while the mixture of a tiny amount of high-fidelity DNA polymerase with a routine amount of Taq DNA polymerase provided the best discrimination and amplification effects. The modified PR-PCR method is quite capable of detecting various mutation types, including point mutations and insertions/deletions (indels), and allows discrimination amplification when the mismatch is located within the last eight nucleotides from the 3'-end of the ddNTP-blocked primer. The modified PR-PCR has a sensitivity of 1-5  102 copies and a selectivity of 5  10-5 mutant among 107 copies of wild-type DNA. It showed a 100% accuracy rate in the detection of P72R germ-line mutation in the TP53 gene among 60 clinical blood samples, and a high potential to detect rifampin-resistant mutations at low frequency in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using an adaptor and a fusion-blocked primer. These results suggest that the modified PR-PCR technique is effective in detection of various mutations or polymorphisms as a simple, sensitive and promising approach."

It was shown that the chitosan-DNA formulation was able to induce the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) while chitosan solution alone could not, indicating the DNA was released from the particles and able to stimulate DCs. Pulmonary administration of the DNA plasmid incorporated in chitosan nanoparticles was shown to induce increased levels of IFN-gamma secretion compared to pulmonary delivery of plasmid in solution or the more frequently used intramuscular immunization route. These results indicate that pulmonary delivery of DNA vaccines against tuberculosis may provide an advantageous delivery route compared to intramuscular immunization, and that increased immunogenicity can be achieved by delivery of this DNA encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles."

Diagnosis of EPTB is challenging in resource-limited settings due to difficulties in obtaining samples, as well as the paucibacillarity of the specimens. Skeletal tuberculosis accounts for 10-35% of EPTB cases, with vertebral osteomyelitis (Pott's disease) representing 50% of the cases. We present two cases of suspected Pott's disease, diagnosed through GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay in urine at a rural Tanzanian hospital. CASE PRESENTATION: Case I A 49-year old male, HIV-1 positive, on co-formulated tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/lamivudine/efavirenz since 2009 and CD4 counts of 205 cells/L (13%). He presented with lower back pain and progressive lower limb weakness for two weeks prior to admission. The physical examination revealed bilateral flaccid paraplegia with reduced reflexes, but otherwise unremarkable findings. A lateral lumbar X-ray showed noticeable reduction of intervertebral space between L4 and L5, and a small calcification in the anterior longitudinal ligament between L4 and L5, being compatible with focal spondylosis deformans but inconclusive with regard to tuberculous spondylitis. An abdominal ultrasound showed normal kidneys, bladder and prostate gland. The urinalysis and complete blood counts (CBC) were normal. M. Tuberculosis was detected through GeneXpert MTB/RIF in centrifuged urine, with no resistance to rifampicin. Case II A 76-year old female, HIV-1 negative, presented with lower back pain and progressive weakness and numbness of the lower limbs for two months prior to admission. The physical examination revealed paraplegia, but otherwise unremarkable findings. The lumbosacral X-ray findings were compatible with spondylosis deformans of the lumbar spine and possible tuberculous spondylitis in L3-L4. The abdominal and renal ultrasound showed normal kidneys and bladder. The urinalysis and CBC were normal. M. Tuberculosis was detected through GeneXpert MTB/RIF in centrifuged urine, with no resistance to rifampicin. CONCLUSION: We report two cases of suspected tuberculous spondylitis diagnosed through Xpert MTB/RIF in urine samples from a rural Tanzanian hospital. Urine testing using Xpert MTB/RIF reflects disseminated disease and renal involvement, and may offer a feasible additional diagnostic approach for Pott's disease in rural Africa."

The restriction enzyme that could potentially produce the most restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) was determined from all available ISR DNA sequences in GenBank to produce a novel data set of RFLPs for 31 slowly growing Mycobacterium species. Subsequently a GelCompar II database was constructed from RFLPs for 10 enzymes that have been used in the literature to differentiate slowly growing Mycobacterium species. The combination of Sau96I and HaeIII were the best choice of enzymes for differentiating clinically relevant slowly growing Mycobacterium species. A total of 392 specimens were studied by PCR with 195 negative and 197 positive specimens. The ISR-PCR product was digested with HaeIII (previously reported) and Sau96I (new to this study) to obtain a Mycobacterium species identification based on the ISR-RFLPs. The species identification obtained by ISR-RFLP was confirmed by DNA sequencing (isolate numbers are shown in parentheses) for M. avium (3), M. intracellulare (4), M. avium complex (1), M. gordonae (2) and M. tuberculosis (1). The total number of specimens (99) identified were from culture (67), Bactectrade mark 12B culture bottles (11), EDTA blood (3), directly from smear positive specimens (13), tissue (4) and urine (1). Direct species identification was obtained from all 13/13 smear positive specimens.

This method reduces the time taken for Mycobacterium species identification from 8-10 weeks for culture and biochemical identification; to 4-6 weeks for culture and ISR-RFLP; to 2 days for smear-positive specimens by ISR-RFLP. The precise 2 day identification obtained may provide significant advantages in clinical management."

In patients with NSCLC, the levels of plasma miR-34b-3p was correlated with the diameter of tumor (P<0.01). When using one plasma marker to diagnose NSCLC, miR-302a-5p had the highest sensitivity (82.6%) and CEA had the highest specificity (81.6%). While combined two plasma markers, miR-34b-3p+miR-302a-5p had the highest sensitivity (80.2%) and miR-34b-3p+CEA had the highest specificity (81.4%).

Eleven percent were positive for Mtp40 PCR amplification, being diagnosed as having M. tuberculosis, and acid-fast bacilli were observed in 23% by ZN staining. MOTT were isolated from samples taken from 37 primates by culturing; according to the RFLP analysis, three strains were classified as belonging to the MAISS complex (Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare-scrofulaceum-simiae) and eight more, isolated from soil inside the cages, were categorized as environmental contaminants. Mycobacterium spp. were detected in 13 different New World primate species showing that PCR amplification of the Mtp40 gene is a better tool than culture for M. tuberculosis detection in captive animals and that RFLP is a useful technique for MOTT identification."

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of (HAART) on CD4+ T-cell immunity to HCMV in AIDS patients with no past or current HCMV disease. STUDY DESIGN: Seventeen patients were prospectively examined for CD4+ (CD45RO+ and CD45 RA+) T-cell counts (flow cytometry), HIV RNA load (Amplicor HIV test), HCMV leukoDNAemia and HCMV DNA in urine (nested PCR), lymphoproliferative response (LPR) to HCMV, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and purified protein derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPD) by measurement of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation to DNA (ELISA) and cytokine secretion (IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10) by HCMV-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures (ELISA). RESULTS: Fifteen patients responded favorably to HAART (virologically, immunologically, or both). Of these, six patients presented LPR to HCMV at least once during follow-up, whereas most displayed detectable LPRs to PHA. IFN-gamma was detected at least once in supernatants of HCMV-stimulated PBMC cultures from 14 of the 17 patients. All but one patient tested negative for HCMV leukoDNAemia and HCMV DNA in urine, and none developed HCMV disease during the observation period. CONCLUSIONS: Control of HCMV replication and the absence of HCMV disease are not consistently associated with recovery and/or maintenance of LPR to HCMV in AIDS patients under HAART and with no prior HCMV disease. Whether detection of IFN-gamma by PBMCs upon HCMV antigenic stimulation may serve as a surrogate marker for protection against HCMV disease requires further investigation."

Using recombinant guinea pig (rgp) TNF-alpha, the effect of TNF-alpha on lymphocyte activation was examined in unvaccinated and BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs. Splenocytes were stimulated with PPD or ConA, in the presence or absence of rgp TNF-alpha for 96 h. Lymphocyte proliferation was measured using [(3)H]thymidine uptake, and IL-12 p40 and IFN-gamma mRNA were analyzed using real-time PCR. rgpTNF-alpha alone was able to stimulate a significant degree of proliferation in splenocytes. The addition of rgpTNF-alpha to PPD-stimulated cells enhanced the proliferation of splenocytes from BCG-vaccinated guinea pigs. Furthermore, enhancement of proliferation by rgpTNF-alpha was found to be correlated with upregulation of the levels of Type 1 cytokine mRNA (IL-12p40 and IFN-gamma) in splenocyte cultures. This suggests that TNF-alpha plays an important role in the regulation of Type 1 T cell-mediated immune responses in the guinea pig."

MymA (Rv3083), a 55kDaM.tb flavin containing monooxygenase, is involved in modification of mycolic acids during acidic shock following M.tb internalization in macrophage. In this study, we have investigated the role of this cell wall associated protein in activation of macrophages by toll like receptor (TLRs) engagement and subsequent signaling. Our results showed that MymA stimulation of THP1 cells and human monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) lead to upregulation of TLR2 and co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, CD86 and HLA-DR. This upregulation is partially reduced by TLR2 blocking antibodies. The activation of macrophage following MymA stimulation also resulted in release of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF- and IL-12. Moreover, MymA also polarized the immune response towards T(H)1 as shown by an increased IFN- level in the supernatant of stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In consensus with the TLR2 signaling involving MyD88 and NF-B, we also observed several fold increase in mRNA for TLR2, MyD88 and NF-B on MymA induction of THP-1 and MDM by qRT-PCR. The increased production of NF-B following recognition of MymA by TLR2 was further confirmed by HEK-TLR2 reporter cell line colorimetric assay. In conclusion, immunological evaluation revealed that MymA is a TLR2 agonist that upregulates signaling via MyD88 and NF-B in macrophages to stimulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines. The MymA protein should be investigated further for expression in recombinant BCG as a pre-exposure vaccine or as a post-exposure subunit vaccine candidate."

Tissue samples of the aneurysmal abdominal aortic wall from seven patients with chronic Q fever and 15 patients without evidence of Q fever infection were analysed and compared. Chronic Q fever was diagnosed using serology and tissue PCR analysis. Histological sections were stained using haematoxylin and eosin staining, Elastica van Gieson staining and immunohistochemical staining for macrophages (CD68), T lymphocytes (CD3), T lymphocyte subsets (CD4 and CD8) and B lymphocytes (CD20). Samples were scored by one pathologist, blinded for Q fever status, using a standard score form. Seven tissue samples from patients with chronic Q fever and 15 tissue samples from patients without Q fever were collected. Four of seven chronic Q fever samples showed a necrotizing granulomatous response of the vascular wall, which was characterized by necrotic core of the arteriosclerotic plaque (P = 0.005) and a presence of high numbers of macrophages in the adventitia (P = 0.007) distributed in typical palisading formation (P = 0.005) and surrounded by the presence of high numbers of T lymphocytes located diffusely in media and adventitia. Necrotizing granulomas are a histological finding in the C. burnetii-infected aneurysmal abdominal aortic wall. Chronic Q fever should be included in the list of infectious diseases with necrotizing granulomatous response, such as tuberculosis, cat scratch disease and syphilis."

All individuals underwent testing for two sputum smears, culture, Xpert, glycated haemoglobin and fasting blood sugar. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of Xpert by comparing it with TB sputum culture result as a gold standard.RESULTS: Among screened individuals, 483 (20%) were diagnosed with DM and 1153 (49%) with pre-DM; 723 (31%) had no DM. Overall sensitivity of Xpert was 96% (95%CI 95-97) and specificity was 91% (95%CI 89-93). Xpert sensitivity was significantly higher among DM group (98%) than in the 'No DM' (95%; P < 0.01) and pre-DM (96%; P < 0.05) groups.

During early-stage infection, M. bovis-infected cattle shed mycobacteria through nasal secretions, which can be detected via nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments. Little research has focused on immune responses in nested PCR-positive (bTB PCR-P) or nested PCR-negative (bTB PCR-N) M. bovis-infected cattle. Here, we investigated the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), with or without stimulation by purified protein derivative of bovine tuberculin (PPD-B), among bTB PCR-P, bTB PCR-N, and healthy cattle using RNA-Seq. We also explored the potential value of PBMC transcripts as novel biomarkers for diagnosing bTB. Numerous differentially expressed genes were identified following pair-wise comparison of different groups, with or without PPD-B stimulation (adjusted p < 0.05). Compared with healthy cattle, bTB PCR-P, and bTB PCR-N cattle shared 5 significantly dysregulated biological pathways, including Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, Hematopoietic cell lineage, Osteoclast differentiation and HTLV-I infection. Notably, dysregulated biological pathways of bTB PCR-P and bTB PCR-N cattle were associated with cell death and phagocytosis, respectively. Lymphotoxin alpha and interleukin-8 could potentially differentiate M. bovis-infected and healthy cattle upon stimulation with PPD-B, with area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of 0.9991 and 0.9343, respectively. B cell lymphoma 2 and chitinase 3-like 1 might enable differentiation between bTB PCR-P and bTB PCR-N upon stimulation with PPD-B, with AUC values of 0.9100 and 0.8893, respectively. Thus, the PBMC transcriptome revealed the immune responses in M. bovis-infected cattle (bTB PCR-P and bTB PCR-N) and may provide a novel sight in bTB diagnosis."

We investigated the potential of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and corresponding predictive models to diagnose these patients. We enrolled 1,764 subjects, including clinically diagnosed PTB patients, microbiologically confirmed PTB cases, non-TB disease controls, and healthy controls, in three cohorts (screening, selection, and validation). Candidate lncRNAs differentially expressed in blood samples of the PTB and healthy control groups were identified by microarray and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) in the screening cohort. Logistic regression models were developed using lncRNAs and/or electronic health records (EHRs) from clinically diagnosed PTB patients and non-TB disease controls in the selection cohort. These models were evaluated by area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and decision curve analyses, and the optimal model was presented as a Web-based nomogram, which was evaluated in the validation cohort. Three differentially expressed lncRNAs (ENST00000497872, n333737, and n335265) were identified. The optimal model (i.e., nomogram) incorporated these three lncRNAs and six EHRs (age, hemoglobin, weight loss, low-grade fever, calcification detected by computed tomography [CT calcification], and interferon gamma release assay for tuberculosis [TB-IGRA]). The nomogram showed an AUC of 0.89, a sensitivity of 0.86, and a specificity of 0.82 in differentiating clinically diagnosed PTB cases from non-TB disease controls of the validation cohort, which demonstrated better discrimination and clinical net benefit than the EHR model. The nomogram also had a discriminative power (AUC, 0.90; sensitivity, 0.85; specificity, 0.81) in identifying microbiologically confirmed PTB patients. lncRNAs and the user-friendly nomogram could facilitate the early identification of PTB cases among suspected patients with negative M. tuberculosis microbiological evidence."

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the proportion and factors associated with the composite outcome of a long TAT (7weeks; from sample collection to receipt of result by mother) or nonreceipt of result among HIV-exposed babies whose blood samples were collected for PCR at <9months of age under the IHC program, Myanmar (2013-15). METHODS: Cohort study involving record review of routinely collected data. A predictive Poisson regression model with robust variance estimates was fitted for risk factors of long TAT or nonreceipt of result. RESULTS: Blood samples of 1000 babies were collected; among them, long TAT or nonreceipt of results was seen in 690 (69%), and this was more than 50% across all subgroups. Babies with a mother's CD4 count of 100-350 cells/mm(3) at enrollment [adjusted RR (0.95 confidence intervals, CI): 0.8 (0.7, 0.9)] had a 20% lower risk of long TAT or nonreceipt of results when compared with 350 cells/mm(3). Distance between ART center and PCR facility 105km [adjusted RR (0.95 CI): 1.2 (1.1, 1.4)], when compared with <105km, was associated with 20% higher risk of long TAT or nonreceipt of results. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of babies with long TAT or nonreceipt of result by the mother was high. Point-of-care testing for EID may reduce TAT/nonreceipt of results by the mother. Health system, laboratory, and logistic factors such as sample transportation, laboratory procedures, and result dispatching associated with long TAT should be further explored."

METHODS: We performed quantitative multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Pneumocystis jirovecii and common bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens on sputum samples (spontaneous or induced) from a prospective cohort study of HIV-infected inpatients with World Health Organization danger signs and cough. Mycobacterial culture was done on 2 sputum samples, blood cultures, and relevant extrapulmonary samples. RESULTS: We enrolled 284 participants from 2 secondary-level hospitals in Cape Town, South Africa: median CD4 count was 97 cells/L, 64% were women, and 38% were on antiretroviral therapy. One hundred forty-eight had culture-positive tuberculosis, 100 had community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), 26 had P. jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), and 64 had other diagnoses. Probable bacterial infection (>105 copies/mL) was detected in 133 participants; the prevalence was highest in those with CAP (52%). Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the commonest bacterial pathogens detected; atypical bacteria were uncommon. Viruses were detected in 203 participants; the prevalence was highest in those with PJP (85%). Human metapneumovirus was the commonest virus detected. Multiple coinfections were commonly detected. CONCLUSIONS: Sputum multiplex PCR could become a useful diagnostic tool for bacterial respiratory infections in HIV-infected inpatients, but its value is limited as quantitative cutoffs have only been established for a few bacterial pathogens and validation has not been done in this patient population. We found a high prevalence of respiratory viruses, but it is unclear whether these viruses were causing infection as there are no accepted quantitative PCR cutoffs for diagnosing respiratory viral infections."

The progression and timing from asymptomatic infection to cryptococcal meningitis is unclear. We describe a subpopulation of individuals with neurologic symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia but negative cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) studies. METHODS: We evaluated 1201 human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive individuals hospitalized with suspected meningitis in Kampala and Mbarara, Uganda. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of participants with neurologic-symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia and negative CSF cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) were compared to participants with confirmed CSF CrAg+ cryptococcal meningitis. Additional CSF testing included microscopy, fungal culture, bacterial culture, tuberculosis culture, multiplex FilmArray polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Biofire), and Xpert MTB/Rif. RESULTS: We found 56% (671/1201) of participants had confirmed CSF CrAg+ cryptococcal meningitis and 4% (54/1201) had neurologic symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia with negative CSF CrAg. Of those with negative CSF CrAg, 9% (5/54) had Cryptococcus isolated on CSF culture (n = 3) or PCR (n = 2) and 11% (6/54) had confirmed tuberculous meningitis. CSF CrAg-negative patients had lower proportions with CSF pleocytosis (16% vs 26% with 5 white cells/L) and CSF opening pressure >200 mmH2O (16% vs 71%) compared with CSF CrAg-positive patients. No cases of bacterial or viral meningitis were detected by CSF PCR or culture. In-hospital mortality was similar between symptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia (32%) and cryptococcal meningitis (31%; P = .91). CONCLUSIONS: Cryptococcal antigenemia with meningitis symptoms was the third most common meningitis etiology. We postulate this is early cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. Fluconazole monotherapy was suboptimal despite Cryptococcus-negative CSF. Further studies are warranted to understand the clinical course and optimal management of this distinct entity.

In the majority of TB endemic settings, sputum smear microscopy is used to diagnose TB, but this test is insensitive for TB in its early stages. The objective of this study is to establish a concise gene signature that discriminates between individuals with early TB disease, latent TB infection (LTBI) and those without infection. METHODS: This is a case control study nested within a cluster-randomised trial of population screening for active TB using Xpert MTB/RIF. Whole blood samples from 303 participants with active TB (97), LTBI (92) and uninfected individuals (114) were subject to transcriptomic analysis of selected target genes based on a systematic review of previous studies. RESULTS: Analysis of 82 genes identified a pattern of differentially expressed genes in TB disease. A seven gene signature was identified that distinguished between TB disease and no TB disease with an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91), and between TB disease from LTBI with an AUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82-0.93). CONCLUSION: This gene signature accurately distinguishes early TB disease from those without TB disease or infection, in the context of community-wide TB screening. It could be used as a non-sputum based screening tool or triage test to detect prevalent cases of TB in the community."

Blood and urine samples from healthy donors spiked with cfDNA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and samples from tuberculosis patients were used to evaluate the impact of blood collection tube, urine preservative, processing delay, processing method, freezing and thawing, and sample volume on pcfDNA. The PCR cycle threshold (C(T) ) was used to measure amplifiable cfDNA. In spiked samples, the median C(T) values for M. tuberculosis, S. enterica, and EBV cfDNA were significantly lower in blood collected in K(2)EDTA tubes than those in Streck and PAXgene blood collection tubes, and they were was significantly lower in urine preserved with EDTA (EDTA-urine) than in urine preserved with Streck reagent (Streck-urine). Blood and urine samples from TB patients preserved with K(2)EDTA and Tris-EDTA, respectively, showed significantly lower median M. tuberculosis C(T) values than with the Streck blood collection tube and Streck urine preservative. Processing delay increased the median pathogen C(T) values for Streck and PAXgene but not K(2)EDTA blood samples and for urine preserved with Streck reagent but not EDTA. Double-spin compared with single-spin plasma separation increased the median pathogen C(T) regardless of blood collection tube. No differences were observed between whole urine and supernatant and between fresh and thawed plasma and urine after 24weeks at -80C. Larger plasma and urine volumes in contrived and patient samples showed a significantly lower median M. tuberculosis C(T) These findings suggest that large-volume single-spin K(2)EDTA-plasma and EDTA-whole urine with up to a 24-h processing delay may optimize pcfDNA detection."

A recombinant hsp70 protein expression vector in methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, was developed that fused the major antigenic segment of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) E protein to the amino terminus of Mycobacterium tuberculosis hsp70. The C-terminal peptide binding domain of hsp70 stimulated Th1-polarizing cytokines, CC chemokines and an adjuvant effect. However, the N-terminal ATPase domain (hsp70 1-358) failed to stimulate any of these cytokines or chemokines. Based on these data, a vector was constructed that permits the fusion of major antigenic segment of E protein to the amino terminus of peptide binding domain of hsp70. Antibody titers, lymphocytes proliferation, the level of mIL-2 or mIFN-gamma and neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice showed that antigenicity of E-binding domain fusion protein was almost as effective as E-hsp70 fusion protein and more effective than carrier protein hsp70 alone. In eliciting a humoral and cellular immune response, both fusion proteins were more powerful than the major antigenic segment of E protein alone, but less effective than the segment administered with Freund's adjuvant."

The present study was designed to demonstrate the diagnostic usefulness of a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, specific for the IS6110 insertion element of M. tuberculosis complex, in patients with ascites who were suspected of having TP in order to achieve a more timely diagnosis and treatment. Methods: Three HIV-negative patients suffering from fever and ascites were evaluated for suspected TP. Specimens were obtained from ascitic fluid, bone marrow, and peripheral blood and analyzed by both conventional methods and nested PCR for the presence of bacilli. Response to antituberculous treatment was considered as the final criterion for diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis. Results: All three patients had an excellent response to antituberculous therapy. Our PCR-based protocol detected M. tuberculosis complex DNA in the ascitic fluid of all patients, whereas conventional methods failed to establish the disease. Furthermore, in one patient, M. tuberculosis was also detected in both bone marrow and peripheral blood. Conclusions: PCR amplification of the IS6110 sequence of M. tuberculosis complex in ascitic fluid is a useful tool when peritoneal tuberculosis is suspected. However, its validity still needs to be established."
Boyles TH and Lynen L and Seddon JA,Wellcome open research,2020,NA,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15611.1,NA,32964134,NA,NA,Tuberculosis Meningitis Diagnosis Threshold Decision,Journal Article and Review,Decision-making in the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis.,0,"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most devastating form of tuberculosis (TB) but diagnosis is difficult and delays in initiating therapy increase mortality. All currently available tests are imperfect; culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is considered the most accurate test but is often negative, even when disease is present, and takes too long to be useful for immediate decision making. Rapid tests that are frequently used are conventional Ziehl-Neelsen staining and nucleic acid amplification tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF and Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra. While positive results will often confirm the diagnosis, negative tests frequently provide insufficient evidence to withhold therapy. The conventional diagnostic approach is to determine the probability of TBM using experience and intuition, based on prevalence of TB, history, examination, analysis of basic blood and CSF parameters, imaging, and rapid test results. Treatment decisions may therefore be both variable and inaccurate, depend on the experience of the clinician, and requests for tests may be inappropriate. In this article we discuss the use of Bayes' theorem and the threshold model of decision making as ways to improve testing and treatment decisions in TBM. Bayes' theorem describes the process of converting the pre-test probability of disease to the post-test probability based on test results and the threshold model guides clinicians to make rational test and treatment decisions. We discuss the advantages and limitations of using these methods and suggest that new diagnostic strategies should ultimately be tested in randomised trials."

Its synthetic analog trehalose-6,6-dibehenate (TDB) is a new adjuvant currently in phase I clinical trials. In rodents, the C-type lectin receptors Mincle and Mcl bind TDB/TDM and activate macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) through the Syk-Card9 pathway. However, it is unknown whether these glycolipids activate human innate immune cells through the same mechanism. We performed in vitro analysis of TDB/TDM-stimulated primary human monocytes, macrophages, and DC; determined C-type lectin receptor expression; and tested the contribution of SYK, MINCLE, and MCL by small interfering RNA knockdown and genetic complementation. We observed a robust chemokine and cytokine release in response to TDB or TDM. MCSF-driven macrophages secreted higher levels of IL-8, IL-6, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL2 after stimulation with TDM, whereas DC responded more strongly to TDB and GM-CSF-driven macrophages were equally responsive to TDB and TDM. SYK kinase and the adaptor protein CARD9 were essential for glycolipid-induced IL-8 production. mRNA expression of MINCLE and MCL was high in monocytes and macrophages, with MINCLE and MCL proteins localized intracellularly under resting conditions. Small interfering RNA-mediated MINCLE or MCL knockdown caused on average reduced TDB- or TDM-induced IL-8 production. Conversely, retroviral expression in murine Mincle-deficient DC revealed that human MINCLE, but not MCL, was sufficient to confer responsiveness to TDB/TDM. Our study demonstrates that SYK-CARD9 signaling plays a key role in TDB/TDM-induced activation of innate immune cells in man as in mouse, likely by engagement of MINCLE."

TB diagnosis is often delayed due to non-specific symptoms, frequent extra-pulmonary manifestations, and rare microbiological confirmation. This case report illustrates the clear added value of combined interferon- -release assays (IGRA) in response to different mycobacterial antigens for an early diagnosis of TB in HD patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of an Egyptian patient under chronic HD treatment, who presented with recurrent episodes of fever and myalgia of unknown origin, associated with an important inflammatory syndrome. These episodes resolved partially or completely within less than 1 month without any treatment but recurred 10 times within 3years. Chest Computed Tomography and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (18FDG PET-CT) demonstrated several active mediastinal lymphadenopathies. TB was the first suspected diagnosis but cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) remained negative on a mediastinal lymph node aspiration. In contrast, the results from two different IGRA performed on blood were highly suggestive of TB disease. Several granulomas, some of them with central non-caseating necrosis, were demonstrated on a pulmonary nodule obtained by thoracoscopic resection, but PCR and culture remained negative for M. tuberculosis. Three years after the initial symptoms, a new PET-CT revealed a retro-clavicular lymphadenopathy in addition to the mediastinal lymphadenopathies, and the M. tuberculosis culture performed on the resected lymphadenopathy was positive. Antibiotic treatment for TB was started and resulted in a clear improvement of the patient's clinical condition, allowing him to successfully receive a renal graft. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the high frequency of TB in patients undergoing chronic HD and of the limitations of the classical diagnosis procedures, nephrologists have to diagnose TB mostly on clinical suspicion. We demonstrate here that the use of a combined IGRA to two different mycobacterial antigens may significantly raise the index of suspicion and help clinicians to decide starting anti-TB treatment in HD patients."

This is the first case report of Mycobacterium simiae infection in Sri Lanka and only very few cases with extrapulmonary manifestation reported in the literature. CASE PRESENTATION: A 24-year-old, previously healthy Sri Lankan male presented with generalized lymphadenopathy with discharging sinuses, evening pyrexia, weight loss, poor appetite and splenomegaly. Lymph node biopsies showed sheets of macrophages packed with organisms in the absence of granulomata. Ziehl Neelsen, Wade Fite and Giemsa stains revealed numerous red coloured acid-fast bacilli within foamy histiocytes. Slit skin smear for leprosy was negative and tuberculosis, fungal and bacterial cultures of the lymph node and bone marrow did not reveal any growth. Later he developed watery diarrhea and colonoscopy revealed multiple small polyps and ulcers throughout the colon extending up to the ileum, Which was confirmed to be due to cytomegalovirus confirmed by PCR and successfully treated with ganciclovir. Positron emission tomography scan guided biopsies of the gut and lymph nodes confirmed presence of mycobacterial spindle cell pseudo-tumours and PCR assays revealed positive HSP65. The culture grew Mycobacterium Simiae. Flow cytometry analysis on patient's blood showed extremely low T and B cell counts and immunofixation revealed low immunoglobulin levels. His condition was later diagnosed as adult onset immunodeficiency due to anti- interferon - gamma autoantibodies. He was initially commenced on empirical anti-TB treatment with atypical mycobacterial coverage. He is currently on a combination of daily clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, linezolid with monthly 2g/kg/intravenous immunoglobulin to which, he had a remarkable clinical response with complete resolution of lymphadenopathy and healing of sinuses. CONCLUSIONS: This infection is considered to be restricted to certain geographic areas such as mainly Iran, Cuba, Israel and Arizona and this is the first case report from Sri lanka. Even though the infection is mostly seen in the elderly patients, our patient was only 24years old. In the literature pulmonary involvement was common presentation, but in this case the patient had generalized lymphadenopathy and colonic involvement without pulmonary involvement."

Several cases in refugees from the Horn of Africa have been recently diagnosed in four European countries. CASE PRESENTATION: We report four additional cases of LBRF in asylum seekers from Somalia and Eritrea who presented with fever shortly after arriving in Switzerland during a seven-month period. Multiple spirochetes were visualized on stained blood films which were identified as Borrelia recurrentis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. All patients recovered after antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone and/or doxycycline. Concurrent infections (malaria and tuberculosis) were diagnosed in half of our patients. Possible modes of transmission and preventive measures are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: These reported cases highlight the ongoing transmission of LBRF in migrants from East Africa. Diagnosis of LBRF cases and prevention of autochthonous transmission in asylum seeker camps are important steps for the near future.

This study evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of TIV in HIV-infected adults. METHODS: In Johannesburg, South Africa, we undertook a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 506 HIV-infected adults. Subjects included 157 individuals who were antiretroviral treatment (ART) naive and 349 on stable-ART. Participants were randomly assigned to receive TIV or normal saline intramuscularly. Oropharyngeal swabs were obtained at illness visits during the influenza season and tested by shell vial culture and RT PCR assay for influenza virus. Immune response was evaluated by hemagglutinin antibody inhibition assay (HAI) in a nested cohort. The primary study outcome involved vaccine efficacy against influenza confirmed illness. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00757900. RESULTS: The efficacy of TIV against confirmed influenza illness was 75.5% (95% CI: 9.2%-95.6%); with a risk difference of 0.18 per 100 person-weeks in TIV recipients. Among TIV recipients, seroconversion, measured by HAI titers, was evident in 52.6% for H1N1, 60.8% for H3N2, and 53.6% for influenza B virus. This compared with 2.2%, 2.2%, and 4.4% of placebo recipients (P < .0001). The frequency of local and systemic adverse events post-immunization was similar between study groups. CONCLUSIONS: TIV immunization is safe and efficacious in African HIV-infected adults without underlying co-morbidities. Further evaluation of effectiveness is warranted in severely immunocompromized HIV-infected adults and those with co-morbidities such as tuberculosis."

Identification of HIV-1-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with potent ADCC activity may help develop an effective HIV-1 vaccine. In present study, we isolated such human mAb, designated E10, from an HIV-1-infected patient sample by single B cell sorting and single cell PCR. E10 bound to gp140 trimer and linear peptides derived from gp41 membrane proximal external region (MPER). E10 epitope (QEKNEQELLEL) overlapped with mAb 2F5 epitope. However, E10 differentiated from 2F5 in neutralization breadth and potency, as well as ADCC activity. E10 showed low neutralization activity and narrow spectrum of neutralization compared to 2F5, but it mediated higher ADCC activity than 2F5 at low antibody concentration. Fine mapping of E10 epitope may potentiate MPER-based subunit vaccine development."

The aim of this study was to qualify novel DILI biomarkers (keratin-18 markers M65/M30, microRNA-122, glutamate dehydrogenase and alpha-foetoprotein) in human DILI. METHODS: Levels of the novel biomarkers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in two human DILI cohorts: a human volunteer study with acetaminophen and a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/tuberculosis (TB) study. RESULTS: In the acetaminophen study, serum M65 and microRNA-122 levels were significantly increased at an earlier time point than ALT. Furthermore, the maximal elevation of M65 and microRNA-122 exceeded the increase in ALT. In the HIV/TB study, all the analysed novel biomarkers increased after 1 week of treatment. In contrast to ALT, the novel biomarkers remained stable in a human cohort with exercise-induced muscular injury. CONCLUSIONS: M65 and microRNA-122 are potential biomarkers of DILI superior to ALT with respect to sensitivity and specificity."

Given that LXR exerts a protective immune response against M. tuberculosis, here we analyzed whether AIM is involved in this response. In an experimental murine model of tuberculosis, AIM serum levels peaked dramatically early after infection with M. tuberculosis, providing an in vivo biological link to the disease. We therefore studied the participation of AIM in macrophage response to M. tuberculosis in vitro. For this purpose, we used the H37Rv strain to infect THP-1 macrophages transfected to stably express AIM, thereby increasing infected macrophage survival. Furthermore, the expression of this protein enlarged foam cell formation by enhancing intracellular lipid content. Phagocytosis assays with FITC-labeled M. tuberculosis bacilli indicated that this protein was not involved in bacterial uptake; however, AIM expression decreased the number of intracellular cfus by up to 70% in bacterial killing assays, suggesting that AIM enhances macrophage mycobactericidal activity. Accordingly, M. tuberculosis-infected AIM-expressing cells upregulated the production of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis showed increased mRNA levels of the antimicrobial peptides cathelicidin and defensin 4B. These increases were concomitant with greater cellular concentrations of the autophagy-related molecules Beclin 1 and LC3II, as well as enhanced acidification of mycobacterial phagosomes and LC3 co-localization. In summary, our data support the notion that AIM contributes to key macrophage responses to M. tuberculosis."

A lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 268/mm3 and culture became positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Six days after admission, the adenosine deaminase (ADA) level in CSF markedly elevated (43.3 IU/L) with pleocytosis, but a negative PCR test for tuberculosis in CSF, sputum, gastric fluid. She recovered by antibiotics for 45 days and ADA level in CSF was normalized. She was diagnosed as listeria meningitis. High levels of ADA in CSF have high sensitivity and high specificity for tuberculous meningitis, but there are some reports that high ADA levels in CSF in other meningitis. The main biological role of ADA is related to proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes, and specific activity of this enzyme is slightly higher in T-lymphocytes than in B-lymphocytes. Protective immunity to Listeria monocytogenes is exclusively exhibited by T-lymphocytes. We consider that increased ADA levels in listeria meningitis associated with elevation of T-lymphocytes in CSF. This report suggests that listeria meningitis must be included in the differential diagnosis of high levels of ADA in CSF."

RESULTS: A total of 4245 patients were included, 716 (16.2%) had an opportunistic infection: 249 (34.7%) TB, 40 (5.6%) nontuberculous mycobacteria, 227 (31.7%) histoplasmosis, 138 (19.3%) cryptococcosis, and 62 (8.6%) had multiple opportunistic infections. Two hundred sixty-three [92.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 89-95.1] of TB cases were diagnosed by PCR. Urine antigen assay detected 94% (95% CI, 89-96) of the disseminated histoplasmosis cases. A lateral flow assay to detect cryptococcal antigen diagnosed 97% (95% CI, 93.3-98.7%) of the cryptococcal cases. In 85 patients (51.5%) with a cerobrospinal fluid sample, cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed in 55 (64.7%), of which 18 (32.7%) were only detected by cryptococcal antigen. CONCLUSION: Validated commercial antigen tests, as used in this program, should be the new gold standard for histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis diagnosis. In their absence, 35% of disseminated histoplasmosis and 32.7% of cryptococcal meningitis cases would have been missed. Patients with multiple opportunistic infections were frequently diagnosed and strategies should be designed to screen patients irrespective of their clinical presentation. In low resource settings, Diagnostic Laboratory Hubs can deliver quality diagnostics services in record time at affordable prices."

Two days after antimicrobial completion, the patient presented with night sweats and weakness. Chest x-ray revealed new right upper lobe pulmonary infiltrates, and the AFB culture sent during her prior admission returned positive for TB. RIPE therapy with moxifloxacin was initiated. Although she responded well to treatment, she retained functional immobility. We report a case of musculoskeletal TB initially misdiagnosed as enterococcus sacroiliitis, resulting in a delayed initiation of anti-tuberculous therapy. A high index of suspicion and rapid detection with TB-PCR testing should be considered to avoid delayed diagnosis."

Late Presenters, Very Late Presenters and AIDS presenters still represent, also in Europe, including Italy, a huge challenge in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old male with a history of fever and back pain. HIV test resulted positive with a high HIV Viral Load and a very low T-CD4 number of cells (5 cells/mm(3)). Imaging investigations revealed multiple vertebral and pulmonary lesions together with abdominal and thoracic lymphadenopathy. Blood cultures were positive for Cryptococcus neoformans and for Staphylococcus haemolyticus. Lymphnode biopsy resulted positive in PCR for Non-Tuberculosis Mycobacteria (Mycobacterium chelonae). A gastric biopsy also revealed a GIST. The patient also had CMV DNA positive. Although we performed antiretroviral therapy and specific-therapies for each disease, he was transferred to intensive care unit where he died due to an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. CONCLUSION: The reported case is unusual due to the relevant number of opportunistic diseases (both infectious and tumoral) emerging not long after the HIV infection had been diagnosed. Late presenters HIV patients and AIDS presenters still represent a challenge, which is often too complex for clinicians to deal with. In spite of proper management, the risk of suboptimal results cannot be excluded."

We investigated the temporal progression in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, we included confirmed cases of COVID-19 from Jan 20 to Feb 6, 2020 in Shanghai. Final date of follow-up was February 25, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 249 patients enrolled, the median age was 51 years old, and 126 (50.6%) were male. The duration from onset of symptoms to hospitalization was 4(2-7) days in symptomatic patients. Fever was occurred in 235(94.3%) patients. A total of 215 (86.3%) patients had been discharged after 16(12-20) days hospitalization. The estimated median duration of fever in all the patients with fever was 10 days (95 confidential intervals [CIs]: 8-11 days) after onset of symptoms. Patients who were transferred to intensive care units (ICU) had significantly longer duration of fever as compared to those not in ICU (31 days v.s. 9 days after onset of symptoms, respectively, P<0.0001). Radiological aggravation of initial image was observed in 163 (65.7%) patients on day 7 after onset of symptoms. 154(94.5%) of these patients showed radiological improvement on day 14. The median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days (95 CIs: 10-12 days). Viral clearance was more likely to be delayed in patients in ICU than those not in ICU (P<0.0001). In multivariate logistical analysis, age (Odds ratio [OR]=1.06) and CD4 T cell count (OR=0.55 per 100 cells/ul increase) were independently associated with ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild. The clinical progression pattern suggests that early control of viral replication and application of host-directed therapy in later stage is essential to improve the prognosis of CVOID-19."

Patients with TB have a high rate of vitamin D deficiency, both at diagnosis and during the course of treatment with anti-tuberculosis drugs. Although data on the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) clearance is uncertain from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), vitamin D enhances the expression of the anti-microbial peptide human cathelicidin (hCAP18) in cultured macrophages in vitro. One possible explanation for the mixed (primarily negative) results of RCTs examining vitamin D treatment in TB infection is that anti-TB drugs given to enrolled subjects may impact actions of vitamin D to enhance cathelicidin in macrophages. To address this hypothesis, human macrophage-like monocytic (THP-1) cells were treated with varying doses of first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs in the presence of the active form of vitamin D, 1N1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)). The expression of hCAP18 was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) strongly induced expression of hCAP18 mRNA in THP-1 cells (fold-change from control). The combination of the standard 4-drug TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) in the cultured THP-1 cells demonstrated a significant decrease of hCAP18 mRNA at the dosage of 10 ug/mL. In 31 subjects with newly diagnosed drug-sensitive TB randomized to either high-dose vitamin D(3) (1.2 million IU over 8 weeks, n=13) versus placebo (n=18), there was no change from baseline to week 8 in hCAP18 mRNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or in plasma concentrations of LL-37, the protein product of hCAP18.These data suggest that first-line anti-TB drugs may alter the vitamin D-dependent increase in hCAP18 and LL-37 human macrophages."

Novel, rapid, cheaper and accurate methods are needed. The Alere Determine TB lipoarabinomannan antigen (LAM-test) is a World Health Organization-endorsed point-of-care urine test designed to detect active TB disease in humans. The Lionex Animal TB Rapid Test (Lionex-test) is a novel animal specific TB diagnostic blood test. An animal level analysis was performed using urine (n=141) and milk (n=63) samples from depopulated BTB-suspected cattle to test the accuracy of the LAM-test when compared to results of positive TB detection by any routine BTB tests (BOVIGAM, necropsy, histology, culture, PCR) that are regularly performed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The agreement between the urine LAM-test and USDA standard tests were poor at varying testing time points. The same milk samples did not elicit statistically significant agreement with the Lionex-test, although positive trends were present. Hence, we cannot recommend the LAM-test as a valid BTB diagnostic test in cattle using either urine or milk. The Lionex-test's production of positive trends using milk samples suggests larger sample sizes may validate the Lionex-test in accurately diagnosing BTB in cattle using milk samples, potentially providing a quick and reliable field test for BTB."

In this study, we aimed to evaluate DM-mediated alterations in clinical, radiological and immunological outcomes in TB disease. METHODS: Newly diagnosed pulmonary TB patients with or without DM (TB n=40; TB-DM n=40) were recruited in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Clinical symptoms, sputum smear and culture conversion as well as chest radiography were assessed. Peripheral blood and sputum samples were collected at the time of diagnosis (baseline) and after 1, 2 and 6months of standard anti-TB treatment. Blood samples were also obtained from healthy controls (n=20). mRNA expression of inflammatory markers in blood and sputum samples were quantified using real-time PCR. RESULTS: The majority of TB-DM patients had poor glycemic control (HbA1c>8%) and displayed elevated pulmonary pathology (P=0.039) particularly in the middle (P<0.004) and lower lung zones (P<0.02) throughout the treatment period. However, reduction of clinical symptoms and time to sputum smear and culture conversion did not differ between the groups. Transcripts levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 (P=0.003 at month-1 and P=0.045 at month-2) and TNF- (P=0.005 at month-1) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (P=0.005 at month-2) were higher in peripheral blood after anti-TB treatment in TB-DM compared to TB patients. Conversely in sputum, TB-DM patients had reduced CD4 (P<0.009 at month-1) and IL-10 (P=0.005 at month-1 and P=0.006 at month-2) transcripts, whereas CD8 was elevated (P=0.016 at month-2). At 1- and 2-month post-treatment, sputum IL-10 transcripts were inversely correlated with fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels in all patients. CONCLUSION: Insufficient up-regulation of IL-10 in the lung may fuel persistent local inflammation thereby promoting lung pathology in TB-DM patients with poorly controlled DM."

METHODS: The prospective study was conducted from January 2000 to October 2001 at a tertiary care referral teaching hospital in Mumbai, India. Admitted in-patients (aged 1 month to 12 years) detected to be HIV-positive (on triple ELISA test) were enrolled in the study. HIV status of patients < 18 months of age was confirmed by DNA-PCR testing. Demographic data, clinical features, investigations and outcome were recorded in a pre-designed proforma. RESULTS: Fifty HIV-positive children (31 males and 19 females; M:F = 1.6:1) were enrolled. Thirty cases were completely immunized, 9 were partially immunized while 11 were not immunized. Forty-two were perinatally infected, while eight cases were infected via blood transfusion (patients with thalassemia major on chronic transfusion therapy). Clinical features at presentation in 42 symptomatic cases included protein-energy malnutrition (90%), fever > 1 month (50%), weight loss > 1 month (50%), persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (24%) and skin manifestations (79%). The gastrointestinal (62%) and respiratory (52%) were the most commonly involved organ systems. Opportunistic infections noted included tuberculosis (19 cases), candidiasis (6 cases), Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (4 cases), herpes zoster (3 cases) and giardiasis (1 case). Six patients died (mortality, 14%). CONCLUSIONS: Perinatal transmission is the most common mode of acquiring HIV in the pediatric age group. Most patients have protein-energy malnutrition. Tuberculosis is common in HIV-infected Indian children. Patients with HIV-encephalopathy have a poor outcome."

OBJECTIVES: This review aims to propose the preparation process from ancient teeth collection to organic molecule extraction of dental pulp and summary, analyze the methods that have been applied to detect septicemic pathogens through ancient dental pulps during the past 20years following the first detection of an ancient microbe. METHODS: The papers used in this review with two main objectives were obtained from PubMed and Google scholar with combining keywords: ""ancient,"" ""dental pulp,"" ""teeth,"" ""anatomy,"" ""structure,"" ""collection,"" ""preservation,"" ""selection,"" ""photography,"" ""radiography,"" ""contamination,"" ""decontamination,"" ""DNA,"" ""protein,"" ""extraction,"" ""bone,"" ""paleomicrobiology,"" ""bacteria,"" ""virus,"" ""pathogen,"" ""molecular biology,"" ""proteomics,"" ""PCR,"" ""MALDI-TOF,"" ""LC/MS,"" ""ELISA,"" ""immunology,"" ""immunochromatography,"" ""genome,"" ""microbiome,"" ""metagenomics."" RESULTS: The analysis of ancient dental pulp should have a careful preparation process with many different steps to give highly accurate results, each step complies with the rules in archaeology and paleomicrobiology. After the collection of organic molecules from dental pulp, they were investigated for pathogen identification based on the analysis of DNA and protein. Actually, DNA approach takes a principal role in diagnosis while the protein approach is more and more used. A total of seven techniques was used and ten bacteria (Yersinia pestis, Bartonella quintana, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi C, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia prowazeki, Staphylococcus aureus, Borrelia recurrentis, Bartonella henselae) and one virus (Anelloviridae) were identified. Y. pestis had the most published in quantity and all methods were investigated for this pathogen, S. aureus and B. recurrentis were identified by three different methods and others only by one. The combining methods interestingly increase the positive rate with ELISA, PCR and iPCR in Yersinia pestis diagnosis. Twenty-seven ancient genomes of Y. pestis and one ancient genome of B. recurrentis were reconstructed. Comparing to the ancient bone, ancient teeth showed more advantage in septicemic diagnosis. Beside pathogen identification, ancient pulp help to distinguish species. CONCLUSIONS: Dental pulp with specific tissue is a suitable sample for detection of the blood infection in the past through DNA and protein identification with the correct preparation process, furthermore, it helps to more understand the pathogens of historic diseases and epidemics."

A biomarker of STI-induced upper tract inflammation would be significant as many women are asymptomatic and delayed treatment increases risk of sequelae. Blood mRNA from 111 women from three cohorts was profiled using microarray. Unsupervised analysis revealed a transcriptional profile that distinguished 9 cases of STI-induced endometritis from 18 with cervical STI or uninfected controls. Using a hybrid feature selection algorithm we identified 21 genes that yielded maximal classification accuracy within our training dataset. Predictive accuracy was evaluated using an independent testing dataset of 5 cases and 10 controls. Sensitivity was evaluated in a separate test set of 12 women with asymptomatic STI-induced endometritis in whom cervical burden was determined by PCR; and specificity in an additional test set of 15 uninfected women with pelvic pain due to unknown cause. Disease module preservation was assessed in 42 women with a clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). We also tested the ability of the biomarker to discriminate STI-induced endometritis from other diseases. The biomarker was 86.7% (13/15) accurate in correctly distinguishing cases from controls in the testing dataset. Sensitivity was 83.3% (5/6) in women with high cervical Chlamydia trachomatis burden and asymptomatic endometritis, but 0% (0/6) in women with low burden. Specificity in patients with non-STI-induced pelvic pain was 86.7% (13/15). Disease modules were preserved in all 8 biomarker predicted cases. The 21-gene biomarker was highly discriminatory for systemic infections, lupus, and appendicitis, but wrongly predicted tuberculosis as STI-induced endometritis in 52.4%. A 21-gene biomarker can identify asymptomatic women with STI-induced endometritis that places them at risk for chronic disease development and discriminate STI-induced endometritis from non-STI pelvic pain and other diseases."

We examined the relationship between presence of P. falciparum DNA in plasma samples and clinical malaria as well as the impact of atazanavir, an HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PI), on P. falciparum PCR positivity. METHODS: ACTG study A5175 compared two NNRTI-based regimens and one PI-based anti-retroviral (ARV) regimen in antiretroviral therapy nave participants. We performed nested PCR on plasma samples for the P. falciparum 18s rRNA gene to detect the presence of malaria DNA in 215 of the 221 participants enrolled in Blantyre and Lilongwe, Malawi. We also studied the closest sample preceding the first malaria diagnosis from 102 persons with clinical malaria and randomly selected follow up samples from 88 persons without clinical malaria. RESULTS: PCR positivity was observed in 18 (8%) baseline samples and was not significantly associated with age, sex, screening CD4+ T-cell count, baseline HIV-1 RNA level or co-trimoxazole use within the first 8 weeks. Neither baseline PCR positivity (p = 0.45) nor PCR positivity after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (p = 1.0) were significantly associated with subsequent clinical malaria. Randomization to the PI versus NNRTI ARV regimens was not significantly associated with either PCR positivity (p = 0.5) or clinical malaria (p = 0.609). Clinical malaria was associated with a history of tuberculosis (p = 0.006) and a lower BMI (p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: P. falciparum DNA was detected in 8% of participants at baseline, but was not significantly associated with subsequent development of clinical malaria. HIV PI therapy did not decrease the prevalence of PCR positivity or incidence of clinical disease."

Our aim was to investigate expressions of leptin and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the adipose tissue, and their relationships to osteoporosis in patients with COPD. METHODS: In 39 patients with stable COPD, bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition was assessed by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry. Serum leptin was determined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and bone turnover markers osteocalcin and -crosslaps by the electrochemiluminiscence immunoassays. Subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were analyzed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients without, and 18 with osteoporosis were enrolled (35 men; age 62.2  7.3years). Compared to patients without osteoporosis, those with the disease had significantly lower serum levels and adipose tissue expressions of leptin, in association with increased serum -crosslaps (p=0.028, p=0.034, p=0.022, respectively). Log adipose tissue leptin was inversely related to serum -crosslaps (p=0.015), and directly to serum leptin (p<0.001) and to the total, femoral, and lumbar BMD and T-score (p<0.02 for all relationships). Adipose tissue OPG expression was related to all variables of bone density except for lumbar BMD and T-score (p<0.05 for all relationships). Log adipose tissue leptin and OPG expressions predicted femoral T-score independently of age, gender and pulmonary function (p<0.001, adjusted R(2)=0.383; p=0.008, adjusted R(2)=0.301, respectively). Introducing body mass (or fat mass) index into these models eliminated independent predictive value of leptin and OPG expressions. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that adipose tissue leptin and OPG expressions are related to osteoporosis in patients with COPD, and appear to act as mediators between fat mass and BMD."

Blood sample was collected after 3 h to carry out phenotyping for CYP2C19 enzyme by measuring omeprazole hydroxylation index (OHI) using LC-MS/MS. The phenotyping procedure was repeated after 1 month of ATT. CYP2C19 genotyping was carried out by PCR-RFLP method. Significant reduction in OHI was observed after 1 month of ATT in all the metabolizer groups. The percentage reduction in OHI was maximum with poor metabolizers, 84.1 (IQR - 74.6, 86.6), and minimum with ultra-rapid metabolizers, 39.6 (IQR - 12.7, 54.7). CYP2C19 enzyme induction is predominant in patients after 1 month of antituberculosis treatment (ATT). Genetic variations in the enzyme could not clearly explain the interindividual differences in induction. There is a potential risk of drug failure/adverse effect in poor metabolizers regardless of their genotype after ATT."

It is known that, apart from the most prevalent PI*S and PI*Z A1AT deficiency variants, other so-called rare variants also predispose individuals to severe chronic respiratory disorders such as emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Our aim was to assess the frequencies of common and rare SERPINA1 mutations in a group of 1033 Polish patients referred for A1AT deficiency diagnostics due to chronic respiratory disorders in the period of January 2014-September 2015. All blood samples were analyzed according to the routine diagnostic protocol, including A1AT serum concentration assessment by nephelometry and immune isoelectric focusing, followed by PCR genotyping and direct sequencing when necessary. A total of 890 out of the 1033 samples (86%) carried the normal PI*MM genotype, whereas, in 143 samples (14%), at least one A1AT deficiency variant was detected. In 132 subjects, PI*S (2.1%) and PI*Z (10.8%) common deficiency alleles were identified, yielding frequencies of 0.011 and 0.062, respectively. Rare SERPINA1 variants were detected in nine patients: PI*F (c.739C>T) (n=5) and PI*I (c.187C>T) (n=4). Samples from the patients with an A1AT serum concentration below 120mg/dl and presenting a PI*MM-like phenotypic pattern were retrospectively analyzed by direct sequencing for rare SERPINA1 mutations, revealing a PI*M2Obernburg (c.514G>T) mutation in one patient and a non-pathogenic mutation (c.922G>T) in another. We conclude that the deficiency PI*Z A1AT allele is considerably more common in patients with chronic respiratory disorders than in the general Polish population. The prevalence of the PI*F allele seems higher than in other European studies."

On the Thai-Myanmar border, all pregnant women are followed systematically with active weekly malaria screening. Over a 27-year period of providing antenatal care, 48,983 have been prospectively followed until pregnancy outcome (miscarriage or delivery) and 4,298 women have had P. vivax detected at least once. Reported here is the first known P. vivax-associated death amongst these women. The initial patient presentation was of uncomplicated P. vivax (0.5% parasitaemia) in a term, multigravida woman who responded rapidly to oral artesunate and mefloquine treatment, clearing her blood stage parasites within 48 hours. The patient appeared well, was ambulatory and due to be discharged but became unwell with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring ventilation three days (67 hours) into treatment. Despite induction and delivery of a stillborn foetus, ventilatory requirements increased and the patient died on day 7. The patient had a low body mass index. Sensitive detection with nested PCR confirmed only the presence of P. vivax species and concomitant infections such as tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were also ruled out. The contemporaneous treatment of acute uncomplicated P. vivax and the onset of ARDS on day 3 in this patient implies a possible but unconfirmed association with death in this patient. Assuming this death was caused by P. vivax, the risk of ARDS-related maternal mortality in this setting did not differ significantly between Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax (0.24 per 1,000 (1/4,158) versus 0.23 per 1,000 (1/4,298), contrary to the increased risk of maternal mortality from P. falciparum compared to P. vivax, 2.89 per 1,000 (12/4,158) versus 0.23 per 1,000 (1/4,298), P=0.003."

METHODS: We evaluated samples obtained from 150 participants (including 55 men) in whom ZIKV RNA was detected on reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay in urine or blood in an enhanced arboviral clinical surveillance site. We collected serum, urine, saliva, semen, and vaginal secretions weekly for the first month and then at 2, 4, and 6 months. All specimens were tested by means of RT-PCR, and serum was tested with the use of anti-ZIKV IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among the participants with ZIKV RNA in any specimen at week 4, biweekly collection continued until all specimens tested negative. We used parametric Weibull regression models to estimate the time until the loss of ZIKV RNA detection in each body fluid and reported the findings in medians and 95th percentiles. RESULTS: The medians and 95th percentiles for the time until the loss of ZIKV RNA detection were 14 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 11 to 17) and 54 days (95% CI, 43 to 64), respectively, in serum; 8 days (95% CI, 6 to 10) and 39 days (95% CI, 31 to 47) in urine; and 34 days (95% CI, 28 to 41) and 81 days (95% CI, 64 to 98) in semen. Few participants had detectable ZIKV RNA in saliva or vaginal secretions. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged time until ZIKV RNA clearance in serum in this study may have implications for the diagnosis and prevention of ZIKV infection. Current sexual-prevention guidelines recommend that men use condoms or abstain from sex for 6 months after ZIKV exposure; in 95% of the men in this study, ZIKV RNA was cleared from semen after about 3 months.

Multifocal tuberculosis involving multiple systems with associated symptoms are rare, which makes the diagnosis challenging. Distinguishing multifocal tuberculosis from lesions metastatic from system malignancy is difficult. Single detection method is difficult to make a diagnosis. A combination of multiple methods is essential. Case presentation: A 17-year-old male presented with a 20 days weakness of lower limbs, which aggravated for 6 days. The PET/CT showed increased metabolism of ileocecal intestinal and terminal ileum wall, multiple enlarged lymph node (LNs), multiple osteolytic bone lesions, and soft tissue intensity belong T7 and T8 vertebrae. To confirm the diagnosis of the disease, a biopsy of the mediastinum lymph nodes was carried out. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of the specimen was positive for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the T-SPOT and Xpert MTB/RIF test were also positive, which suggested the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The final diagnosis was multifocal tuberculosis, the patients received the resection of the mass in the spine. Anti-tuberculosis drugs were given. The myodynamia and muscle tension of the patients recovered following the therapy. Conclusions: Our results indicated that Multifocal tuberculosis should also be taken into consideration when lesions metastatic from system malignancy were suspected from images results even without the clinical symptoms of tuberculosis, and combination of multiple diagnosis methods were essential for the diagnosis of multifocal disease.  2020 The Author(s)."

The patient was hospitalized after 7 months of illness. The survey was conducted for pulmonary tuberculosis, an endemic disease in Brazil. She presented multiple central pulmonary nodules images, with central cavitation. Methodology/Principal findings The patient bronchoalveolar lavage was cultured and Sporothrix sp. growth was obtained. Then, the isolate (LMMM1097) was accurately identified to the species level by using spe-cies-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

We evaluated Raman spectroscopy (RS) for serum-protein fingerprinting from 26 active TB (ATB) cases, 20 LTBI cases, 34 early clearance (EC; TB-exposed persons with undetected infection) and 38 healthy controls (HC). RS at 532 nm using candidate peaks provided 92.31% sensitivity and 90.0% to distinguish ATB from LTBI, 84.62% sensitivity and 89.47% specificity to distinguish ATB from HC and 87.10% sensitivity and 85.0% specificity to distinguish LTBI from EC. RS at 532 nm with the random forest model provided 86.84% sensitivity and 65.0% specificity to distinguish LTBI from HC and 94.74% sensitivity and 87.10% specificity to distinguish EC from HC. Using preliminary sample sets (n = 5 for each TB-infection category), surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) showed high potential diagnostic performance, distinguishing very clearly among all TB-infection categories with 100% sensitivity and specificity. With lower cost, shorter turnaround time and performance comparable to that of IGRAs, our study demonstrated RS and SERS to have high potential for ATB and LTBI diagnosis.  2020 Elsevier Ltd"

Extrapulmonary tuberculosis at the level of the central nervous system is the most devastating and deadly form of tuberculosis. We present the case of a 73-year-old male Ecuadorian patient with no history of contact with tuberculosis and with a clinical picture of 4 days of evolution characterized by aphasia, deviation of the labial commissure, and deterioration of the level of consciousness with a Glasgow coma score of 7/15. A brain tomography showed evidence of indirect signs of cerebral ischemia; the patient was therefore diagnosed with non-specific cerebrovascular disease. Due to the critical nature of his clinical picture, the patient entered the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), where a chest x-ray was performed and bilateral perihilar alveolar opacities with a reticular and nodular pattern were visualized. These results, combined with the bronchoalveolar brushing, evidenced the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Adenosine of deaminase (ADA) was also detected in the cerebrospinal fluid with 30.7 /L and a molecular biology technique was used with high-multiplex real-time polymerase matrix MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Brucker Daltonics) for rapid identification of the causative agent.

Study of patients with clinical suspicion in which the parasite is not observed,0,"Background: Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is a serious protozoal disease endemic in diverse areas, including the southern area of Madrid (Spain), where an outbreak was detected in 2009. The objective of this work is to analyze bone marrow alterations in VL patients and elaborate a diagnostic model with the aim to improve the early detection of this disease. The usual diagnostic methods, as the observation of the parasite on a bone marrow aspirate, have frequent false negatives, and the high sensitivity methods, as PCR and ELISA, are delayed or are not always available. Methods: This observational study evaluated bone marrow parameters of adult patients with clinical suspicion of VL, in which a bone marrow aspiration was performed but Leishmania was not directly observed, during the period 2009-2014. The patients finally diagnosed of VL by other methods (VL group, n=41), and the patients in which the VL was not diagnosed (non-VL group, n=20) were compared. A multivariant model was elaborated and externally validated. Results: The final multivariant model includes percentage of myeloid series, percentage of plasma cells and quantification of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.87 (0.78-0.96). The model performed well in the external validation. Conclusion: In cases of VL suspicion and when the parasite is not observed in the bone marrow aspiration, the proposed model could be useful in discriminating between patients with and without VL, allowing to take a therapeutic decision while awaiting the definitive diagnosis.  2019 European Federation of Internal Medicine"

The pathogenesis is a combination of true pleural infection and an effusive hypersensitivity reaction, compartmentalized within the pleural space. Diagnostic thoracentesis with thorough pleural fluid analysis including biomarkers such as adenosine deaminase and gamma interferon achieves high accuracy in the correct clinical context. Definitive diagnosis may require invasive procedures to demonstrate histological evidence of caseating granulomas or microbiological evidence of the organism on smear or culture. Drug resistance is an emerging problem that requires vigilance and extra effort to acquire a complete drug sensitivity profile for each tuberculous effusion treated. Nucleic acid amplification tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF can be invaluable in this instance; however, the yield is low in pleural fluid. Treatment consists of standard anti-tuberculous therapy or a guideline-based individualized regimen in the case of drug resistance. There is low-quality evidence that suggests possible benefit from corticosteroids; however, they are not currently recommended due to concomitant increased risk of adverse effects. Small studies report some short- and long-term benefit from interventions such as therapeutic thoracentesis, intrapleural fibrinolytics and surgery but many questions remain to be answered.  2019 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology"

Furthermore, performance of the assay was evaluated on the sputum samples and compared with smear microscopy, culture and PCR. mpt64 (also called mpb64 or Rv1980c) loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) successfully detected 1pg DNA within 40min and successfully rejected NTMs and other bacterial species tested. It specifically detected all the 119 confirmed TB cases and 100 of the 104 control cases. The resulting sensitivity and specificity of LAMP assay was found to be 100% (95% CI: 9679100%) and 9615% (95% CI; 90449894%) respectively. Significance and Impact of the Study: Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a technique for isothermal DNA amplification suitable for cost-limited settings as it prevents the use of sophisticated instruments. Using mpt64 antigenic protein gene, we developed a LAMP assay especially for organisms of the M. tuberculosis complex. mpt64 LAMP assay showed 100% sensitivity and detected all the bacteriologically and clinically positive TB cases not detected by smear, culture or PCR methods.  2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology"

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is arguably the most lethal form of tuberculosis and requires prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment to prevent death and serious neurological disability. The development of rapid diagnostic tests using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), including the World Health Organization (WHO)  endorsed Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay, has allowed earlier definite diagnosis of TBM than conventional culture methods which usually take two weeks or longer for positive identification of MTB.

Diagnosis is notoriously difficult; manifestations are protean due to the high proportion of cases of extra-pulmonary TB in children, and logistical problems exist in obtaining suitable specimens. These issues are compounded by the paucibacillary nature of disease with the result that an estimated 96% of pediatric TB-associated mortality occurs prior to commencing anti-tuberculous treatment. Further development of sensitive, rapid diagnostic tests and their incorporation into diagnostic algorithms is vital in this population, and central to the WHO End-TB strategy. Initial gains were made with the expansion of nucleic acid amplification technology, particularly the introduction of the GeneXpert fully-automated PCR Xpert MTB/Rif assay in 2010, and more recently, the Xpert MTB/Rif Ultra (Ultra) assay in 2017. Ultra provides increased analytical sensitivity when compared with the initial Xpert assay in vitro; a finding now also supported by six clinical studies to date, two of which included pediatric samples. Here, we review the published evidence for the performance of Ultra in TB diagnosis in children, as well as studies in adults with paucibacillary disease providing results relevant to the pediatric population. Following on from this, we speculate upon future directions for Ultra, with focus on its potential use with alternative diagnostic specimens, which may be of particular utility in children.  2019 Atherton, Cresswell, Ellis, Kitaka and Boulware."

Between July 2017 and March 2018, 218 and 210 suspected plTB patients were prospectively enrolled from Wuhan (training) and Guangzhou (validation) cohort, respectively. PB T-SPOT, PF T-SPOT, and other conventional tests were simultaneously performed. Our data showed the performance of PB T-SPOT in diagnosing plTB was limited, especially with low sensitivity. However, the results of early secreted antigenic target 6 (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP-10) in PF T-SPOT were significantly increased compared with those in PB T-SPOT in plTB patients. If using 76 as the cutoff value of MAX (the larger of ESAT-6 and CFP-10) in Wuhan cohort, the sensitivity and specificity of PF T-SPOT to diagnose plTB were 89.76 and 96.70%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of PF T-SPOT was better than other routine tests such as pathogen detection methods and biochemical markers. The diagnostic accuracy of PF T-SPOT in Guangzhou cohort was similar to that in Wuhan cohort, with a sensitivity and specificity of 91.07 and 94.90%, respectively. Furthermore, CD4+ T cells were more activated in PF compared with PB, and the frequency of mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD4+ T cells in PF was significantly higher than that in PB in plTB patients. In conclusion, the performance of PF T-SPOT is obviously better than PB T-SPOT or other laboratory tests, which suggests that PF T-SPOT assay has been of great value in the diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis.  2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

To date, only 4 cases have been reported in which the patient developed a combination of mycotic aortic aneurysm and BCG spondylitis. Accurate diagnosis of BCG spondylitis is important because it is an iatrogenic disease, and its treatment is different from usual tuberculous spondylitis. However, distinguishing BCG spondylitis from usual tuberculous spondylitis is very difficult and takes a long time. In this study, we were able to suspect BCG spondylitis at an early stage from the result of the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Case presentation: We encountered a case of BCG spondylitis with adjacent mycotic aortic aneurysm after intravesical BCG therapy in a 76-year-old man. We performed a 2-stage operation to obtain spine stabilization and replace the aneurysm with a synthetic graft. We started multidrug therapy with antituberculosis medication, excluding pyrazinamide, because the patient's history of BCG therapy, negative IGRA, and positive of tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (Tb-PCR) suggested that the pathogenic bacteria of the spondylitis was BCG. Eventually the bacterial strain was identified as BCG by PCR-based genomic deletion analysis. Conclusions: BCG infection should be considered in patients who have been treated with BCG therapy, even if the treatment was performed several months to several years previously. In the case of a patient with a history of BCG therapy, a positive Tb-PCR result and negative IGRA result probably suggest BCG infections, if the possibility of false-negative IGRA result can be excluded.  2018 The Author(s)."

Methods: Rv0432, Rv0674, Rvl566c and Rvl547 were amplified from M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv genomic DNA by using PCR, among which Rvl547 was divided into two segments for amplification (Rvl547-l and Rvl547-2). The segments were cloned into expression vector PET-32a while the recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography. Serums were incubated with BL21 (DE3) proteins. Antibodies IgG against M. tuberculosis were tested with 151 serum samples (41 healthy people and 110 TB patients) by using ELISA. The diagnostic efficiency of antigens was analyzed by means of receiver operating characteristic curve. Difference of the objective proteins in TB patients and healthy controls was compared by (-test. Results: Recombinant antigens Rv0432, Rv0674, Rvl566c, Rvl547-1 and Rv 1547-2 were successfully expressed and purified. Results: from ELISA showed that the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, Youden index and area under the curve of Rv0432, Rv0674, Rvl566c, Rvl547-1 and Rvl547-2, as 43.64%-92.73%, 80.49%-92.68%, 0.92-0.94, 0.38-0.80, 0.363-0.732 and 0.649-0.915. All the objective proteins showed significantly higher antibody levels in TB patients, when compared to the healthy controls (P< 0.000 1). Conclusion: The newly identified antigens Rv0432, Rv0674, Rvl566c, Rvl547-1 and Rvl547-2 all performed well when being used for TB serological diagnosis, thus were expected to be new candidate antigens used for TB diagnosis.  2018 Chinese Medical Association.

Extrapulmonary TB is uncommon and only accounts for 10-20% of overall TB disease burden. Abdominopelvic TB is the sixth most common location of extrapulmonary TB. The symptoms and signs are often insidious and nonspecific. Diagnosing abdominopelvic TB can be very challenging at times and poses great difficulties to the clinician. Infection with nontuberculous Mycobacterium (NTM) is even rarer especially in an immunocompetent patient. We report a case of NTM in abdominopelvic TB. A 37-year-old foreign worker, para 3, presented with a one-week history of suprapubic pain associated with fever. An assessment showed presence of a right adnexal mass. She was treated as tuboovarian abscess with intravenous antibiotics. Unfortunately, she did not respond. She underwent exploratory laparotomy. Intraoperatively, features of the mass were suggestive of a right mature cystic teratoma with presence of slough and cheesy materials all over the abdominal cavity as well as presence of ascites. Diagnosis of NTM was confirmed with PCR testing using the peritoneal fluid. This case was a diagnostic dilemma due to the nonspecific clinical presentation. Management of such rare infection was revisited.  2017 Beng Kwang Ng et al."

A total of 209 and 234 differentially expressed genes were detected in TB vs. LTBI and TB vs. HCs, respectively. Nineteen differentially expressed genes with top fold change between TB and the other 2 groups were validated using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), and showed 94.7% consistent expression pattern with microarray test. Six genes were selected for further validation in an independent sample set of 230 samples. Expression of the resistin (RETN) and kallikrein 1 (KLK1) genes showed the greatest difference between the TB and LTBI or HC groups (P < 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed that the areas under the curve (AUC) for RETN and KLK1 were 0.844 (0.783- 0.904) and 0.833 (0.769-0.897), respectively, when discriminating TB from LTBI. The combination of these two genes achieved the best discriminative capacity [AUC = 0.916 (0.872-0.961)], with a sensitivity of 71.2% (58.7%-81.7%) and a specificity of 93.6% (85.7%-97.9%). Our results provide a new potentially diagnostic signature for discriminating TB and LTBI and have important implications for better understanding the pathogenesis involved in the transition from latent infection to TB activation.

Short telomeres, markers of biological aging, are also associated with an increased risk of age-associated diseases and mortality. Our goals were to use a single cohort of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals hospitalized with pneumonia to assess whether shortened telomere length was associated with HIV infection, TB diagnosis, and 2-month mortality. Methods: This was a sub-study of the IHOP Study, a prospective observational study. Participants consisted of 184 adults admitted to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda who underwent evaluation for suspected TB and were followed for 2 months. Standardized questionnaires were administered to collect demographic and clinical data. PBMCs were isolated and analyzed using quantitative PCR to determine telomere length. The association between HIV infection, demographic and clinical characteristics, and telomere length was assessed, as were the associations between telomere length, TB diagnosis and 2-month mortality. Variables with a P0.2 in bivariate analysis were included in multivariate models. Results: No significant demographic or clinical differences were observed between the HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected subjects. Older age (P<0.0001), male gender (P = 0.04), total pack-years smoked (P<0.001), alcohol consumption in the past year (P = 0.12), and asthma (P = 0.08) were all associated (P<0.2) with shorter telomere length in bivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis adjusting for these five variables, HIV-positive participants had significantly shorter telomeres than HIV-negative participants ( = -0.0621, 95% CI -0.113 to -0.011, P = 0.02). Shortened telomeres were not associated with TB or short-term mortality. Conclusions: The association between HIV infection and shorter telomeres suggests that HIV may play a role in cellular senescence and biological aging and that shorter telomeres may be involved in age-associated health complications seen in this population. The findings indicate a need to further research the impact of HIV on aging.  2016 Auld et al.

Clinical diagnosis lacks standardization, and traditional and molecular microbiologic methods lack sensitivity, particularly in children. Immunodiagnostic tests may improve sensitivity, but these tests cannot distinguish tuberculosis disease from latent infection and some lack specificity. While molecular tools like Xpert MTB/RIF have advanced our ability to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to determine antimicrobial resistance, decades old technologies remain the standard in most locales.

To facilitate the early diagnosis of TB directly from clinical specimens, we have standardized and validated the use of nested multiplex PCR, targeting gene fragments IS6110, MTP40 and 32kD -antigen encoding genes specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and non-tubercular mycobacteria (NTM), in comparison to smear microscopy, solid culture and single step multiplex PCR. The results were evaluated in comparison to a composite reference standard (CRS) comprising of microbiological results (smear and culture), clinical, radiological and cytopathological findings, clinical treatment and response to anti-tubercular therapy. Methods: The nested multiplex PCR (nMPCR) assay was evaluated to test its utility in 600 (535 pulmonary and 65 extra-pulmonary specimens) clinically suspected TB cases. All specimens were processed for smear, culture, single step multiplex PCR and nested multiplex PCR testing. Results: Out of 535 screened pulmonary and 65 extra-pulmonary specimens, 329 (61.5 %) and 19 (29.2 %) cases were culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Based on CRS, 450 patients had ""clinical TB"" (definitive-TB, probable-TB and possible-TB). Remaining 150 were confirmed ""non-TB"" cases. For culture, the sensitivity was low, 79.3 % for pulmonary and 54.3 % for extra-pulmonary cases. The sensitivity and specificity results for nMPCR test were evaluated taken composite reference standard as a gold standard. The sensitivity of the nMPCR assay was 97.1 % for pulmonary and 91.4 % for extra-pulmonary TB cases with specificity of 100 % and 93.3 % respectively. Conclusion: Nested multiplex PCR using three gene primers is a rapid, reliable and highly sensitive and specific diagnostic technique for the detection and differentiation of M. tuberculosis complex from NTM genome and will be useful in diagnosing paucibacillary samples. Nested multiplex PCR assay was found to be better than single step multiplex PCR for assessing the diagnosis of TB.  2016 Sinha et al."

The clinical presentation in patients with multifocal musculoskeletal tuberculosis may closely mimic that in patients with multiple bone metastases, which makes the accurate clinical diagnosis challenging. Herein, we report a multifocal musculoskeletal tuberculosis case that was misdiagnosed for 8 months as multiple bone metastases. Case presentation: A 63-year-old male farmer of Chinese Han ethnicity presented to us with pain in left side of the neck, right side of the chest and the back for 10 months without typical tuberculosis symptoms. His past medical history, the CT and fluoroscopy-guided biopsy were negative for tuberculosis. Interferon gamma by T-SPOT was also negative. Radiological findings including CT, MRI and PET-CT suggested that the patient had multiple metastases. Accordingly, the patient was misdiagnosed as having musculoskeletal tumors until a swelling under the right nipple ulcerated. The smear test for acid-fast bacilli and the PCR test for TB-DNA of the pus from the swollen area were both positive, leading to the final correct diagnosis of musculoskeletal tuberculosis. Conclusion: The proper diagnosis of musculoskeletal tuberculosis is clinically challenging due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis variants involved and atypical presentations, especially when the lesions are multiple. Our findings indicate that multiple tuberculous spondylitis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of multiple musculoskeletal lesions.  2016 Ye et al."

Despite the high prevalence of M. tuberculosis bacteremia in these settings it is underrecognized. This is in part because timely diagnosis of M. tuberculosis bacteremia is difficult using traditional TB diagnostics. Novel triage algorithms and rapid diagnostic tests are needed to expedite the identification and treatment of patients with severe sepsis due to M. tuberculosis bacteremia. In this article, we emphasize the importance of M. tuberculosis bacteremia as an under-recognized etiology of severe sepsis, and discuss the potential role of two emerging rapid diagnostic tests in the triage and prognostication of critically ill patients with advanced HIV infection and suspected disseminated M. tuberculosis. We conclude with the recommendation that clinicians in high TB-HIV burden settings strongly consider empiric anti-tuberculosis treatment in patients with advanced HIV infection and severe sepsis in the appropriate clinical context. Future studies are needed to assess diagnostic and prognostic algorithms for severe sepsis caused by disseminated M. tuberculosis in these settings, and the safety, efficacy, and duration of empiric anti-tuberculosis treatment.  2015 The Union."

The diagnosis of paediatric and extrapulmonary disease is problematic and there are, as yet, no rapid screening tests to assist active case finding in the community. Progress has been made in clinic-based detection tools with the introduction of Xpert MTB/RIF, a nucleic acid amplification test that combines sample processing and analysis in a single instrument to provide a diagnostic result and detection of resistance to rifampicin in under 2. h. Enthusiasm for Xpert MTB/RIF has been high and global rollout has been facilitated by donor agencies. However, concerns remain about access and sustainability due to the high cost and infrastructure requirements. Although more sensitive than smear microscopy, early studies suggest the impact of the new test on case detection rates and patient survival has been limited. Alternative technologies are being developed, including non-sputum-based tests to assist the detection of extrapulmonary disease. Evaluation studies are needed to provide evidence of the impact of the new technologies on patient outcomes. This will enable appropriate placement of new diagnostic products in the healthcare system to support the control and eventual eradication of tuberculosis disease.  2015 The Authors."

However, little is known about the usefulness of these assays for diagnosing disseminated TB. We therefore compared their usefulness with traditional tests in patients with disseminated TB. All adult patients with suspected disseminated TB were prospectively enrolled at a tertiary hospital in an intermediate TB-burden country during a 6-year period. Disseminated TB was defined as involvement of the bone marrow or 2 noncontiguous organs, or presence of miliary lung lesions. A total of 101 patients with confirmed and probable disseminated TB were finally analyzed. Of these 101 patients, 52 (52%) had miliary TB and the remaining 49 (48%) had nonmiliary disseminated TB. In addition, 63 (62%) had no underlying disease. Chronic granuloma with/without necrosis, acid-fast bacillus staining, Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR, and culture for M tuberculosis were positive in 77% (41/53), 43% (43/101), 70% (67/96), and 72% (73/101), of the patients, respectively. The T-SPOT.TB assay was positive in 90% (91/101) of them. The sensitivity of the TSPOT. TB assay in patients with miliary TB (90%) was similar to that in patients with nonmiliary TB (90%) (P> 0.99). In a subgroup analysis of the 58 patients in whom both QFT-GIT and the T-SPOT.TB results were available, the sensitivity of QFT-GIT (67%) was lower than that of T-SPOT.TB (95%) (P<0.001). In conclusion, T-SPOT.TB assay may be a helpful adjunct test for disseminated TB. Copyright  2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."

However, little is known about the role of other complement components in tuberculosis. Methods: Complement gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of tuberculosis patients and controls were determined using whole genome transcriptional microarray assays. The mRNA and protein levels of three C1q components, C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC, were further validated by qRT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The percentages of C1q expression in CD14 positive cells were determined by flow cytometry. Finally, C1qC protein level was quantified in the pleural fluid of tuberculosis and non-tuberculosis pleurisy. Results: C1q expression increases significantly in the peripheral blood of patients with active tuberculosis compared to healthy controls and individuals with latent TB infection. The percentage of C1q-expressing CD14 positive cells is significantly increased in active TB patients. C1q expression in the peripheral blood correlates with sputum smear positivity in tuberculosis patients and is reduced after anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. Notably, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that C1qC mRNA levels in peripheral blood efficiently discriminate active from latent tuberculosis infection and healthy controls. Additionally, C1qC protein level in pleural effusion shows improved power in discriminating tuberculosis from non-tuberculosis pleurisy when compared to other inflammatory markers, such as IL-6 and TNF-. Conclusions: C1q expression correlates with active disease in human tuberculosis. C1q could be a potential diagnostic marker to discriminate active tuberculosis from latent tuberculosis infection as well as tuberculosis pleurisy from non-tuberculosis pleurisy.  2014 Cai et al."

The study was carried out in 89 patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB as defined by the Brazilian Manual for TB Treatment. The participants were recruited in a reference unit for TB treatment in Rondnia, a state in the Amazonian area in northern Brazil. ZN, PCR, and culture performed in the sputum samples from these patients were analyzed in different combinations (i.e., ZN plus PCR and ZN plus culture). The prevalence rates of pulmonary TB in these patients were 32.6 and 28.1% considering culture and ZN/PCR, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of ZN/PCR were 86 and 93%, respectively. ZN/PCR was able to detect more TB cases than ZN alone.

This process requires 48 to 72 hours. The rapid administration of the most appropriate antimicrobial treatment is crucial for the survival of septic patients; therefore, a rapid method that enables diagnosis directly from analysis of a blood sample without culture is needed. A recently developed platform that couples broad-range PCR amplification of pathogen DNA with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS) has the ability to identify virtually any microorganism from direct clinical specimens. To date, two clinical evaluations of the PCR/ESI-MS technology for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections from whole blood have been published. Here we discuss them and describe recent improvements that result in an enhanced sensitivity. Other commercially available assays for the molecular diagnosis of bloodstream infections from whole blood are also reviewed. The use of highly sensitive molecular diagnostic methods in combination with conventional procedures could substantially improve the management of septic patients.  2014 Elena Jordana-Lluch et al."

Typical symptoms of tuberculosis have become more and more confusing due to the genetic evolution of different Mycobacterium species. In the diagnosis of tuberculous otitis media (TOM), clinical suspicion plays a fundamental role, when topical and/or systemic antibiotic treatment cannot lead to improvement in ear discharge and inflammation. If there is no other reason of persisting otorrhea, microbiological sampling and culturing are the subsequent steps of diagnosis. These investigations, however, have low sensitivity; therefore a canal wall-up mastoidectomy is recommended, which includes the removal of necrotic bone and multiple histological sampling from various locations. Currently, histopathological analysis is the most robust and reliable method in the diagnosis of TOM. Tuberculin skin test, Mycobacterium-specific PCR and interferon-gamma release assay cannot distinguish between active, inactive or post-infective conditions. According to these considerations, these methods may serve as supplementary assays for the final diagnosis. Having the appropriate diagnosis after surgical intervention and laboratory analysis, medical management should be continued by anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy. Hereby, we demonstrate two cases with primary TOM and provide an overview of the literature in the light of diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines in the management of TOM.  2014 Springer-Verlag."

Methods: A total of 3741 study cases were divided into two groups, test and validation set at cut-off value of 6000 WBCs/L. We developed multiparametric model for primary TB screening (TB hemeprint), selected CPD, and calculated parameters which could discriminate primary TB from other non-TB diseases and normal control in test set. We applied it to the validation set, which was a set of completely different samples, to test its reproducibility if applied to a routine laboratory test. Results: After screening primary TB using TB hemeprint, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 85.4%, 89.6%, 31.1%, and 99.1%, respectively, in primary TB with lower than 6000 WBCs/L of test set (test set-L). In primary TB with higher than 6000 WBCs/L of test set (test set-H), those values were 83.1%, 85.6%, 29.7%, and 98.6%, respectively. There were only 0.4% (2/461) and 0.6% (2/326) of normal control samples included in test set-L and -H, respectively.

Although sporadic cases in deep soft tissue and visceral organs have been reported, we present here the first description of AFH developing in a large artery. Methods and results: Paraffin sections of the surgical specimen were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and immunohistochemistry was performed (CKAE1/AE3, EMA, CD34, p63, CD38, smooth muscle actin, and desmin). In addition, FISH and RT-PCR were applied in order to check for EWRS rearrangement. The histomorphological features, and FISH analysis revealing rearrangement of EWSR, indicated the definitive diagnosis of AFH. RT-PCR confirmed EWSR rearrangement, and detected an EWSR1-ATF1 fusion transcript. Conclusions: A thoracic location of AFH has not been reported until very recently, and shares a differential diagnosis with diverse neoplasms, including spindle cell carcinoma and low-grade sarcoma. We describe the first reported case of thoracic AFH arising in a large vessel, and highlight distinctive histological and molecular features.  2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

Although invasive fungal infection (IFI) is a growing public health problem, studies of IFI in ESLD are lacking. The aims of this study were to screen for IFI in ESLD and to assess risk factors and serum interleukin 17 (IL-17) as a marker of the cellular immune response. Methods: Both blood and ascitic fluid samples were collected from 46 patients with ESLD for fungal culture and PCR. Serum IL-17 levels were determined. Results: Seven patients had isolated IFI (four had spontaneous fungal peritonitis, two had fungemia, and one had a disseminated fungal infection) and five cases had combined fungal and bacterial infections. Spontaneous fungal peritonitis was attributed to Candida species, while fungemia was caused by Aspergillus species. Patients with IFI had higher serum IL-17 levels and increased mortality compared to patients without IFI. A history of antibiotic use (p = 0.002), higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores (p = 0.04), and hepatorenal syndrome (p = 0.006) were risk factors for IFI. Conclusions: Patients with ESLD had a low frequency of IFI; however, in patients with these infections, delayed diagnosis and treatment may contribute to a high fatality rate. Thus, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for this unusual but lethal entity, as prompt detection and appropriate treatment can improve the outcome.  2014 The Authors."

It usually presents the toxic symptoms of tuberculosis but rarely with symptoms characteristic of esophageal compression, such as dysphagia. Such patients can easily be misdiagnosed as esophageal neoplasm and get delayed or faulty treatment. Case report: A 32-year-old man presented with dull chest pain of one month and dysphagia of five days. CRP was elevated, and a skin test was strongly positive. At upper endoscopy, a protruding lesion covered by normal mucosa was seen at 26 cm from the upper incisor. Barium swallow showed visible external compressive stricture on the middle-lower esophagus with normal mucosal pattern. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a subcarinal mass adjacent to the esophageal wall in posterior mediastinum. An endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a hypoechoic lesion suspected of esophageal stromal tumor in the fourth layer. A tissue was obtained by ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), but cytopathology, bacilliculture and PCR test had no special findings. The patient required experimental antitubercular treatment and the protruding lesion shrank gradually during therapy period. Conclusions: MTL could not be ignored in the differential diagnosis of posterior mediastinal mass with dysphagia. Analyzing and evaluating test results comprehensively is the key to make correct diagnosis and timely treatment. The experimental antituberculous treatment should be used if MTL is highly suspected.

In this delayedtype cross-sectional study, 113 HIV-infected symptomatic patients were evaluated by an adjudication committee after clinical follow-up to establish the presence or absence of VL as the target condition (reference test). The index tests were recombinant K39 antigen-based immunochromatographic test (rK39), indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), prototype kit of direct agglutination test (DAT-LPC), and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in peripheral blood. Compared with parasitological test and adjudication committee diagnosis or latent class model analyses, IFAT and rk39 dipstick test presented the lowest sensitivity. DAT-LPC exhibited good overall performance, and there was no statistical difference between DAT-LPC and qPCR diagnosis accuracy. Real-time PCR emerges as a less invasive alternative to parasitological examination for confirmation of cases not identified by DAT.

Cell-mediated immune responses are assumed to be protective and therefore, to be associated with its more delimited lesion types, while humoral responses are mainly associated with diffuse histopathological lesions. However, this duality of immune responses has been recently questioned. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between both types of immunological responses and the type and extension of intestinal lesions and the presence of MAP in bovine tissues. Standard histopathological examinations, two microbiological procedures (culture and real time PCR (rtPCR)), as well as MAP specific antibody and interferon gamma (IFN-) release assays (IGRA) were performed on tissues and blood of 333 slaughtered Holstein-Friesian animals. Paratuberculous lesions were observed in 176 (52.9%) of the animals and overall MAP detection rates were estimated at 13.5% and 28.5% for tissue culture and rtPCR, respectively. Unlike the relatively constant non-specific IFN- release, both the antibody levels and the specific IFN- release significantly increased with tissue damage. Delimited immunopathological forms, which accounted for 93.2% of all forms, were mostly related to positive testing in the IGRA (38.4%) whereas diffuse ones (6.8%) were associated with antibody seropositivity (91.7%). However, since the frequency of positive immune responses in both tests increased as the lesions severity increased, polarization of Th1/Th2 responses was less prominent than expected. MAP was detected in the majority of ELISA-positive animals (culture+: 90%, rtPCR+: 85%) but the bacteria was only confirmed in the 36.1% of IGRA-positive animals by any of the two microbiological tests. In terms of diagnosis, the antibody test was a good indicator of advanced tissue damage (diffuse forms), but the IGRA did not associate well with more delimited forms or with MAP detection.  2013 Vazquez et al."

A delay in diagnosis is likely to increase the morbidity in these patients. We developed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 16SrRNA, IS6110, and devR, and evaluated it in comparison with other conventional tests in clinical suspects of abdominal TB. A total of 183 patients with clinical suspicion of abdominal TB (96 patients with intestinal TB and 87 with peritoneal TB) were enrolled for the study. Endoscopic or intraoperative biopsies were collected from patients suspected of intestinal TB and ascitic fluid was collected from patients with a suspicion of peritoneal TB. Of the intestinal tuberculosis group, there were 40 confirmed cases and 56 controls, while of the peritoneal tuberculosis group there were 37 confirmed cases and 50 controls. Multiplex PCR showed a high sensitivity and specificity in both the intestinal TB and peritoneal TB groups. When combined with histopathology, multiplex PCR could detect 97.5% of all the cases in the intestinal tuberculosis group, while in combination adenosine deaminase levels (ADA) in cases of peritoneal tuberculosis it increased the specificity of diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis to 95%. In combination with histopathology in suspected intestinal TB cases, and ADA testing in suspected peritoneal TB cases, it can be used as a highly sensitive, specific, and rapid diagnostic tool with the ability to supplement the limitations of other diagnostic modalities.  2013 Elsevier Inc."

IFN- mRNA was evaluated as an indicator of IGRA in comparison with QFT-IT IFN- ELISA in 46 subjects with active TB and in 73 at low risk for TB. Significant IFN- mRNA expression was detected from 30 min and peaked 4 h after stimulation with MTB antigens or mitogen. This was defined as the optimal time point for IFN- mRNA real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Nevertheless, current studies suggest that a single test is not enough to detect all cattle infected by TB, particularly when animals present different stages of infection. A dairy herd comprised of 270 cows was studied and 15 were reactive to SITT plus nine inconclusive animals. Blood samples (for IFN and ELISA) were collected from these 24 cows. At 30 days after injection of PPD, all the cows that were reactive to any of the employed tests were slaughtered, and tissues were processed by Bacteriology, Histopathology (HP) and PCR. According to HP 33.4% of the animals were positive, 45.8% inconclusive and 20.8% were negative. The inconclusive samples came from IFN positive animals, signalizing recent infection. Regarding the animals that were negative to HP, all of them were identified by IFN while ELISA was negative. Immune responses are different in recent and advanced infections, what supports the identification between chronically or recently infected animals. This multidisciplinary approach is mandatory for the interpretation of the various tools that are frequently employed for the diagnosis of TB and mainly to identify all infected animals."

These risks are greatly compounded by multidrug-resistant disease. Screening and diagnosis of TB in this clinical setting is difficult. However, progress has beenmade in defining a high-sensitivity, standardized symptom screening tool that assesses a combination of symptoms, rather than relying on report of cough alone. Moreover, newly emerging diagnostic tools show great promise in providing more rapid diagnosis of TB, which is predominantly sputum smear-negative. These include culture-based systems, simplified versions of nucleic acid amplification tests (such as the Xpert MTB/RIF assay), and detection of lipoarabinomannan antigen in urine. In addition, new molecular diagnostics now permit rapid detection of drug resistance. Further development and implementation of these tools is vital to permit rapid and effective screening for TB in ART services, which is an essential component of patient care.  The Author 2011."

However, the factors influencing the pathogen clearance and disease progression from latent infection are poorly understood. This study attempted to use a genome-wide transcriptome approach to identify immune factors associated with MTB infection and novel biomarkers that can distinguish active disease from latent infection. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using microarray analysis, we comprehensively determined the transcriptional difference in purified protein derivative (PPD) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in 12 individuals divided into three groups: TB patients (TB), latent TB infection individuals (LTBI) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 4 per group). A transcriptional profiling of 506 differentially expressed genes could correctly group study individuals into three clusters. Moreover, 55- and 229-transcript signatures for tuberculosis infection (TB&LTBI) and active disease (TB) were identified, respectively. The validation study by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) performed in 83 individuals confirmed the expression patterns of 81% of the microarray identified genes. Decision tree analysis indicated that three genes of CXCL10, ATP10A and TLR6 could differentiate TB from LTBI subjects. Additional validation was performed to assess the diagnostic ability of the three biomarkers within 36 subjects, which yielded a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 89%. Conclusions/Significance: The transcription profiles of PBMCs induced by PPD identified distinctive gene expression patterns associated with different infectious status and provided new insights into human immune responses to MTB. Furthermore, this study indicated that a combination of CXCL10, ATP10A and TLR6 could be used as novel biomarkers for the discrimination of TB from LTBI.  2011 Lu et al."

India has more new TB cases annually than any other country. In 2008, India accounted for a fifth of the estimated 9.4 million TB cases globally. There is an overwhelming need for improving TB diagnostics in India through the use of cost effective, patient-friendly methods appropriate to different tiers of the country health system. Substantial progress has been made in India in the field of TB diagnosis and serious efforts have been made to herald the development of diagnostic tests for pulmonary TB, extra pulmonary TB and MDR-TB. Diverse approaches have been attempted towards improving smear microscopy, rapid culture and for differentiation between the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Several laboratories have developed in-house PCR assays for diagnosing TB with high accuracy. Approaches for distinguishing M. tuberculosis and/or Mycobacterium bovis infection and disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection in HIV-AIDS patients have also been described. Serological tests to detect antigens or antibodies to M. tuberculosis specific components by using cocktails of Excretory/Secretory protein antigens, Ag85 complex antigens, Hsp 65 antigen, RD1 antigens and Rapid Reverse Line Blot Hybridization assays to detect MDR-TB (mutations to rifampicin, isoniazid and streptomycin) have also been developed. Other methods like measurement of adenosine deaminase activity and use of luciferase reporter phages have also been explored for TB diagnosis. These advances in the Indian context are detailed in the present chapter. The validation and application of these methods in laboratory and public health settings is likely to result in improved TB diagnosis and contribute to effective disease management in India.  2011 Elsevier Ltd.

With the aim of evaluating the usefulness of a nested-PCR method on samples of blood and urine of patients suspected of tuberculosis we analyzed 192 clinical samples, using as a molecular target the insertion element IS6110 specific of M. tuberculosis genome. Nested-PCR method showed higher sensitivity in patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis (47.8% and 52% in blood and urine) when compared to patients with the pulmonary form of the disease (sensitivity of 29% and 26.9% in blood and urine), regardless of the type of biological sample used. The nested-PCR is a rapid technique that, even if not showing a good sensitivity, should be considered as a helpful tool especially in the extrapulmonary cases or in cases where confirmatory diagnosis is quite difficult to be achieved by routine methods. The performance of PCR-based techniques should be considered and tested in future works on other types of biological specimens besides sputum, like blood and urine, readily obtainable in most cases. The improving of M. tuberculosis nested-PCR detection in TB affected patients will give the possibility of an earlier detection of bacilli thus interrupting the transmission chain of the disease."

Data about the value of new diagnostic technologies are limited, particularly, in high burden settings. Preliminary case control studies have identified IFN--inducible-10kDa protein (IP-10) as a promising diagnostic marker; however, its diagnostic utility in a day-to-day clinical setting is unclear. Detection of LAM antigen has not previously been evaluated in pleural fluid. Methods: We investigated the comparative diagnostic utility of established (adenosine deaminase [ADA]), more recent (standardized nucleic-acid-amplification-test [NAAT]) and newer technologies (a standardized LAM mycobacterial antigen-detection assay and IP-10 levels) for the evaluation of pleural effusions in 78 consecutively recruited South African tuberculosis suspects. All consenting participants underwent pleural biopsy unless contra-indicated or refused. The reference standard comprised culture positivity for M. tuberculosis or histology suggestive of tuberculosis. Principal Findings: Of 74 evaluable subjects 48, 7 and 19 had definite, probable and non-TB, respectively. IP-10 levels were significantly higher in TB vs non-TB participants (p<0.0001). The respective outcomes [sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV %] for the different diagnostic modalities were: ADA at the 30 IU/L cut-point [96; 69; 90; 85], NAAT [6; 93; 67; 28], IP-10 at the 28,170 pg/ml ROC-derived cut-point [80; 82; 91; 64], and IP-10 at the 4035 pg/ml cut-point [100; 53; 83; 100]. Thus IP-10, using the ROC-derived cut-point, missed 20% of TB cases and mis-diagnosed 20% of non-TB cases. By contrast, when a lower cut-point was used a negative test excluded TB. The NAAT had a poor sensitivity but high specificity. LAM antigen-detection was not diagnostically useful. Conclusion: Although IP-10, like ADA, has sub-optimal specificity, it may be a clinically useful rule-out test for tuberculous pleural effusions. Larger multi-centric studies are now required to confirm our findings. Copyright:  2009 Dheda et al."

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of hPCR sensitivity and specificity for smear-positive TB diagnosis, using culture as the reference standard. After searching English language studies in MEDLINE and EMBASE, we estimated cumulative accuracy by means of summary receiver operating characteristic analysis. The possible influence of hPCR procedures and study methodological features on accuracy was explored by univariate metaregression, followed by multivariate adjustment of items selected as significant. Thirty-five articles (1991 to 2006) met the inclusion criteria. The pooled estimates of the diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, and specificity (random-effect model) were, respectively, 60 (confidence interval [CI], 29 to 123), 0.96 (CI, 0.95 to 0.97), and 0.81 (CI, 0.78 to 0.84), but significant variations (mainly in specificity) limit their clinical applicability. The quality of the reference test, the detection method, and real-time PCR use explained some of the observed heterogeneity. Probably due to the limited study power of our meta-analysis and to the wide differences in both laboratory techniques and methodological quality, only real-time PCR also displayed a positive impact on accuracy in the multivariate model. Currently, hPCR can be confidently used to exclude TB in smear-positive patients, but its low specificity could lead to erroneous initiation of therapy, isolation, and contact investigation. As the inclusion of samples from treated patients could have artificially reduced specificity, future studies should report mycobacterial-culture results for each TB and non-TB sample analyzed.

In mainland China, only six cases have been reported with a morbidity rate up to 1%-2%. Definitive diagnosis was achieved by molecular techniques (HLA typing or PCR-STR) in only two cases and the remaining cases were diagnosed based on typical clinical features with exclusion of other possible causes. All patients died of septic shock or multiple organ failure even after administration of increased corticosteroids and supportive therapy, and reduced immunosuppressive agents. In our center, two cases of GVHD were found among 128 (1.56%) patients. One case was diagnosed by detecting lymphocyte macrochimerism through DNA-STR. Both of them died even after aggressive treatment. In China, the incidence of GVHD is similar to that reported by foreign centers except for an extremely bad prognosis. Rapid diagnosis is crucial for a better prognosis. In China, only 37.5% of cases are diagnosed by molecular methods.

Methods: cDNA fragments encoding M2-reactive epitopes of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E2 (PDC-E2), branched chain 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complex E2 (BCOADC-E2) and 2-oxo-glutarate dehydrogenase complex E2 (OGDC-E2) were amplified with PCR using total RNA extracted from human peripheral mononuclear blood cells. The fragments were cloned into the plasmid vector pQE-30 and then transferred into E. coli M15 (pREP4) for expression, which was induced by isopropylthio--D-galactoside. The expressed recombinant BPO protein was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE, Western-blotting and Immunoabsorption test, its antigenic reactivity and specificity were identified with seven M2-positive sera confirmed at Euroimmun Research Center (Germany). Using the purified BPO, M2 antibodies in sera from patients with PBC and other liver related diseases were detected with ELISA. Results: The expressed BPO was observed with both antigenic reactivity and specificity of M2 autoantigens. The determination of M2 antibodies by BPO with ELISA was more sensitive than using the Euroimmun's kit with the coefficients of variation less than 10 % in both interassay and intraassay. With the newly established method, M2 antibodies were found in 100 % (20/20) of patients with PBC. Six cases of liver disease with unknown etiology and 1 patient with drug induced liver injury had detectable levels of serum M2 antibodies. There were also 2 patients with autoimmune cholangitis and 1 with autoimmune hepatitis showing M2-antibody positive. Conclusion: Compared with the routine immunofluorescence assay and commercially available assay kit using porcine heart mitochondrial protein as the antigen, the detection system established in the present study shows higher sensitivity and specificity and may be used as a powerful tool for the diagnosis of PBC."

The patient was hospitalized due to disturbance of consciousness, and dialysis therapy was performed because of end-stage renal failure. Approximately 1 week later, abnormal shadows were observed on chest X-ray, and various examinations were performed until the diagnosis was finally determined as miliary tuberculosis. Disturbance of consciousness was exacerbated, despite the administration of antituberculosis drugs and other treatments, and the patient died on the 105th hospital day. Pathological examinations demonstrated miliary tuberculosis associated with intracranial involvement, in addition to contracted kidneys. In patients with end-stage renal failure, the risk of developing tuberculosis, miliary tuberculosis in particular, is reported to be much higher than in normal subjects. However, the diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis is difficult to establish, because of nonspecific symptoms and the low rate of detection of acid-fast bacteria from the sputum. Comprehensive understanding of the results of frequent culture examinations of sputum and blood, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of cerebrospinal fluid, as well as albumin concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, are considered useful in diagnosing intracranial tuberculosis. Although cerebral tuberculoma is rare, prolonged disturbance of consciousness may be related to cerebral tuberculosis. Therefore, particular attention should be paid to patients with end-stage renal failure complicated by disturbance of consciousness."

The nodule developed on an asymptomatic, slowly growing plaque which appeared during childhood. Physical examination revealed two erythematous plaques covering the posterior and right lateral aspects of the neck. The border of the plaques was soft, circinate, with a reddish-brown color, while the center was slightly erythematous and atrophic. An ulcerated nodule measuring 2 cm was seen on one of the plaques (Fig. 1). Physical examination was unremarkable with no lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests, including complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and routine chemistry tests, were all within normal limits. Chest X-ray showed a small calcified perihilar lymph node. The Mantoux test was positive with erythema and induration of 15 mm after 48 h. Biopsy from a plaque showed extensive diffuse granulomatous infiltration throughout the dermis with epithelioid and Langhans giant cells surrounded by mononuclear inflammatory cells. No caseation necrosis was present. Ziehl-Neelsen, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), and Giemsa stains were negative. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria from a skin sample was also negative. Fresh tissue cultures yielded M. tuberculosis after 6 weeks. A biopsy specimen from the ulcerated nodule demonstrated islands of atypical malignant squamous cells invading the dermis, which were compatible with moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (Fig. 2). The ulcerated nodule was completely excised, and treatment for tuberculosis was initiated with a combination of isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide. Within 3 months of therapy, the patient's lesions resolved, leaving only slightly atrophic hypopigmented scars. A month after the treatment's initiation, an enlarged cervical lymph node was noted showing metastatic SCC on histologic examination. The patient underwent neck dissection and radiation therapy without evidence of any further metastases."

Materials and Methods: Intravesical BCG immunotherapy was given to 22 consecutive patients with superficial bladder tumors. In 2 patients the BCG instillation had to be discontinued due to serious side effects of therapy. Blood samples (252 aliquots) were obtained from 126 BCG courses in 22 cases, and 2 additional samples (4 aliquots) were obtained from 1 patient 1 and 3 months after cessation of therapy. All blood samples were analyzed by the PCR technique for detection of deoxyribonucleic acid tuberculosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Results: Of the 126 blood samples 9 (7.1%) were PCR positive for M. tuberculosis. These 9 positive samples belonged to S patients, all of whom were among those 4 patients who had major clinical side effects. Conclusions: We demonstrated that rapid and sensitive detection of mycobacteremia by PCR correlated with the clinical course of these patients. We also demonstrated that PCR can be used to monitor BCG in the blood after antituberculous therapy. The early, fast and accurate diagnosis of BCG in the blood by PCR may alter the serious clinical course of these patients by initiation of specific treatment early. However, further extensive studies are needed to validate these results."

Clinical investigators who were unaware of the PCR data classified 162 immunocompetent patients, who had been hospitalized because of suspected pulmonary tuberculosis, in accordance with the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society (ATS). By testing blood samples from these patients for mycobacterial DNA with three different PCR systems, we were able to demonstrate that nonquantitative PCR of peripheral blood leukocytes is of little value for the specific diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis. However, semiquantitative PCR assays might have some significance since we found an increasing level of mycobacterial DNA copies in blond from patients classified in ATS groups 2 to 5."

We have improved our previously reported PCR based on the amplification of a fragment of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex- specific insertion element IS6110 with respect to both problems. False- positive reactions caused by amplicon contamination were prevented by the use of uracil-N-glycosylase and dUTP instead of dTTP. We selected a new set of primers outside the region spanned by the formerly used primers to avoid false-positive reactions caused by dTTP-containing amplicons still present in the laboratory. With this new primer set, 16 copies of the IS6110 insertion element, the equivalent of two bacteria, could be amplified 1010 times in 40 cycles, resulting in a mean efficiency of 77% per cycle. To detect the presence of inhibitors of the Taq polymerase, which may cause false-negative reactions, part of each sample was spiked with M. tuberculosis DNA. The DNA purification method using guanidinium thiocyanate and diatoms effectively removed most or all inhibitors of the PCR. However, this was not suitable for blood samples, for which we developed a proteinase K treatment followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. This method permitted detection of 20 M. tuberculosis bacteria per ml of whole blood. Various laboratory procedures were introduced to reduce failure or inhibition of PCR and avoid DNA cross contamination. We have tested 218 different clinical specimens obtained from patients suspected of having tuberculosis. The samples included sputum (n = 145), tissue biopsy samples (n = 25), cerebrospinal fluid (n = 15), blood (n = 14), pleural fluid (n = 9), feces (n = 7), fluid from fistulae (n = 2), and pus from a wound (n = 1). The results obtained by PCR were consistent with those obtained with culture, which is the 'gold standard.' We demonstrate that PCR is a useful technique for the rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis at various sites."

In this test, a 245-bp sequence of the insertion element IS986 was amplified and detected by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide and by Southern blot and dot blot hybridization by using a 188-bp digoxigenin-labeled probe. We tested clinical specimens from 227 patients suspected of having tuberculosis. These included 102 cerebrospinal fluid, 48 sputum, 18 pleural fluid, 5 bronchoalveolar lavage, 18 blood, 7 pus, 8 bone marrow, and 6 urine samples and 15 tissue biopsy specimens. We also tested sputum samples from 75 patients with diseases other than tuberculosis. Sputum samples were first decontaminated, and all samples were treated with proteinase K-detergent solution to extract the DNA. Part of each sample was spiked with M. tuberculosis to provide a semiquantitative assay and to control for the loss of mycobacteria or interference with the PCR which may cause false-negative results. One femtogram of M. tuberculosis DNA could be detected. PCR was positive for all 32 culture-positive (for M. tuberculosis) and Ziehl-Neelsen staining (ZN)-positive samples, 10 of 12 culture-positive and ZN-negative samples, and all 4 culture-negative and ZN-positive samples. PCR detected M. tuberculosis complex bacteria in 35 of 178 culture- and ZN- negative samples. Clinical data supported the diagnosis of tuberculosis in the majority of the 35 patients from whom those samples were obtained."
